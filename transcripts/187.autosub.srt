40
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
From the heart

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880

Are you to hear Karen Castillo

61
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
The setup it's not really I'm just too

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,040
Is underwhelming cuz every episode starts with her adoption

63
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Sometimes it's a surprise on the

64
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
It's not at all so it's not a surprise Kira's carry opening up the show

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
Using us to what

66
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Is going to be

67
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
Hi everyone I'm sure Cassidy from Project Camelot and

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Sorry for the late start here we've

69
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Just had all kinds of

70
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,568
At any rate I'm here with Ben emlyn Jones

71
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
And I'm very happy

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
On the show

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
There's

74
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
Such a great amount of

75
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
He's been covering and

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
He's an investigator

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Fascinating woman

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Call Ellen Duncan

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
And as I wrote

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
On my

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
Below in the chat basically she

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
Her story is that she was

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
In prison

84
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
By Ian Fleming Fleming with the help of Ian Fleming

85
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Oh boy

86
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
I was

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
My first thought when she

88
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
She said Helen there's a little Plaza

89
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
Is it going to make a documentary about Helen Keller

90
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
Tim Burton

91
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
I don't know I don't

92
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Blame

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Probably the misconception

94
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Monkeybone

95
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
No no it was

96
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
It was directed by the person

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
The reason is

98
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,135
Monkeybone was all about like from the director of Nightmare Before Christmas

99
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
From Nightmare Before Christmas

100
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
And then had nothing to do with monkey

101
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Exactly

102
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
So

103
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Nightmare Before Christmas

104
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Implied

105
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
Bratz movie theater monkey bone came out

106
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Everyone was

107
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
Furious they all like all these nerves one of their money back

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:47,391
I couldn't blame them but I'm like popcorn I can't help

109
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Churchill who is the Raven Tim Burton

110
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Yeah that could be

111
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
Yeah I'm still in together

112
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Conspired to make his movie

113
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
No but I feel like I did

114
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
Like I knew the name like the names

115
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Familiar to me but now I

116
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
And now I just don't

117
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Not certain

118
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Viewed wood

119
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
You like

120
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
I don't know

121
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
Duncan was a spiritualist in medium operating for

122
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
I'm about

123
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
26 and tell her ass tonight

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
44

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
She's creating harmless hoaxes for a really long time was left

126
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Largely to harambe

127
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
Only occasionally running afoul of the law generally resulting

128
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Minor signs

129
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
For fraud

130
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
People with seance

131
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Along the road

132
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Right I have a lot to get in

133
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
About about her

134
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
And this was in Britain right

135
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
I believe one of the reasons that I might know this

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Because

137
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,623
This wasn't like I was reading about Harry Houdini and how he was

138
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Essentially ghost busting

139
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
At the same time

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
Feel good

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
And that became a whole thing and there was a guy who did that

142
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
I don't know is anyone necessarily

143
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
Did that with her as opposed

144
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
A lot of

145
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
People

146
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
So

147
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
I'm going to let this play and then I'll get some information

148
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
Because I'm not sure exactly where it's relevant

149
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
You know I want this Ben gentleman

150
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
For him to hang himself a little bit

151
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Nope

152
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
Why

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Or it could have been a quince

154
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
I don't know why she would have been out there the story is apocryphal anyway I don't know

155
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,711
Willington

156
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
Randomness any of those things are much more likely

157
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
I don't know maybe your dad was a cop

158
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Even like it just would

159
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
And involve just the police looking for

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
So

161
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
Dial talk a little bit about her adult

162
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
So in November 9th

163
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
41

164
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Where she claimed that the

165
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
The spirit of a sailor aboard HMS Barham

166
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Had appeared to her and told her that the

167
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
The ship has sunk

168
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
This is a bit of an issue

169
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Because I didn't formation

170
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
Was not made public until January 9th

171
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
42

172
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
This information was only told

173
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
The family members of the

174
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
People lost on

175
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
HMS Barham

176
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
806

177
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,519
61 people on board

178
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Reconsider how many family members that makes

179
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
You consider that all it takes

180
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
For one of these

181
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
These people to talk about it for the secret

182
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
To get out, this is the vision that this information wasn't

183
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Researchers

184
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
Nation nearly a secret

185
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Is the government

186
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Many people know about

187
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Before

188
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
So the fact that she knew about it means that

189
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
But you just had her.

190
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Some like loose talk

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Bob and decided to use a jaguar

192
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Seances

193
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Get the government's attention

194
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
So they started to look into an amazing way the spirits

195
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
She allegedly was

196
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Contact with

197
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
We're often not real dad

198
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Is one example of a like a guy who went and she was like

199
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm talking to your dad

200
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
Beybladers like I found your sisters

201
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
My sister's alive everybody

202
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
He has a bad that

203
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,935
From time to time right to her and all this

204
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
There was little sign

205
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
The came along running afoul of fraud laws in

206
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
And stuff like that

207
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
Obscure old laws

208
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Actor 1735 to throw in prison

209
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
All right I don't like right now I'm not on anybody. All bottles

210
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
If you're if you're using the Witchcraft Act

211
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Charger

212
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
To charge the 1944

213
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
And because was kind of trumped-up bulshit

214
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
19:45

215
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
You promise to stop holding

216
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
He was arrested for conducting seances again in 1956 and died shortly

217
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Listen

218
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
This is a lot of like this

219
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
To give you the

220
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Basic

221
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Picture

222
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
Of like why were the police

223
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Draw the suspicions of the government

224
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
I haven't

225
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Shown

226
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
You yet exactly why I'm positive

227
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
The fraud

228
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Trying to get the sense that like

229
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Okay someone running seances back

230
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Pen for money

231
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,215
Was probably the one that gave it away

232
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
The run-of-the-mill stuff

233
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
You know that you know John Edward kind of

234
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Levels of like yeah you guys are all

235
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
You guys are all running back

236
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
And you know what we all kind of know it's like everybody goes to the Sands doesn't believe in that shape

237
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,231
They just want that comfortable even for a moment

238
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
Helen

239
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Further

240
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
Helen Duncan

241
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Was

242
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
The LeBron James of seances

243
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
Killed that Aunt and then Seance the f*** out of that ants

244
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Metaphorically

245
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Is it clip

246
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Then

247
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Power for me

248
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
All time

249
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Which is manifestation

250
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
Manifestation

251
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Physical objects

252
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
Or Slimer from Ghostbusters

253
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Interesting

254
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
You know

255
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Way to look at it

256
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
There's other way

257
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
So Jordan

258
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
The way her seances Woodwork and this is he

259
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Made clear there

260
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
Apart from other mediums

261
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Is the cheek

262
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Said she could manifest things into the world that work there

263
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
So she would create this ectoplasm they would come out of her mouth Jenner

264
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
Plaza would be connected to apparitions

265
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Showing up in a very dark room

266
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Where's your conductor seance

267
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
Photographer named Harvey Metcalfe showed up

268
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
Flash photography

269
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
Covered in a sheet

270
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Discovered

271
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Somehow this Revelation did not destroy Helens business model and chic

272
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
In 1931 the London spiritualist Academy started has some questions about Helen's meth

273
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
I would imagine that they were thinking. Hey this person

274
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Do things that literally no one else

275
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Can do I wonder what's up with that

276
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
I'm so they open

277
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Examination

278
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
Very quickly they were able to determine that the way Helen produce ectoplasm was by ingesting a bunch of

279
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Throwing it back up performatively

280
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,119
The room was dark and sometimes she would lock herself in a cabinet

281
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
The most usual method for ectoplasm however seem to be butter mucilin or cheese

282
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
Cheesecloth probably swallowed in Woodridge

283
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,871
Distressing choking noises were sometimes from What epic app

284
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,223
Cuz she couldn't throw it up

285
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
They used to give people a lot of the benefit of the doubt

286
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
A crazy about this magical stuff but I have to go make throw up noises

287
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
What are you doing

288
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
It's pretty crazy

289
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,519
So once they figured out that is probably how Helen was doing

290
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:13,919
The most surprising piece of evidence that Helen was full of s*** was literally

291
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,015
Kool-Aid dye pill before performance

292
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Crystal clear

293
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
For some weird reason she was unable to produce ectoplasm that night mysterious

294
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Blood-stained look everybody

295
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,215
Still alive

296
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Seems imperative

297
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Wait till

298
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
Deed the spiritualist society

299
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
Believing in spiritualism or they like let's not do those spiritually

300
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
No Heroes here

301
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
They were like

302
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Hold on

303
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:07,679
Means that they're at least on the right side

304
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Well I was at Panera

305
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
What I am

306
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
I am far more believing

307
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,503
People who were like communicate to the others

308
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Cuz f******

309
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
Find there's multiple dimensions

310
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Is it. Then you start having to talk about

311
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Actual physics

312
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Like this is why ghosts don't exist

313
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
There would have to be a particle

314
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Something that can interact

315
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
But the physical world that's foolish close by manifestations Van that

316
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,711
Breaks all the laws of physics and every single scientist

317
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
Would descend upon you

318
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Is this even have the whip

319
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Obtrude

320
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
Well yeah I mean to some extent that's true

321
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,511
Because you can break the the simple law of matter cannot be created or

322
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,631
Destroy everything is out the window once this lady throws up the cheesecloth

323
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Hair world

324
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
This guy named I

325
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
The director of the National Laboratory of physical research

326
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
PayPal

327
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Right Use the sample of her ectoplasm

328
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
The definitively show that it was

329
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
This passage

330
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
Maybe one of my favorite things I've read about one of these tan people from Israel

331
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
On one of those

332
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
At the conclusion of the fourth seance

333
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
We led the medium to aesthetic

334
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
And I called for the apparatus

335
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
That's effective at the lady promptly went into a trance

336
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
She recovered but refused to be x-rayed

337
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Went up there and told her that it was pain

338
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,039
She jumped up and gave him a smashing blow to the face which sent him reeling

339
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
Is your husband as a woman in the in the 20th or the 30th but also

340
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
You can hit me up

341
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
Then she went for dr. William Brown who is present

342
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
You dodge the blow

343
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,551
Miss Duncan without the slightest warning dashed out into the street had an attack of Hysteria and began

344
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
What are bursae undergarment

345
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
She clutched the railings

346
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Scream scream

347
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
Her husband tried to pacifier it was useless

348
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
I leave the reader to visualize the scene

349
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
17 Stone woman

350
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
Lock to the railing screaming at the top of her voice

351
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Collected

352
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
And the police arrived

353
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
The medical men with us explained the position in preventative

354
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Prophetic an ambulance

355
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,103
We got back into the laboratory

356
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
To be x-rayed

357
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:00,479
In reply Dr William Brown turn to mr. Duncan and ask him to turn out his pocket

358
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
He refused and would not allow us to search up

359
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
There's no question that is why potassium the cheesecloth in the

360
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
However they gave us another

361
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Control

362
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
Piece of Tower Plaza one of the pier

363
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
Of half-a-dozen man each of the pair of scissors waiting for the word was amusing

364
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
It came and we all jump

365
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
One of the doctors got a hold of the stuff insecurities

366
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,639
The medium screamed in the rest of us and the rest of the telepathy

367
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
This time it wasn't

368
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
They proved to be paper soaked in egg white

369
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
And fold it into a flight into

370
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
Could anything be more infantile been a group of grown men

371
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,719
Wasting time money and energy on the antics of the email crook

372
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,327
So that's a little

373
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
That's a little rude

374
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
Admin

375
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,567
It's a very rude unnecessary but I was going to say when you said 17

376
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Also it did help

377
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,711
Though that he called her fat because I was like 17 Stone is that a lot or is that a little

378
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
These measures what's the BMI on Stone

379
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,671
Hubris

380
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
And the fact that immediately they knew that like oh yeah

381
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Some sort in order to

382
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
To cover for your like passing office

383
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
The evidence

384
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
So excuse me ma'am we have

385
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Seems light of hand before Soca

386
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Could you

387
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
Could you not yeah that one simple to call

388
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,895
T31 prices Report with

389
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
Was issued whereupon

390
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
I miss Mary

391
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
McKinley

392
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Came forward

393
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,575
Choose Miss Duncan personal made at the time of the seances

394
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
And she made a statutory declaration before commissioner votes

395
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
That you used to purchase

396
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
For Miss Duncan

397
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
She had to wash off before essay on

398
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,887
She also swore on oath that mr. Duncan on the night of the scene at the National Laboratory

399
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
That is why I said quote Pastor role of butter mucilin

400
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
To handle when they were alone

401
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:06,175
So that's confirmed her maid making a statement

402
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
I can't

403
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
Like without this being a visual show

404
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
I can't stress enough how comical

405
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
Pictures of her

406
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,680
Because there's just a length of cheesecloth coming out

407
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Like the pictures but that guy duet The Flash Photography they are just like those cheesecloth coming out of her mouth

408
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
How's that lead up

409
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
To like a big puppet

410
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Crazy how easy it was the clown people disappear 70 years ago at 81 years old

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Yeah

412
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Because a lot of

413
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
This is so heartless

414
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
For the most part you're just a scam

415
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
Doable people out of money for the seances

416
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
She was mostly left alone through most

417
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
That gossip

418
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,448
Better Business that you laid out about the HMS bar

419
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
Like that's that's really where she like

420
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,128
You stepped out of line even that she went to prison for less than a year

421
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,016
That's more of the government's fault than anybody else I don't I don't disagree with that at all

422
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,368
There was a research study done on how like keeping us

423
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,464
Secret and every person that you add with knowledge of that secret it like

424
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
Geometrically become more and more likely that the

425
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,608
Going to get out if you have the family members of 8

426
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
100 people

427
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,192
It's going to get out there's no

428
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,288
No way it doesn't get out I can't remember who it was exactly

429
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
It's not really relevant to the bigger story

430
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
But researchers who dug into did Vines

431
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Specific examples of

432
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
People who

433
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Admitted that they told you

434
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
We're just

435
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Guessing the people talked about it before with me public

436
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
It's not guessing

437
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,232
Information got out realize that I wasn't

438
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
Let's say you're the mother of one of the sailors

439
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Family members

440
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,336
Maybe the secondary relaying the information doesn't have a part about it

441
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Lendup

442
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
To substantiate that

443
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Into the ghost sailor

444
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
I was

445
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
She had like a p

446
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Piece of one of their hats

447
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
HMS Barham

448
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
The ships just at HMS

449
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,064
Years old like soldiers current uniform

450
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
In further like

451
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
More likely

452
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
So anyway

453
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
I mean she's a

454
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Just cheesecloth of course you can make a

455
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,424
Killer fraud woman in Lake

456
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
The 20s 30s

457
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
Pretty bad mouth

458
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,152
You know what it's like when they played baseball in the twenties the fastest fastball was like 70 miles an hour

459
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Drew

460
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,808
Throwing 70-mile she's throwing meatballs now but if she was f****** blowing

461
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,768
She did not allow black soap most likely like American baseball

462
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Speaking of bigotry

463
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
Resigned

464
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Came into the world

465
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Spirit

466
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
I'm a video

467
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
But I found

468
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Really

469
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Down the rabbit hole

470
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,104
David is coming

471
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
The three Bells

472
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
Before was much more like

473
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
You like lizards

474
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,024
About some stuff I've said that before like so much TV

475
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
But as we go along

476
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
I do think

477
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
That the things that I would like

478
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
Are so minimal compared to the bigger issues that we sort of look at

479
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
And the fact that like David Icke things

480
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,920
The protocols of the Elders of Zion is real

481
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,992
I think that I was remiss a little bit

482
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,184
That's not fair

483
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
One who woke up Paul Joseph Watson

484
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,048
He's the guy who woke up this dude can we not use that

485
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
Nobody should be allowed to talk about the Matrix

486
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
I'm calling a moratorium

487
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,384
We can use the red pill analogy

488
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
They were in The Matrix

489
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
Which is the least crazy

490
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:32,832
Simulation Theory

491
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:38,720
I can find the specifics on this way I feel like I can only relay this as like

492
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Secondhand dish

493
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
I can't

494
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,096
Spend all my time digging through all sorts of Messi

495
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
Boards but I did find a number of in

496
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Sentences of

497
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
People quoting

498
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Ben Jones

499
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Message boards

500
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Denying the hall a

501
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
Talk about

502
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
And like the gas Chambers were gas Chambers

503
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Why wouldn't you

504
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Inasmuch as

505
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
It follows

506
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
David Icke

507
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
Having beliefs

508
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,096
But I don't want to say it specifically cuz I can't find the original

509
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Reposting

510
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Of things that

511
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
You said to have posted

512
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Because might be real

513
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
Yeah but not enough that I can be like

514
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,384
I know you deny the Holocaust

515
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,760
It would work in a Civil Trial not a criminal trial

516
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,904
I ate so much that I'm not saying I agree with everything

517
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Line

518
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
Is touch the same thing that

519
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,352
Republicans do to like distance themselves from people that they totally off

520
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
They sat on

521
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
But it's like

522
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,032
Nazi running for congress in Illinois like Nazi

523
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,872
Republicans are like well I don't agree with everything you said isn't even like

524
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
Everything says

525
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
But

526
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,392
Do that sorta thing where you're like

527
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
I don't believe in everything he says which allows the brain

528
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
To be like you do believe

529
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
Explicitly tell me what you do

530
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Include

531
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
The global deniability

532
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
Weak ship

533
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Very very lame

534
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
We heard at the beginning of this episode Carrie

535
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
Was saying that

536
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
Who's involved the bond novel

537
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Corsage

538
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
You might

539
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Think after listen

540
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
This clip that

541
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
This is a house built on a foundation of sand

542
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,064
Around 4

543
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Ian Fleming James Bond

544
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Oh

545
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
It was Fleming

546
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,200
Who was involved basically in the D-Day

547
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Organization

548
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
So you already said there's no evidence

549
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,624
To Vapor say but their circumstances

550
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Connect to it

551
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,208
This next clip says more

552
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
That's not good

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
I don't know the name of this book I cannot read it

554
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,432
No I don't know the title of his book and I have it ready

555
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Riddle book

556
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Football books

557
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Universal knowledge

558
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,080
Actually is working on it right now

559
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
I want to watch that thing

560
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
Describes it as a stream-of-consciousness at 1

561
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,208
Filled with lies about a liar about a conference and who you're just taking it

562
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
Sweet face value

563
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
The Bible

564
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
This lady I absolutely haven't.

565
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Holden compulsion

566
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
There's no doubt about it

567
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
It's not but there's some reasons to be

568
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Vicious

569
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
About the circumstances

570
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,616
She was punished by the law cuz she said

571
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
No

572
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Cuz the influence

573
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Fleming

574
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,808
And put that aside

575
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
But it's so not important to the bigger picture of thing

576
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
There's the reason

577
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Be suspicious

578
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
I'm get to them here in the next question

579
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Yeah

580
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah that is

581
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
Which is really strange

582
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
If I were a judge

583
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
I would be like

584
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
How dare you

585
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
You want to do a seance in court how about you go fuc yourself

586
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Is not that easy

587
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,336
No place in court for a seance

588
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,408
The opposite of a seance

589
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
She could get in

590
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Trick

591
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
And now know existed

592
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
The other reason you run into

593
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Two issues that you

594
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
You open up a can of worms

595
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,984
Allow a whole lot of

596
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Yeah

597
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,664
Going to be like other half

598
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Maybe

599
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
What the judge

600
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Is setting the precedent

601
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
That sounds were real

602
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
And then

603
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
.

604
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
Admissible in court for Alta

605
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
Witchcraft law from the 1700s can be used to convict her now

606
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
Then so could seances be used to

607
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
When

608
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,984
It's like I don't I don't think there's any chance

609
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Nightmare scenario where

610
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,920
She gets off and the Seance

611
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
The situation where you could call ghost

612
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
2

613
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Also that was at the eclipse started right after he went in

614
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Be quiet

615
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
I got that is an option

616
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
Improving the cheese at Giant

617
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
There's an interesting

618
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Schism

619
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
What's going on on this episode

620
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
And it's very

621
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Because

622
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
So

623
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
Ben believes

624
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
About Winston Churchill

625
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,792
Kari he believes the Ian Fleming

626
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Behind all day

627
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,424
Terry believes that Ian Fleming is behind it but he was reporting to win

628
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Austin Churchill

629
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Directly

630
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
And so

631
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,848
Didn't know about the letter

632
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,432
To the prosecutors asking why what's going on with it

633
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,528
Yeah.

634
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
Baccano

635
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
She knows

636
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,976
The Churchill was involved with you but I have to say

637
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,328
In terms of my understanding is that Ian Fleming

638
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Recorded Church

639
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,008
And that that they were trying to hide D-Day and D-Day Trisha wasn't charged

640
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
And

641
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
JB it's a very old book

642
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,040
I don't know

643
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,904
I highly recommend it if you have it

644
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,744
Cuz it it really does reveal at Fleming's involvement

645
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Very deeply involved

646
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
In D-Day

647
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
OPG

648
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Nice abbreviation

649
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Operation

650
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Facebook

651
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
Has roundly

652
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,456
It's all you have to give her points for knowing and having red

653
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
It's almost clear

654
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
The publisher added a note to its

655
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Readers

656
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
To make their own judge

657
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
That's about what they believe

658
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
This book is a thrilling story from a remarkable man

659
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Cool

660
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
Say the same thing about everything Larry Nichols

661
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,800
Absolutely basically the underlying

662
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,360
Story of it has to do with the idea that Martin bormann

663
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
Did not die in Berlin in April 9th

664
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,456
1845

665
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
It was carried out to

666
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Flip and tell the British where all the

667
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
Because Martin bormann was involved in the

668
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Cuz of that the right

669
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,072
Replaced it with a look-alike who has been killed

670
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,312
Kind of hurt by an exclamation of borman's body

671
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Cuomo

672
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,944
Djb wood plane has to be a look alike

673
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Martin bormann

674
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,808
Until I hear from him

675
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:46,208
So now the new story is that that investigation and exclamation is a white watch

676
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Because it can't

677
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
You can't give up

678
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,656
You can't just give up believe in reality

679
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
It is that thing where you get trapped in a sort of logic

680
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Leave something

681
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
For no reason

682
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Because it's something you just want to believe in you

683
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
Then whenever counter-evidence comes to

684
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
Do you eat zoezi

685
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Blackout

686
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
F*** you man

687
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
You made the other leap literally every time I

688
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
All kinds of

689
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
It is actually

690
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,264
Coming out of her but it's like you know if you have a gun

691
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Without a bullet

692
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,664
Swap in order for it to come out as ectoplasm

693
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
Okay alright

694
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Sure

695
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,320
Only comes from

696
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
This would be a way that they couldn't reach cogently argued that very clear evidence that the ship

697
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
They're talkin about is fake or not

698
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Ignore the idea that like

699
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Well she was proven to be

700
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
Beacon person on a number of occasions

701
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,408
You start asking yourself questions and eventually you're going to find an answer and you like it

702
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,296
Paper mache mask on Willow

703
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Become a ghost

704
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
Become cheesecloth so

705
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
New red pill

706
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,976
We're not using red pill anymore we're saying they became chief

707
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
So

708
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
D

709
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Isaac

710
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
Everything is pretty

711
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
But they're going off on

712
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,496
I mean you know Ian Fleming was involved

713
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Intelligence

714
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
He's Able he's able to write

715
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
Bond so detailed and reportedly

716
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
Homophobic

717
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,256
Most of the villains

718
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:03,424
With p**** Glory I'm not going to lie to you I don't know if anybody

719
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
That name lot of bees

720
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,544
So I think there's a little bit of a

721
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Fitness

722
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
To the evidence so far

723
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:16,224
That means all

724
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,832
And it wasn't that bad

725
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Terry mentioning that book gets him to be like

726
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,232
Well maybe that's true which shows the depth of these people's conviction

727
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,072
This is exactly like whenever she f****** let the other guys like Alyssa

728
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
She's going to try and do that.

729
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
Because

730
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
She's got to pull into her bag of tricks

731
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
And pull out what I'm

732
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
Literally her only source

733
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,688
To say that the sort of

734
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Photonic

735
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
The Nazis

736
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
Many other things that we're going on during those times

737
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Of course I have other evidence

738
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,024
I've got a witness. Captain Mark Richards

739
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,096
To I interview I in prison

740
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
My right ear is his name

741
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,032
Yes.

742
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,152
Vayase have gone to the prison and interviewed him actually eight-time

743
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
Which of these me I would Trump's you knowing his wife

744
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
Assholes

745
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:29,696
So that means there might be one coming soon

746
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
Oh yeah

747
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
India

748
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
Of a Numark Richards episode

749
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Well she's trying to bring up Mark Richard

750
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
She brings up a new

751
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
Piece of information that I

752
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
True

753
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,568
She has family that were in Britain and

754
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Pacifica

755
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
The Dutchman

756
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Hell yeah

757
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,528
What you might say to a cult that he has a boy was going to parties on Churchill

758
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
And there was a heavy duty this is not widely known

759
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
As part of his work

760
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
Revealing.

761
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Churchill and

762
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
Members at that time

763
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
So Winston Churchill died in 90

764
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
55

765
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Went to parties

766
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
With

767
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
Winston Churchill

768
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
If

769
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,480
I don't remember how old Mark Richards

770
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
B-58

771
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
Hi to be alive

772
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
Yeah I think that's possible

773
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
He might be over 50

774
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Which means he's going to parties

775
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
Churchill's estate when Churchill is a year from death

776
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
I don't know about that

777
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Is Google's market

778
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Churchill

779
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
You don't think

780
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,711
Winston Churchill

781
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
And the Dutchman

782
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,087
Him from Winston Churchill when he died

783
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
So what he remembers

784
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Is actually

785
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
And idyllic

786
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,231
With his real father

787
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
Jason Churchill whom we all remember as a grape

788
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
And then the Dutch

789
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Stolen

790
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
I just

791
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,751
It's possible situation all over

792
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
To figure out Mark Richards

793
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
Sage here which is chopped

794
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
Or the conviction

795
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:34,111
Right and he was supposed to be like what 20 20 something in 1980

796
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,719
Tough for him to a party as a kid

797
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,863
Believe that

798
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727
Because if we point that out

799
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
He is at

800
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:56,127
Traveler

801
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,991
This is bulletproof logic

802
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
Also like if he party with you know

803
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
Winston Churchill with his dad

804
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
When he was a wee lad

805
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
Why was he running like a tire shop

806
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
When he committed that murder why was he

807
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Ended up cover

808
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
For his time traveling and off-world

809
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
If he if Minerva

810
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Was

811
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,639
The only way that you can hide a sentient spacecraft

812
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,991
Is if you run it cuz then people

813
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Spacecraft

814
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,623
Coming in and out of their true

815
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
Beyond credit

816
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
For me to accept

817
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
Space Program

818
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
Going on with offworld mission

819
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Is that the Dutch

820
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Save the world

821
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,519
We need to drop

822
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
I find it almost impossible

823
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
But that person would organize a murder for like five grand

824
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
It's very difficult for me to believe

825
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
But someone who is that

826
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
To the world

827
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
I would be in that kind of financial strain

828
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
He was framed and

829
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Brain

830
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
That one carries a big guy

831
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
We know that

832
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
She tosses Marc rich

833
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Just wants to impress these people and let them know.

834
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Slouch

835
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,287
Yeah she knows Mark Richard

836
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Personally

837
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,407
I really don't understand any of that

838
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,455
Any of this world at all

839
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,015
It's just on that we're even that guys like

840
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Yes I know his wife

841
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
No you should know

842
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:47,999
He's on the circuit doing these weird like awake and aware conferences The Very Organized

843
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Because these people

844
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
Is not good enough

845
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:58,495
If you just have a web show like Kerry Cassidy makes a lot of money from Project Camelot

846
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
Other people don't make much

847
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,615
On their shrimp

848
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Come together and

849
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
People

850
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
That's annoying

851
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
Autograph

852
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
Except for at least wrestlers did something real

853
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Bike which I mean

854
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
Perform fake stuff

855
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
More tragic

856
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Figures generally them

857
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Nissan people because

858
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
Right

859
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,431
So you see them now washed up and down on their luck and maybe

860
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
The pillows

861
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
Probably a lot like Margaret

862
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Drug trade

863
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
In prison

864
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,207
Compel

865
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
He was on

866
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,303
Speed and shake when he went in and maybe like

867
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
His brain just hasn't regulated

868
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,191
You know he's like an addict without a drug

869
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
Is addiction is Manifest by lying to

870
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
Sicario

871
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
Resources

872
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Next clip she accidentally brings up

873
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Another one

874
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Helen

875
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,367
Which they are very similar

876
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
This guy is someone who I

877
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Terry's interviewed of a bunch

878
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
The time I brought him up

879
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
If someone mentioned

880
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
In the

881
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Brought up

882
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
I've been putting off doing the full episode about him

883
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Cuz he is like

884
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,175
I would describe him as the big boss

885
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,991
Almost the big boss Mark Richards

886
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Is not difficult

887
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
To get to the bottom of

888
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
But like we know that

889
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
There's records

890
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
The rocky was really

891
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
The time of the murder and all this

892
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,839
It's not that hard to get around and his stuff

893
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Fun

894
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
He's talking about

895
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,495
Spacecraft wrap for chocolate Superfund

896
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
This guy

897
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
Sean David Morton

898
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Is

899
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
So

900
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Hardcore of a con man

901
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,271
He's not as fun but there's no Raptors that there is

902
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
There are aliens

903
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,855
And stuff like that but it's not as Whimsical and not as fun

904
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
So every time I've sat down to try it

905
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,719
Do an episode about him

906
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
Very hard

907
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
Because like I have to

908
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
So much b*******

909
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
In terms of

910
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
This is

911
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,751
Very difficult

912
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:43,615
Some of that will discuss the other end of this clip

913
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Pretty f******

914
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,479
Okay well there is another aspect

915
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
That I I do look at

916
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,439
Which has to do with Sean David Morton I know this is going to sound extraordinary but

917
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,743
Sean David Morton

918
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,559
Chicken has been proving this for many many years

919
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
And of course very public person and he got thrown in jail supposedly

920
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,543
For overstepping certain

921
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
Associate

922
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
Somebody that

923
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,527
And I was actually involved in

924
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,343
A group that and I lost money

925
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,975
But I didn't blame Sean because I know sort of the machinations what happened behind the scenes

926
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
And so on

927
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,607
But I have to say that there were people that did and I'm not sure whether that

928
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
Contributed to his theme

929
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
Things run in prison

930
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
But I do know that he's writing a book

931
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,895
That is just closing

932
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
Drew who was running

933
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,575
Area 51 who was running the scene here on planet Earth in terms of the Ichie

934
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:02,719
Situation and so on and that this this man is Story Goes that

935
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
There's a whistleblower who

936
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,119
Padgett lawyer give all his materials

937
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
Please turn this into fiction

938
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,775
No and don't reveal Who I Really Am

939
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,079
Sean wrote these three books called Sansa

940
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,151
Airtight airtight

941
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
Whistleblower right now

942
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Has been thrown in jail

943
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:36,255
Fascinating about all that is is is the link up with what happened to Helen

944
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Yes they are both

945
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
Fraud

946
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Ran afoul

947
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,703
Fraud laws

948
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Sean David Morton

949
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
Kerry Cassidy

950
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,847
According to her partner Bill Ryan

951
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
Carrie lost about a hundred

952
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
$16,000

953
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
Amazing

954
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
A major chunk of her mother's inheritance

955
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,183
Which helps support our living expenses in the start-up of Camelot

956
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
And I also lost 25

957
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Not a penny has ever been returned

958
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
It's a story that

959
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
Not been told

960
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Carrie likes

961
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
What he did was

962
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
Run afoul of some investment

963
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Applause

964
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
That's not the full story

965
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
Hear this from an article about them

966
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
Hermosa Beach residence

967
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,623
We're taking into custody yesterday after being indicted by a Federal grand jury on a host of charges related

968
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Scheme

969

To defraud the Internal Revenue Service

970

971
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Bogus checks

Cinnabons

973
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
Themselves and others

974
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Perfect

975
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
To the superseding indictment

976
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167

00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
M2010

979
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
It's not millions of dollars in refunds

980
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,359
Melissa Morton allegedly filed several false tax

981
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
The indictments

982
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,503
Specifically alleges that Sean David Morton file default 2006

983
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527

984
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
Requested

985
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343

634 dollars

00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
For 2000

993
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143

994
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
In relation to

995
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,239
The scheme dream big man

996
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:27,615
I love it in relation to the indictment alleges that Sean David Morton on multiple occasions

997
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
And submitted to the IRS document

998
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,223
She called quote coupon for set off settlement enclosure

999
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991

1001
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
$29,000

1002
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,975
673

1003
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,631
Fictitious financial instruments were purported Bond exchange for the refund

1004
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
They sought from the IRS Accord

1005
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
The indictment

1006
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Sean David Morton

1007
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Can you get away with this

1008
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,591
Cuz he claims he's quoting not a 14th Amendment status

1009
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,407
Is all Sovereign citizenship

1010
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,527
They believe that the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction of doubt

1011
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Until he was certain

1012
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Going court and be like yeah I did that

1013
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
I'm just trying to get my money back that the government

1014
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Sovereign Silver

1015
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Believe that

1016
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
Tyler gold

1017
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,839
Are we are we are

1018
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631

1019
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,703
And file the right document government

1020
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,287
To give you that money that they have an

1021
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
That's for all of us are

1022
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,967
Human person right or corporate

1023
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,551
Just say the right things the government like

1024
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
Have to give you the gold

1025
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Jesus

1026
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
Do an elaborate Financial

1027
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Claims this

1028
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
I assume sort of like reason why he did it

1029
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
Sea-Monkeys not a criminal

1030
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
He's actually

1031
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
The truth

1032
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
I knew he'd get in trouble

1033
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
This is all this is over

1034
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
Is he still in prison

1035
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,407
How long does it take for a while

1036
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:11,551
Wonder if you have to go interview him in prison

1037
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,855
Piece of gold that he wishes the government had given

1038
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
Absolutely

1039
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
So

1040
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,791
This is an interesting thing we had

1041
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Has 116,000 f****** dollars

1042
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,495
At least give up on

1043
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
That guy

1044
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,847
You can still believe in everything else but let that

1045
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
Kygo

1046
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,711
Yeah

1047
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
Description of how they lost

1048
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
The money

1049
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
Claims that it wasn't

1050
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
Wrongdoing by Sean

1051
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
David Morton

1052
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:52,767
It was negligence on his part that led to them losing all that money

1053
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
The story that is

1054
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Not

1055
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
Telling but

1056
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
At the same time

1057
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
How to talk yourself into not blaming

1058
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
You f******

1059
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
You look into

1060
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
To the other X

1061
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
Auricular is that he was up to

1062
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Oh

1063
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
This guy is not a guy who's Act

1064
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Is a person who is

1065
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,479
Operating

1066
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
Very illegal

1067
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
But psychic

1068
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
So now

1069
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
Mark Richards

1070
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,695
Where Sean David Morton who's also in prison

1071
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
Both of them both very credible

1072
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Now

1073
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
This

1074
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Revelation

1075
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
From Ben

1076
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,911
But this thought

1077
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,775
Prison for a walk prison but

1078
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
This part is something that he should

1079
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
To do a little more examination

1080
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,735
Phone situation

1081
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
222

1082
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Somehow end up in jail

1083
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,423
It's generally fraud because I was a murder

1084
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,543
Probably committed

1085
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
We're all comment why do we keep ending up in prison

1086
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,975
To do the next step on this almost like lying to people and then taking their money

1087
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
To be involved

1088
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
Sure deregulation of liars

1089
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
If you want to make. Org

1090
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
That's more

1091
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Next track

1092
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
Good this is Pizza Hut

1093
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
It depends on what class you were in

1094
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
Regulator

1095
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,015
This is the pathetic angle

1096
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Do not

1097
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
You know like

1098
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:00,511
The better question

1099
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
It's like the government is really again

1100
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
What's the topics that we cover

1101
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Why was

1102
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
Parks in elected office

1103
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
Why why is he not in prison

1104
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
I'm sure she would make the argument

1105
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,103
Popular I'm too famous for them to take me down

1106
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,455
That's where things like I live in public and that's why they can't get me

1107
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
She has been

1108
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,111
Prison if their narrative was true yet

1109
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,951
Specific people who go to prison

1110
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
Million-dollar

1111
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
Cuz he filed the paperwork he would be a hero b

00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,103
Write a book about aliens

1113
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
Pretend your whistle

1114
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
Blower

1115
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
No one cares

1116
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:56,319
Defraud millions of dollars for the government

1117
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
We're going to start tearing

1118
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,207
What they are not connecting

1119
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,535
Which is a bummer for the

1120
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
Please answer if their narratives are true

1121
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Is not that they are too

1122
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
Popular

1123
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
It's the exact

1124
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:18,079
No one's listening only going like they're only going after the people

1125
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
Who are players in the game

1126
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,407
Which means you guys

1127
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,991
Nothing Terry Cassidy probably more

1128
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,783
Notable in this world than Sean

1129
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
If you know that world

1130
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,719
He's a major player in

1131
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Conspiracy

1132
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:44,191
Where he went on the boat.

1133
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,615

00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,015
Excuse about doctor arrested by federal

1136
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
Hilarious

1137
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
Psycho

1138
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
So good

1139
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,695
So earlier you were

1140
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,719
Suggesting

1141
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
Influence the narrative

1142
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,327
She did with Eddie page

1143
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,191
The cock of the alien world

1144
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
Everything

1145
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,455
Yeah he allowed carry to walk him down a path

1146
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
What is narrative

1147
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
And

1148
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
You know what

1149
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,647
I don't I don't know if we just missed her doing that in the

1150
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
With other gas

1151
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,999
But she does

1152
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Whenever she's

1153
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:46,399
Whenever we're doing a mark Richards episode

1154
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,959
Now that's why I

1155
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:53,311
We find out she's the evil mastermind behind all of this s*** that's why we suspected that she

1156
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:59,967
Sweden microchip

1157
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Episode

1158
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
It might have been the first steps

1159
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
Super soldier

1160
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:11,487
Space Traveler.

1161
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
Notice it more but I didn't

1162
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,959
Terry was leaving

1163
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:26,591
In full control of a narrative

1164
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
Is soft

1165
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,503
Now it's interesting what happens here with this Ben Jones

1166
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Character

1167
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
Tries that

1168
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
And it doesn't really work

1169
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
You can see

1170
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
You can see

1171
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
Benz

1172
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Sing

1173
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
I'm in Cary

1174
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Wheatley take it

1175
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
Try and mold it in

1176
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
She wants it to be

1177
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
I am we'll see what happens

1178
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,959
No Inn in your case

1179
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Maybe I misunderstood when you were

1180
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Talking about

1181
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:04,479
In in the documentary but I got the impression that you actually

1182
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,295
Not to pursue the story

1183
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
By other p

1184
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:13,695
In your life like at the time when you were thinking about

1185
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
Pursuing it or something

1186
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,535
Not true

1187
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,327
Somebody

1188
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
This is something

1189
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Chicken bowls

1190
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,759
Responsible

1191
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,831
Exactly what someone might have said to me when I started this

1192
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:47,231
I don't know Dan

1193
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,327
Someone threatened

1194
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
You're warning me

1195
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Maybe

1196
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:00,799
He has a job you notice Porter

1197
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
So I don't know what that means

1198
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,711
We have a surprise

1199
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
We had a

1200
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
Custodian dishwasher for NASA

1201
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,879
Recently show up on Keurig

1202
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,439
Hospital Porter

1203
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
Which is

1204
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Variable what a porter could

1205
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,071
It could be a nurse's assistant

1206
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,863
It could be a nurse's assistant or it could be

1207
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
It could be anywhere either Realm

1208
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Hospital

1209
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,495
So he's just a guy who works at the hospital and he's

1210
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
Got a night game

1211
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,383
Write to another orderly at the hospital

1212
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Nothing like that

1213
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
I don't know

1214
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
Seems like

1215
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,599
But here's what he responds to that very benign

1216
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,159
Threatened I was born

1217
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:57,375
It is it is to me

1218
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,447
Because it's so interesting

1219
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,775
Interest me because it's so many years later

1220
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
That they wouldn't want to reveal this

1221
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,383
Which of course makes me all the more interest

1222
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
She's already trained

1223
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,551
What he is

1224
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
There's already moved the goalposts

1225
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Within like

1226
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,023
Because again the parallels to our time

1227
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,583
Answer the way they also stigmatized

1228
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,375
Conspiracy theorist

1229
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,447
So now she's trying to argue that Sean David Morton

1230
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Because of

1231
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,751
Parallels with

1232
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:40,639
When she's lying about the story and lying about what happened when Ben decided which is why

1233
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
She had him

1234
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
The first most

1235
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
As being there trying to class

1236
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
That person is being crazy

1237
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,135
They've actually

1238
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Timcast

1239
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,535
Apparently on some of us and found out that we have higher

1240
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,655
People out there.

1241
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
You know kind

1242
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,727
Allay any soda

1243
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,799
Skepticism

1244
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Now

1245
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
Allow for this kind of

1246
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Perception

1247
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,743
Certainly not mediumship question is very important

1248
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
Aspect

1249
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,655
Screws but in terms of

1250
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Your own

1251
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
Sort of trajectory

1252
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
So you were warned

1253
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,847
Slightly embarrassed way against

1254
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
Doing this but you continue to pursue it

1255
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
People search

1256
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
So he's not budging.

1257
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
Already coming a little bit

1258
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
Layoffs in business

1259
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
I don't know how much I like the evil mastermind

1260
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
I'm not

1261
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,415
Know whatever she was just so but willing to believe everything

1262
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
And now this is Alex's an idiot

1263
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,727
White nationalism

1264
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,567
Yeah so once you see the real picture of the

1265
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
People the face drops

1266
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
You start to get abs

1267
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
The games are playing

1268
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,759
More sinister

1269
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Patrolling the

1270
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
Meredith

1271
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
We like to imagine

1272
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
She's not a reporter

1273
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
She's writing a book in real time

1274
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
I'm forcing other weirdos

1275
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,559
100-percent that's the perfect metaphor

1276
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
So

1277
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
I didn't even hear about this earlier

1278
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
But

1279
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
Did Helen Duncan

1280
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Granddaughter

1281
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,567
Was going to call in

1282
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
The medium

1283
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,687
Jersey

1284
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,271
That would be way better for her granddaughter away for her granddaughter to call it

1285
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
Still with Bruce at to me

1286
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
But

1287
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
So

1288
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
Helen

1289
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Duncan

1290
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
H2h

1291
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,951
Cheesecloth madam

1292
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
Oh yeah

1293
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,511
Her granddaughter calls in

1294
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
And this is not

1295
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,375
This show

1296
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
But boy howdy

1297
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
This

1298
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
Is wild

1299
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
We are going to start

1300
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,847
How to connect

1301
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:55,967
That could not possibly be a mansion so here he is just a beginning

1302
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,319
The granddaughter calling in

1303
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Her name is Maggie

1304
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Because

1305
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Makes me think

1306
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Colin Hay song

1307
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
Straight Talk

1308
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,071
Hi Maggie how are you

1309
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,799
Yes you're on on on the show hear your voices

1310
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,127
Hi magazine

1311
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
I guess I can't watch

1312
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,927
If you try to watch

1313
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:41,023
It's Justice probably better if you don't but you can watch later

1314
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
I like

1315
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
See how you did

1316
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
What am I to do

1317
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,847
Memory are again

1318
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,151
She has nothing to say you just

1319
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
I'm starting to

1320
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:08,927
Some feedback people are liking whenever I start talking music

1321
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
I feel like I should talk a little more about Maggie

1322
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
Great song

1323
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,887
Makes me tear up Alright Alright song

1324
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,191
Look this is not a Dan reviews music

1325
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Alright

1326
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Alright

1327
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,151
This dude has

1328
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
Talk stoop

1329
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
To her granddaughter

1330
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
Of course

1331
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
So

1332
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:39,135
That's why we're good I just didn't know I thought it was thought it was going to be

1333
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Call the

1334
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
Obviously that's a stupid

1335
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:49,119
Did not cross my mind the only family

1336
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,191
Remember or any person involved

1337
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
In contact with

1338
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
So

1339
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Tell you what

1340
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871
That's not the only

1341
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
On the show

1342
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,735
I don't know how to set up this clip

1343
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,039
It's one of the weirdest things I've ever

1344
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,343
It is a long clip but Mike down

1345
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Weird

1346
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
This Is War

1347
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,439
Here

1348
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
This is

1349
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,767
This is insane backstory

1350
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Question

1351
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,887
No we had

1352
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,679
Veal at the end of this clip

1353
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,495
That is unbelievable

1354
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
A couple of things

1355
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
That are

1356
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
Deeply problematic

1357
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,407
It also makes it also makes

1358
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
The story of Helen dump

1359
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,551
Still much more robot doesn't want to go there okay

1360
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,159
And I would just want it I was just saying that that could you

1361
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
Explain how you got

1362
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:51,327
Reconnected with Eddie page was because you're still in touch with your grandmother is that right

1363
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Alright

1364
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,055
Research my grandmother

1365
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
My grandmother

1366
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,711
19

1367
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,271
I got to come in real quick

1368
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,879
The argument that people have is that

1369
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
King was killed

1370
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Because the p

1371
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Police raided one

1372
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
Promise

1373
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Rock-a-Doodle

1374
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,071
She's not doing it again on the low

1375
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
She's calling people in a

1376
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
Rum and so the argument goes.

1377
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
Because she was interrupted in

1378
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
In the middle of a train

1379
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
When she was getting ectoplasm out

1380
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
Debbie ectoplasm

1381
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Burned her

1382
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Bennett College

1383
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,271
Like exactly ended up dying

1384
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,087
Months later because of it

1385
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,879
Perfect this is horseshit

1386
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,439
Choosy as we already noted that that

1387
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,767
Review of 1%

1388
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:59,167
Unhealthy woman it was the 20s

1389
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:03,007
History of heart

1390
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
More like being interrupted

1391
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,671
Interfere with someone in the middle of vomiting up

1392
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Cheesecloth

1393
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
Epic card

1394
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,959
So I stayed away from this

1395
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,639
Nothing

1396
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,183
My grandmother

1397
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
I don't believe that

1398
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Egyptian gods

1399
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,607
Found it

1400
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Appleton Museum

1401
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,383
My grandmother

1402
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
Grandmother

1403
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Cheese Apple

1404
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,247
While she also a racist

1405
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,527
Baby

1406
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
Responsible for

1407
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,879
Responsible for some reason

1408
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,903
Can you believe this

1409
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
His backstory

1410
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,487
He's amazingly

1411
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,511
Helen Duncan

1412
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:09,631
This crazy con woman fraud from the 20s

1413
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
Speed Run 4

1414
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,495
Ends up accidentally running into any page

1415
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:20,895
The two of them together AV crazy together and then

1416
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
She ends up

1417
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,479
Hooking up Kerry Cassidy with Eddie

1418
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:28,575
Resulting in the episodes we went over it

1419
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Big old racist alien

1420
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Then comes on

1421
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,207
Deer in the episode about Helen Duncan and review

1422
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
She's an idiot

1423
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
It's crazy

1424
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
So happy

1425
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,735
You cannot do better

1426
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:01,087
Of all the crazy things that I know could have happened

1427
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,671
Because there's no end of the possibilities

1428
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,839
Who is The Bluest of the Blue Sky Thinking that would never have shown up

1429
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,447
Of course the granddaughter of a con woman is also a plea 80

1430
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
Exactly

1431
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
I mean

1432
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
There's no way to know when it started in the bar

1433
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:37,439
10 or 11 inexistent no no no no no there's a bunch of

1434
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
But not his brothers

1435
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,791
Sisters

1436
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
I call him my brother

1437
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,887
Cuz they're both

1438
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,191
Suggested maybe she's one of the

1439
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,287
From his 10 or 11.

1440
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,335
Even according to Eddie there's more pleiadian

1441
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
Adjust those alive

1442
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
Or whatever

1443
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Okay

1444
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
So

1445
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,247
First first class

1446
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,831
How do you spend 30 years researching Helen Duncan

1447
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,415
Even an hour to look at you like

1448
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
Refuse to

1449
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
That's better anyway amount of research necessary

1450
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
Only looking for research that prove she's a real

1451
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,519
It's going to take 30 years to get anything

1452
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,871
You're going to run to

1453
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,967
Weird-ass document

1454
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,527
After you've encouraged a racist to call himself a

1455
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Pleiadians

1456
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
And then

1457
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,623
No cuz then you know what happened

1458
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
You know what happen

1459
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
She was

1460
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,447
Holy s*** you're pleiadian to

1461
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
Yes exactly what happened

1462
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:06,015
Corner

1463
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
You limp noodle open

1464
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,439
He's weak as f*** so then he calls her and she's crazy

1465
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:19,071
She's somehow also been conned by your dead grandmother

1466
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:25,983
Gross so far three and they're all on this

1467
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,055
You might just be a gifted opportunity

1468
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,687
Getting reception already I thought it was really funny

1469
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
As I listen to it

1470
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
They are

1471
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,295
So incredulous

1472
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
And just alike

1473
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,487
Despite all evidence to the contrary they believe they believe in this magical

1474
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Towards the end

1475
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
And I heard that I was like

1476
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
That's amazing

1477
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,287
In our world

1478
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
Wonder

1479
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
Under so much about

1480
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:13,087
You know I don't believe I don't necessarily believe that there's something magical about

1481
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
Like really weird

1482
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,975
But he wasn't like some sort of conference

1483
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
He's pretty weird

1484
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,327
Does any page does have videos of himself

1485
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,631
I'm back in like the nineties and hypnotic regression

1486
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,543
He's been around for awhile

1487
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Just enough

1488
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Evidence

1489
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
From the

1490
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,807
Sarah is not really used yet

1491
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,135
And of the granddaughter of a famous con woman

1492
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,183
Would end up meeting each other in

1493
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,975
England

1494
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,767
They should be married

1495
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,303
There's no doubt the worst

1496
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,095
Children

1497
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
Be so dumb

1498
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,703
Biggest Liars joke

1499
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
It's awesome

1500
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,799
Here's the movie Pitch

1501
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,615
We find out

1502
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:12,223
That the granddaughter of let's go with matahari

1503
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
Alright

1504
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
Granddaughter of Mata Hari

1505
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
Falls in love

1506
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
With the grandson

1507
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,135
Of Ian Fleming

1508
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,951
It turns out that both of them

1509
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Are simultaneous

1510
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
Police spying on

1511
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Each other

1512
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
No I think I just wrote mr.

1513
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:32,703
We could remake that soak up a lot of celebrities who are really hot to get together

1514
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,895
True lover intellectual property

1515
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,431
Great intellectual

1516
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Much like

1517
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,551
Hey you want to make mr. and mrs. Smith together

1518
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,159
We might be sitting here and saying like

1519
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Told her that she's

1520
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
Two-player games

1521
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,815
But unfortunately it's not

1522
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
There's proof

1523
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Right

1524
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:30,559
Alright

1525
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,375
One we're talking about Helen Duncan

1526
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Not you

1527
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
Man it's awesome

1528
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
This is like

1529
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
I

1530
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
I love the way

1531
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
You listened to this show

1532
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
Of this Project Camelot episode

1533
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,295
You just hear stray names and not really know so much but

1534
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Because we've started covering a bunch.

1535
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,135
There's so much Robux

1536
01:19:55,391 --> 01:20:01,535
What's going on

1537
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,815
Each other up

1538
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,375
No

1539
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
We all know we're lying

1540
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,239
We're not going to call each other on this fair and very

1541
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Clearly

1542
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,311
Themes

1543
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
That is

1544
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Oh it's

1545
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,808
Houses on iron

1546
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,464
Alright because Iron Man popularized the Marvel Universe

1547
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,768
This is all Iron Man's fault

1548
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,072
I'm going to believe Iron Man for this

1549
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,352
DC Project Camelot

1550
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
Yeah but I don't care

1551
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,192
Free dating

1552
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
Yeah but they haven't

1553
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:47,104
Cinematic

1554
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,504
That's what I'm talkin about

1555
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:59,904
Right that's exactly right

1556
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,304
I did not even consider it I also get a month

1557
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
Perhaps

1558
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
Superman

1559
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,736
I love the snow

1560
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,272
I love this

1561
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,856
No steak

1562
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Sing about

1563
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,952
Unfortunately found a couple of likes fairly heavy

1564
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Episodes

1565
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:41,120
Jim Bakker like with

1566
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,728
So that's not even much of a regret

1567
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,520
Necessarily from the world but like

1568
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Getting a

1569
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,128
Getting a juicy episode of Project Camelot

1570
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Sweetest apple

1571
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,968
It's been just such a delight there's no steak

1572
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,600
It's just a walk in the park laughing at weirdos

1573
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:07,232
Did braces until proven otherwise have implications of her facilitating

1574
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792
So that's it.

1575
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
If you're prepping up racist

1576
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,704
Then you at the very least sympathize with

1577
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
In a way that's condemned

1578
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,920
Find no evidence from this episode the papers

1579
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
That like Howland

1580
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
No evidence

1581
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
In Fleming was even

1582
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
McKay's

1583
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
No evidence

1584
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Churchill

1585
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
No evidence

1586
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,208
She had any real gift that worked

1587
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
Is a hand or weird

1588
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,560
Conn's like throwing soda

1589
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
All this stuff is

1590
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
This awesome remnant

1591
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
The past not to discount

1592
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
I'm pulling it off

1593
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Put on her

1594
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,944
That's worthy of a documentary freezing I agree with you I think

1595
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
I don't know man

1596
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
Cuz I

1597
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
Really high

1598
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Cunning

1599
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,696
That sort of thing

1600
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
Cunning I would say

1601
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
More than any

1602
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,304
I think you hunting and creativity

1603
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
I always

1604
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,632
Cleverness is kind of a part of

1605
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
Yeah I think it's a form of

1606
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,496
It's a lawgiver like

1607
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,264
She's haifeng

1608
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
Live like that

1609
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,016
I dyed my hair

1610
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,112
I am living the life

1611
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Entire

1612
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Work

1613
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,696
Is dedicated to laugh

1614
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,536
So it's difficult for me to be like

1615
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,840
Just because it was a woman in the 90

1616
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
T29

1617
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,192
It doesn't really work

1618
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,984
For me as much as I want

1619
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,544
You know beat Super into like

1620
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
Elevating class

1621
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
Piano classes

1622
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,736
Group

1623
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Because Italy

1624
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Broad

1625
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,624
You know what I don't know

1626
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,904
What I want to know

1627
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Is a

1628
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,464
Detailed list of her client

1629
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,864
Because if she's Robin Hood and if she's only defrosting a no

1630
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,936
Ladies I'm fine with that but if she's a regular

1631
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
Michigan

1632
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
I'm pretty positive

1633
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
From everything I looked into

1634
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
Very normal

1635
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,688
I want I want the Robinhood

1636
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,272
That's what I want I want her to go around to like

1637
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,368
Kerry Cassidy it's like wow

1638
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,184
Buffalo State

1639
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,000
You one good turn deserves

1640
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
You losing $113,000

1641
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,608
Bitter fruit

1642
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,984
That's why that's how it works

1643
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,568
I don't know if we come away with any larger

1644
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:10,016
If you like the show please do check out our website

1645

On Facebook

1649
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448

Join the group

1652
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:34,592
I don't know how to say this without being really blunt about it

1653
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,360
But like

1654
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,152
The ways Facebook work

1655
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
If I post

1656
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
Something to the group

1657
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,016
30 of our fans will see

1658
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
Or something like that unless

1659
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
I pay them

1660
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
To promote

1661
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
In the group

1662
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
Everyone sees

1663
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,440
It works just

1664
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,512
Separately the way things go

1665
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,792
Tribute distributor

1666
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
In the group

1667
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
People sleeping

1668
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,400
So if you actually want to keep up with the show

1669
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,448
The group go home and tell your mother you're broiling

1670
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Our Facebook page

1671
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,544
Is largely inactive

1672
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Inert

1673
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,592
Cuz it bums me out

1674
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
Really hard

1675
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
When

1676
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
No one sees any of the ships

1677
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
Just never post anything on there

1678
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,272
It's kind of a dead

1679
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,552
The group

1680
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
Where all the apps

1681
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,112
Convey

1682
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,160
It is a private group but if you request

1683
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
To join

1684
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
Just lucky

1685
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,048
And that's a message

1686
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,168
Although you're still under suspension so give me a shout

1687
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,216
Moderator

1688
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,616
Okay if you want to email the message.

1689
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,896
And all of this s*** like

1690
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,712
10 million f****** journalist

1691
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:48,064
The first time a couple times but that's well no one gives a s***

1692
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
So many

1693
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
So many

1694
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,928
So many no answers like even when I was

1695
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,720
Even I was trying to

1696
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,768
We're not in

1697
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,560
0 notes from

1698
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
And I was talking about with this

1699
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,168
Burrows came over the other night

1700
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
He'd left in the

1701
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
House

1702
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,336
He was asking how things are going but no one cares

1703
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,456
Absolutely recent messages

1704
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
People in it

1705
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,088
It makes sense

1706
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
This is a crazy

1707
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
There's no reason

1708
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
Could we actually looking

1709
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,792

Man these guys are probably crazy probably weirdos

1714
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,128
Differing of

1715
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,712
Philosophy more by this to end like

1716
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:54,112
Whenever I used to try and get published as a as a writer whenever I was like 1920 and I was sending out

1717
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,648
All of the short story

1718
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,952
At least I will get a rejection letter

1719
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,512
Yeah yeah

1720
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,072
Bother all the people that I've messaged

1721
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096

1722
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:10,496

1723
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264

1725
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,200
Send a message to crazy

DIY

1727
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Okay

1728
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:28,160
Richard supporting the show

1729
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,208
Did I feel very

1730
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,256
Turn about it like

1731
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Like the emotion

1732
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
Sensation

1733
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
Of it is like

1734
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,168
When I used to run comedy shows and I send out press releases

1735
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,472
Whatever

1736
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
Whatever I didn't get a response

1737
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:48,128
This is like the event page of Metro mixer Joe the reader

1738
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,944
Every goddamn comedy shows probably sending them

1739
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,272
Boilerplate trash

1740
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Respond

1741
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
It feels different now because

1742
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
I know it's probably not

1743
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Springfield purse

1744
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
It feels like they say

1745
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
I think we're crazy

1746
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,000
Bethany is such a bummer like

1747
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
Like engaged

1748
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
The tiny bit with what

1749
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,376
Like what we're trying to bring to the table

1750
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,912
Do you like no we're not

1751
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,680
People who think that

1752
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:15,008
He works for Israel

1753
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,544
Go down the dump

1754
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,616
Chris Brown help

1755
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,200
You know it's actually is

1756
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Consider that an

1757
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,552
I always thought I'd like it legit

1758
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,344
Responding because

1759
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
They're not interested

1760
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:37,024
It never occurred to me that they're not responding because anybody who message them about Alex Jones

1761
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,424
Of course they're not responding it's absolute nevermind I congratulate

1762
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,728
Listen to everybody who has not responded

1763
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,312
You have learned your lesson well unfortunately you missed the boat

1764
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,016
Some other thought but

1765
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,576
Some people have pointed out that Kelly

1766
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,600
Alex's ex-wife

1767
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
Has been on

1768
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
A bunch of shows lately

1769
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:08,512
Stuttering John podcast

1770
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
That's not what I'm talkin

1771
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,912
Implications of like

1772
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,448
She's been on a lot of shows

1773
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
You come on yours

1774
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,008
No

1775
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,312
I want to be clear without saying anything

1776
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,360
Specific or anything

1777
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,176
She would have come on our show

1778
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
Good for either

1779
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,040
We never were really in

1780
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,576
Like a close contact

1781
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
But

1782
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,672
I know for sure she would have come on our show

1783
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,232
And I'd I made an executive decision that

1784
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
It wasn't good

1785
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,072
It wasn't good for her.

1786
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,888
The cheese trying to achieve I would never talk.

1787
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,936
Yeah, Moto

1788
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,752
Open

1789
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:55,104
I think we got a

1790
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,896
If you're out there

1791
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:01,760
Get me home

1792
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:06,368
No reason that we can think of nevermind

1793
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
See if you can find out

1794
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,488
Jordan has been a lot of fun this has been a lot of

1795
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792

It's on you

1799
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,288
I would say to the guy who

1800
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
Cruise

1801
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,384
Yeah but I'm really hoping that he's going to

1802
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,688
Put that second cruise together and call it be

1803
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,760
I do like that name

1804
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,368
We laughed I don't want I don't want to ruin that possibility if he hears about this

1805
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,416
You not going to take my idea to make

1806
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Make a mediumship

1807
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Offended that I don't

1808

Super large

1809
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,960
Forget the result

1810
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,544
What's up where the middle

1811
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,824
