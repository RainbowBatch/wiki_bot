1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra first in color with huge fan of your work.

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,848
Sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,664
Jones

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,552
Something to do with my matinee Idol good looks

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
I know a lot about Alex is delightfully fun for people

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
Isolate

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
And this is the first time I've ever said man

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
This water is garbage

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,032
Garbage water say that about my good friends over at ice mount

10
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
I like the Ice Mountain line of sparkling water

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
Because there is a tartan

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,504
There's no sweetness like a lot of these other fizzy Waters

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
It's just a straight-up

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Water

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
Straight up water

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
European

17
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
And that's why you are dumb

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
Jordan I've got a really fun show playing that for you here tonight for you and the listeners

19
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
Defeating the entire purpose

20
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
The show for me to know any

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,040
About

22
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
Can't wait

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
Sometimes I stumble

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
Whenever I hadn't seen the movie Moana

25
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Can you just would not let up about

26
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Never happen

27
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Supper for me

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
Sometimes the stars align

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
In such a way

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
That I know this

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
Something along the way here is going to blow your f****** mind

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
It's going to be.

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay I am just very excited to bring that to you but first couple of new daughters on the podcast

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
First Electric

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
I'm a policy wonk

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
Congratulations

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
It's not April O'Neil from Ninja Turtles

38
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
I was going to make

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
Review

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
April Ludgate from Parks and Recreation

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Define Farrah.

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,896
I also like to give a shout out to Mike. Thank you so much for joining up

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
If you'd like to come aboard Mighty or as I would call you April O'Neil

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
Very elaborate

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Knowledge fight.com

46
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
And helping us keep this going we appreciate everyone who donates so

47
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Amazingly much

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,496
It's absurd to level of support

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
Interesting people reaching out to us makes this all its cradle possible as opposed to you and I

50
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Losing our minds

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
I'm talking about this dumbass hole in Texas

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Anybody listening

53
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
Like when we first started this I think it was going to be like

54
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
And what happened

55
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
Do that

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Nice

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
T just s***

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Crazy

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
It's not

60
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Check back in with Alex Jones post-marathon

61
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Of course because over the weekend

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
He was lying about YouTube shutting down his channel

63
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,112
Is accounted been Frozen and YouTube.

64
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Videos of

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Which kind of flew in the face of the idea that he was frozen

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
BuzzFeed reached out to YouTube and apps penny that was true and they said shut up

67
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,704
End

68
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:58,336
And I realized I realized the reason why is it because

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
He didn't make enough money at the marathon

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Needs to really

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Get people excited

72
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
The fear back in them

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
So I checked I looked at the

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Ashok you're on Monday as we're recording

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
On Monday

76
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
And

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Owen Shroyer without a lawyer

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
There's nothing here

79
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Sunday's child

80
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Refund

81
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
His lawyers

82
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
For real you did this s*** I don't know how to help

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Pronounce just

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
It's the timer is that

85
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
I want to be there

86
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
You're screwed

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
Whiskey

88
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
That'll work

89
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
Watch Sunday it was really boring

90
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Goddamn is nothing we can do

91
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
I guess I could go back to

92
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
Time travel episode

93
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Which was September 1st

94
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Until I went back never forget

95
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
September 1st

96
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
2012 13 and 14 I'm sorry 13 14 and 15 we're all best of shows

97
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Jesus

98
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Put packages

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
He's doing clips

100
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,863
Yeah basically it's nuts

101
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
September 1st on a food that I had in front of me we're all untenable as I can

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Do a f****** clip show

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
But one of the clip shows

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Included his interview with Russell Brand

105
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Here we go

106
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
That can't

107
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
It's going to be great

108
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
He's a dumbass New Age Guru or whatever it was it was just boring

109
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Really boring interview

110
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
There's some comedy in the fact

111
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Exit like

112
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Russell Brand is pushing

113
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
A revolution

114
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
And when asked what his Revolution

115
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Oud galuteria socialist

116
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
Alex

117
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
There's some comedy to that but I realized it wasn't f****** worth

118
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
So I started looking

119
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Is Russell Brand

120
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
I know that his Booky wook

121
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
Is a great literature

122
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
No I don't know a couple things from Russell Brand

123
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Past

124
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
But I don't think he's great

125
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,567
He's not terrible I guess and here's the one thing I do want to say for all of like his

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
Overly scarf

127
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
5

128
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
Words like people who live in Beverly Hills and are worth 15 million dollars talking about Revolution

129
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
Posh lifestyle Drive

130
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
For all of that

131
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Stuff that is valid criticism of him

132
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
Certain very annoying

133
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,135
He's not somebody if you look at his actual life in his actual career

134
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
He's not somebody who's just been all lip serve

135
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Cuz he's really active in like

136
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Union fundraising and stuff like that

137
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Even trying to help people

138
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
And stuff like that

139
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
You can't take that away from

140
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
And I won't

141
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,263
And the fact that he grew up in was a horrible drug addict

142
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
And then has been trying to

143
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
People to

144
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Deal with drug addiction as a disease

145
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,087
I tried to take that more seriously I think there's a lot to respect there even if you did

146
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
Doing all right

147
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
Even bright

148
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,679
Give me the poor ones who can't say anything and no one will listen to them

149
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,799
Just getting the job done he does a lot to help people and isn't all talk

150
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
But

151
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
He wrote a book called mybookie

152
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
S'more

153
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
I got to find another fuc

154
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Celebrity interview

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
I got one of these it's got to be good

156
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
So then I listen to his interview with Jonathan Davis

157
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Yes

158
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Alright one there's a guy in corn name

159
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
Jonathan Davis

160
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,407
J devil this didn't come up in the interview

161
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Irrelevant Alex

162
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
That's got to be the only thing

163
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Yes I am the devil

164
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Thank you

165
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
It was a really boring interview because Jonathan Davis

166
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,887
I don't really know much about politics and I don't want to sound stupid but Obama's trying to be a dick

167
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Kind of sucking his dick

168
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,871
Because he's a Starbucks celebrity so much

169
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,711
The in the beginning of the interview that's the only clip I really regret not cutting

170
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,879
I've been a long-lived room all the time

171
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Okay so now I imagine Alex

172
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
Just driving around in his Escalade listening to

173
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,727
Something

174
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
Listening to

175
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
Bullet with butterfly

176
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Dude I got nothing

177
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
I'll let you know any cornbread

178
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
Alex loves new metal

179
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,831
I listen to that like this is not usable either

180
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
2013

181
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,743
I would remind

182
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Chart success

183
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
I do

184
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
Strolling around another day

185
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Because this is too weird

186
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
I couldn't unpack it new too long

187
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Actually listen to the whole thing by

188
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Look for this in the future

189
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,479
Alex Jones

190
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
What

191
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Alright

192
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,671
I had no time to like

193
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Do you live that appropriately

194
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
It's like I got to put on the back burner

195
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
I heard that all the time girl

196
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
I found

197
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Something that would work

198
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Something fitting

199
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
And that is

200
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Time that Alex Jones

201
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Had a preacher on his show name Steven

202
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Anderson

203
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Are you aware of Steven Anderson

204
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
No

205
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
He he runs

206
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Is a church

207
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
That is described as

208
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
Something that makes the Westboro Baptist Church

209
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Look like God

210
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
An intense Church

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Yeah we'll get into some of the specifics about him

212
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
But

213
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
I listen to their entire interview

214
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Man it's really all about

215
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Just arguing about

216
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Free or post-tribulation rapture

217
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Alright

218
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Alright

219
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
I've been I've been wondering when we're going to get into

220
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Tribulation timeline

221
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Pre-tribulation rapture

222
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,591
I have done this strategically in terms of the clips that I have

223
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
We don't have a whole lot from that episode

224
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Because it's really boring

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,343
But you'll see what I mean you'll see where we're going about Alex giving a little bit of an introduction

226
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Steve Anderson

227
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
And then

228
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Talking about a book

229
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
That is a part

230
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Of his foundation

231
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
The foundation

232
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Of his a philosophy I'll explain on the other side of this

233
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
You stupid

234
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Capacitor

235
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
Who's here in studio

236
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
Pastor Anderson

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
What is

238
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
This carol

239
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
The real quick

240
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,743
The caller before they said brought up by Carol Quigley's book tragedy and Hope

241
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Alex

242
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Hands up

243
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Just pretty funny

244
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Do that but disaster

245
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
You're going to have to take away their guns take away their web

246
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
And overcome them

247
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Housing Warren

248
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Obviously

249
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
He's going to put us in a in a in a

250
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
And it's a ciety where we have no Freedom we're completely controlled completely

251
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
We're not going to be able to defend ourselves

252
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,983
And that's why the Bible tells us that Christians are going to be beheaded on Mass

253
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Because the government Enterprise

254
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Tribulation

255
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,695
The tribulation is about

256
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Starship Enterprise

257
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
I could have come up with a

258
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
Am I in my research for the

259
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
For both referee

260
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,055
In my in my preparation for this episode of the sermon that this guy gave

261
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
About

262
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
You're really close

263
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
But Star Wars Star Wars in relation to the Bible

264
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,535
To the dark side and it's like anger

265
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,631
To whatever right

266
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Hateley

267
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
To the dark side

268
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,287
That's not how

269
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
Yeah

270
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,991
He doesn't know s***

271
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
All right I move on to the next

272
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
I don't want to spend an hour listening to this guy

273
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Critically deconstruction the reality of

274
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Of that Star Wars

275
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Eyeballs

276
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
I want to know I don't know how he feels about so many things

277
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Okay

278
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
In the biblical metaphor

279
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
Did Han shoot first

280
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
That's the first question.

281
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Absolutely

282
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
Like when King David

283
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
Killed his best friend

284
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
So here's the next

285
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
Where Alex begins to start reading

286
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
And

287
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
You get some some

288
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Real stupid s***

289
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Feel so pretty quick

290
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,143
12

291
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Colorado

292
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,855
Bowers Elementary School read out loud

293
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,351
He's just making sure

294
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
And neither are you

295
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,783
What

296
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Heath

297
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Alex

298
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
The 1990s 2001

299
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Small Arms

300
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,679
The treaty that they made that in the UN

301
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
I was about to

302
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
I just want to read you hear from

303
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Was put out

304
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Do you want about Miss

305
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Do you have

306
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Myth

307
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
This conference is being convened to draft a global treaty to ban ownership of firearm

308
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,255
The review conference is not about banning small-arms are prohibited from owning legal weapon

309
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
Be negotiating any treaty to prohibit citizens of any country

310
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,215
From possessing firearms interfere with illegal trade

311
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
In small arms are light weapons

312
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
The United Nations programme of action on small arms does not purr

313
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Prescribed or suggest any action against the legal trade

314
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Manufacture possession or ownership of web

315
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
Each sovereign state determines its own laws

316
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
And regulation

317
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
For the manufacture sale and possession

318
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
The firearm by its citizens

319
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
The United Nation

320
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Has no jurisdiction over such Matt

321
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,791
The UN program of action is focused on

322
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
In Small Arms

323
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Weapon

324
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
The program was

325
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
There is no illicit trade.

326
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
No regulation belly regulations

327
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,967
The program was agreed to in 2001 by the 191 member states of the general assembly

328
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Including Parliament members members of the

329
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
The security Council

330
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
They committed to collect

331
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Destroying illegal weapons

332
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Adopting and improving National legislation

333
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
That would help criminalize the illicit trade in small arm

334
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Regulators

335
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Activities of brokers

336
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
And setting strict

337
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Import and Export

338
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
It's not about saying people can't have guns or trying

339
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
It is just a matter of

340
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
Eagle International gun running

341
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
And then you're coming for the illegal weapons

342
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Obvious

343
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
That's not even

344
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,159
Plateau

345
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
So Alex also there was reading

346
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
Carroll Quigley

347
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Editorializing

348
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Crazy

349
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
I'll give you some contacts after we get to this next

350
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Clip where

351
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
He reads like a hunting pack

352
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Archetypus

353
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,431
That's how we eat it's scattershot adding stuff

354
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
That just isn't

355
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
In the texts at all

356
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Really makes it sound like Carol quickly just wrote down like

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
We're going to go after ever

358
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Everybody

359
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
We're going to destabilize

360
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
Everyone

361
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Right here

362
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,359
With such an amateur

363
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Conditions

364
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
Affordable

365
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,488
Well forget

366
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Certainly I can spend all day on that

367
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
No

368
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
So he's using a little sky

369
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,360
He's using a little passage from page 12,000

370
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
12000

371
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
1210

372
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,808
When weapons are of the amateur type of 1880 as they were in Greece

373
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
In the 5th Century BC

374
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Power

375
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Similarly disperse

376
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
And no minority can repel the majority

377
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Yield to its will

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,216
But on the contrary to buy complex

379
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Inexpensive

380
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Can afford to possess

381
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
Or can we have a situation

382
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Who control such specialist weapon

383
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Dominate

384
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
The majority rule

385
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
So what this is actually talking about has nothing

386
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,320
Things to do with taking people's guns or anything like that

387
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Quickly wrote This Book

388
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,464
Sixties has to do with the Cold War

389
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Status quo systems between

390
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
The United States and the Soviet Union

391
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,888
Just on the page before this on page 1199

392
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
He says forecasting can be attempted only by

393
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Extrapolating recent changes

394
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Into the future

395
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,616
But this is risky business since there is never any certainty the present directions will be Maine

396
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
He goes on to really lay out that what he's talking about

397
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
In terms of

398
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
This stuff is

399
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
Back in Early Times

400
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
You had

401
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Really rudimentary weapons

402
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
Absolutely

403
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
In those times

404
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
You had

405
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Armies that were made up of

406
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Citizens

407
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
It so you would have people

408
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
I would be

409
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:11,104
Driven to War mostly by overarching reasons to go to war like

410
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
Encroachment from

411
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Someone's going to wipe us out

412
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Stealing our drugs

413
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
The reasons

414
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
High-end philosophical reason

415
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Things to go to war

416
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Likes self-sustaining

417
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Comes to go to war

418
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
Where is in the future

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Going to become more complex

420
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
And more expensive in that requires

421
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Professionalization of the army

422
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,704
In those cases what you would see is likely

423
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
A reduction

424
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
All out War

425
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Because Endo circum

426
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
You would have

427
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Professional Army

428
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
To go to war

429
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Necessarily for the same reason

430
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
That you could whenever on head sores

431
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
And she'd like that they are willing

432
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Alfred

433
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
That smaller

434
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Right base

435
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
It's your job

436
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
Because Obama said like

437
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
Unpaid 1201

438
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,144
Professionalization of the armed services caused by increasing

439
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Complexity of whack

440
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Weapons

441
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
We may look for with some assurances

442
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
Unless demand for Total War

443
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
Using total weapons of mass destruction

444
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Unconditional surrender

445
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
An unlimited goal

446
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,760
So he goes on to talk about the situation between the United States and the Soviet Union and how

447
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,088
The idea that we're getting worse and worst nuclear weapons

448
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Makes everything much scarier

449
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,208
But also makes the likelihood of any of those things happening

450
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Less likely

451
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Because they're so scary

452
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:38,400
And because there are is not about

453
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Interested

454
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
About internet

455
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Operation

456
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
Minority and majority

457
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
Conversations within that quote that Alex use about like a government

458
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Necessarily oppressor

459
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Its citizens and taken away it's gone

460
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
Now he's talking about this wave at America and the Soviet Union right

461
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Because of their specialized

462
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,168
You know you can't just go to war with America right cuz we're going to

463
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
We can blow you

464
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
That's what he said that's a big part of it

465
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Keep coming back today

466
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
It's a text Fitz.

467
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Descriptive not prescriptive

468
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
He is a historian

469
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Who's talking about the

470
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Friends that have existed

471
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Throughout history

472
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
And civilizations and talking about

473
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
What is life

474
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
To come from these

475
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Befriend

476
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,072
To do X Y or Z could come from

477
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
1208

478
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,544
That I thought was actually very interested

479
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,640
There's still another element of this complex picture

480
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
This is this is also related to weapon

481
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,320
The large part of History over thousands of years shows that the reason political units

482
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Grown larger insert.

483
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
Has been because of the increased power of the

484
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Offensive

485
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
In the diamond

486
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Weapon system

487
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,536
Any periods in which defensive weapon

488
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Become dominant

489
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:15,168
Have been those in which political units remain small and area or even became smaller

490
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
The Growing Power of

491
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Canceled

492
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
The. Of about

493
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
1100 BC to about

494
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,128
8900 maple

495
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Power units so small

496
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
The all power became private power

497
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Imma State disappeared as a common form of

498
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Political organization

499
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
The cerose the so-called dark

500
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
So

501
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Good thing I'm bringing up here

502
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,792
Is that Alex would probably really like the decentralisation of power

503
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
And making power units

504
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Smaller he doesn't like

505
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Federal government you like

506
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,984
The state government so if you really wanted to

507
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
Why don't you f****** tell everyone to get a castle

508
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
But you know what I'm saying like

509
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Even in there he's not

510
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
Carroll Quigley Castle

511
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,296
But this is one of the effects

512
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
If you study history of offensive vs. defense

513
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
Anyway

514
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Because of course

515
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
If you are defensive weapon based you

516
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Are going to

517
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
Stronger

518
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
Smaller tighter nit

519
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
That's that's the whole point if you're

520
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
You're circling the wagons

521
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Everybody's getting his closest pasta

522
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
So they can protect each

523
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Everybody spread out cuz you wanted

524
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Take as much as

525
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,504
Element exact offense

526
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
Yeah that's really fascinating

527
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,648
I found a copy of Carol Quigley's tragedian open

528
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
Nrm game coverage I said f*** this

529
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
1300 pages but I've started reading

530
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
Actually really fascinating so far

531
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
I'm about to

532
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Love gun so my

533
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Much because guns themselves

534
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
According to

535
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Kind of thought process

536
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,920
Are one of the main reasons that we have a federal

537
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
A hundred percent

538
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
Stated goals are defeated by the symbol that he has chosen to love so much

539
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:18,048
The reasons of that like expansionism colonialism were able to be so successful

540
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Every time that they were

541
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Specialized

542
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,216
Military weaponry that at the time

543
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
But everything is so relative

544
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
Tell the time

545
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
This was written

546
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
Again

547
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
In The Sticks

548
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
So

549
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
Well yeah but you saw that the globalist

550
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Anyway

551
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344
I will have a lot more once I finished

552
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,184
Facebook about how stupid Alex is about Carol quickly and tragedy

553
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
But

554
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
Nearby

555
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
And because he is not

556
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
I could be able to

557
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Pretends that he

558
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
I understand

559
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:08,992
Rock Hudson

560
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
Countryside on first dates

561
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,584
I prefer a supposedly fun thing I'll never do again

562
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:30,240
This is the last thing we're going to hear from the episode with Alex

563
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Steve Anderson

564
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,056
But I wanted to play this

565
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Especially

566
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,384
Just to illustrate that Alex is agreeing with him

567
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
And the two of them assorted tag-teaming

568
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
List a conspiracy talk

569
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Is there an agreement

570
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
That's out

571
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
Important

572
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
Play Thunder the dragon what's happening right now

573
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Real real quick

574
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,792
He's going to have cures for diseases in life extension

575
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,656
In 2016 2017 he's been screaming about Trump bringing us

576
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,264
Cures for diseases of life extension

577
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,320
Going to have all the political power

578
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,696
And the Christians are going to declare him to be

579
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
You guys are drinking out of it

580
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
And then

581
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
And then the new embodiment of The Dalai Lama

582
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Including apostate Christianity

583
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,984
All of the major boss religious but it's Christianity for sound Messiah

584
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Okay

585
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Now we are looking for the second coming of Jesus Christ

586
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Comes first

587
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,016
This is the conclusion

588
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,904
Freetress he's a hates the pre-trib guys because he thinks it's a cop-out for Christian

589
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,488
Jesus is going to call you

590
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:05,888
I think it's a function of his weird masculinity

591
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,752
Thrilled to go to the rapture

592
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Christians

593
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,480
Anybody anybody

594
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
Is

595
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
The flavor of the entire

596
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Just them

597
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Nerding out

598
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Real hard

599
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
As if they were talking about Star Trek

600
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
Gamora

601
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144

00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,032
Pulled a bunch of clips from various sermons of Steve Anderson

603

Dammit Dan

604
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Is the worst

605
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
This guy sucks

606
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
Service today

607
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Jordan

608
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
It's going to make you really mad but I promise at the end of this is going to be really funny

609
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
I'm doing this is

610
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,024
One of the very important

611
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
Do this podcast

612
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,632
It was Christianity

613
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
Stealthing

614
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,264
Secretly Dan is an Evangelical Christian

615
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Nokia's

616
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
I've been trying to get Christian iconography into this

617
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Iconography

618
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,432
Like my Cthulhu

619
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
What I want

620
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
What I want to stress is like

621
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
The caliber of guests

622
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Alex has on his show

623
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
Like a lot of times people who come on try and present themselves as like

624
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,328
He's trying to present himself as like a Biblical expert or something like that

625
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Here's the first clip Malibu

626
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Is college

627
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Say in their hearts

628
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
There is no God

629
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
And it's an atheist

630
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Fool's Gold

631
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
That teaches humanism

632
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Atheism

633
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:15,680
Is a lord

634
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,496
Is it

635
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,616
Institutions of Higher Learning

636
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,832
Some of the smartest people

637
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
The Bible says of the word of God

638
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
The simple

639
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
The Bible

640
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,816
The simple I've noticed people when they get paid

641
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,400
It's not even just spiritually they just get smarter

642
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
Did the Bible make

643
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,264
What is a dunning-kruger effect

644
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
Is that the is that the one word

645
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,688
You're kind of dumb you think you're smart you can never know out

646
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
If you don't know how dumb you are

647
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
You never consider that as a possibility

648
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Bruce turn off light

649
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
Restarting off light

650
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,144
You're dumb

651
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
You've never even read the Bible I bet

652
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,824
Multiple times

653
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
What I mean

654
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
Some conversation to have there

655
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,344
Years of abuse Slow Me Down

656
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,696
Destructive Behavior if you want

657
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Convert to Christianity

658
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Cuz he just said it

659
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
He's seen so many people get so much smarter

660
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:54,752
Gyro

661
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Toronto College

662
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Well then you wouldn't be so

663
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,616
Stupid

664
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Here is a ears

665
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,736
Steve Anderson talking about wish for

666
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,088
I grew up always feeling like a second-class citizen

667
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,648
I wish I were a Jew seriously

668
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
Number one man I want to be I want to be his main people

669
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
I want to be the special people

670
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
I learned the truth

671
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
It was excited

672
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
My truth is that

673
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
His church

674
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Are the chosen people

675
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,064
That's too long for me to play it on here but it's just titled

676
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Why we're not a cult

677
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,440
If you got to make that video

678
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
I know it was his church

679
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Are they passed like all the

680
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Bible stuff in

681
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,960
We're the only chosen people

682
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,056
I know for a fact

683
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
That most of Christianity

684
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:08,992
Apple State Christianity founder of the nonprofit

685
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
Faithful word colonero

686
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
The faithful Word Baptist Church

687
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
In Tempe Arizona the Church of

688
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,976
Currently listed as a hate group

689
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
Because of Anderson Rachel stamp

690
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Including the police are radical stances

691
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
That's really actually

692
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
Making whole not races

693
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,824
He used to want to be a Jew stuff that is going to come in

694
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Play of course

695
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,712
From what the videos that I watch it I might have not watched everything but from the video that I watched

696
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
Really seem like a rapist

697
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Little credit

698
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
I'm going to leave

699
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696

Is fine hair

702
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
It's super

703
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,240
Super terrible hair

704
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,872
Established his church on Christmas of 2005 at his home address

705
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,688
Established it as a totally independent organization

706
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,248
The church's website States faithful Baptist

707
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
Faithful Word Baptist Church has a totally Independent Baptist Church

708
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,648
Pastor Anderson was sent out by a totally Independent Baptist Church

709
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
To start it in the old-fashioned way by knocking on doors

710
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
And winning souls to Christ

711
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,608
About a year-and-a-half later the church was moved to a strip mall is also used by Anderson

712
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
Fire alarm installation business

713
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
When questioned about the relationship between the for-profit business and a not-for-profit church in 2009 Anderson

714
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,128
Angrily

715
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
Yeah

716
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,248
Good Times

717
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,160
I'm going to go on the record as saying I think I would rather go to church and some dudes home then in the fire

718
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Do you like holidays

719
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Yep

720
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
And now you have all this

721
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Judaizer

722
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Sears out there

723
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
And how we need to

724
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
Rosh Hashanah and Hanukkah and all that

725
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Bright

726
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Hanukkah's all that

727
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
And they want to get us on all this

728
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Jewish

729
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Hebrew roots

730
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Instead of

731
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Christian holiday celebrated

732
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
I'd rather celebrate the birth of

733
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Christ

734
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
10 Hanukkah which is celebrating dedicating a temple

735
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
That God destroyed

736
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,984
Like you're celebrating a building the Gods

737
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Troy

738
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
Yeah this is where we

739
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
But then later it got wiped out

740
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
Doesn't make any sense

741
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Yeah

742
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,952
You get Hanukkah doesn't make any sense

743
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
Exactly cuz you could make the site like

744
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
His argument that God destroyed the temple and all that could be

745
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
Flipped back that the miracle of the oil

746
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,544
Staying for a few know as long as it is

747
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
God's way of saying

748
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
This is so dumb

749
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Do not buy stuff

750
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
My fantasy is better than your fantasy

751
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
He sounds more by Legend is better than

752
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
But say it that way

753
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,144
Andrew Dice Clay and then he was like well I'm up so I guess I'll

754
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
A little bit later

755
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,128
What's with these other holidays

756
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:52,224
Rust around

757
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,208
That would be a fun show

758
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
Terrible negatives of preacher

759
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,864
BBQ Workshop material

760
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,408
Episode

761
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
Kippur celebration

762
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Terrible

763
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
They they do the opposite

764
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Episode of Seinfeld Delaware

765
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
They have to

766
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Masterbait Salonga

767
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
He's not into that can go the longest

768
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
I will tell you this

769
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Anderson is not

770
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
I would have never got

771
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
She's not into

772
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
Well I'm sure if you would press that would be fun

773
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,503
Drive to Domino's

774
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
What's the real miracle

775
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,695
So the first many episodes of this podcast will drink red wine

776
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Well drinking

777
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,071
Lost for words

778
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Steve Anderson

779
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Thoughts about why

780
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,495
The Bible says the pastor should not be given

781
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Hawaii

782
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Fitbit

783
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
In the Bible is

784
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Fruit juice

785
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
Often is alcoholic

786
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
And other times

787
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
It is not

788
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
But you know what

789
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
After I should not give either

790
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,463
What wait what

791
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
Because if I'm given to the alcoholic drunk

792
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Call kind

793
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
To get fat

794
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
And you know what all across America

795
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
We have fat preachers in the pulpit

796
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Holocaust

797
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
5000

798
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
It looks

799
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
Sounds like

800
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
I'm not mad at all

801
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
I don't drink wine

802
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Cuz that'll get you drunk

803
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Right

804
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
Cuz there are just

805
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
Too many antioxidants in there

806
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
I don't know what an accident is

807
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
But you can't have that in my body

808
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Preachers camp

809
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
You do what you do it

810
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,175
It's a terrible argument that doesn't make any sense

811
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,063
I don't know it's

812
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,463
So let's just go over s*** so far College makes women stupid and everyone else is very very

813
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,535
If you read the Bible you know not to drink fruit juice

814
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,631
Steve used to wish you was Jewish Pastor shouldn't be fat and Hanukkah doesn't make sense

815
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
First Porsche

816
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,055
Church of God

817
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,919
Or ye also have suffered lights

818
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Even as they have

819
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Juice

820
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,111
Elbow

821
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
Please knock

822
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Is he making a point here or what

823
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Who killed Jesus

824
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
They killed their own profit

825
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
Persecuted

826
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,127
Please God right now please not God

827
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,247
Maybe I just don't get along with you certainly there's somebody

828
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Take it along with

829
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Sing other country.

830
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
No

831
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Preferably they must get along with someone

832
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
Okay okay

833
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
This is breaking the lid wide open

834
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
God is enough

835
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Hint

836
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,799
That explains so much are version of God

837
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,615
Bear version of God

838
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Jeep

839
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,855
I don't I don't I don't like

840
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
I realize keeping a little bit

841
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
In terms of

842
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
What this guy is capable of

843
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
Okay I just was like

844
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
Are you insinuating

845
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
Get along with anybody

846
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
And like

847
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
For all time

848
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Christ

849
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
Sure

850
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
He's going to give us

851
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Three more things

852
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,663
No cuz we got to move on to some

853
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
And move on to something else very important

854
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,319
Alright you're talking about pouring earlier right

855
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Either way

856
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
P*** or not

857
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
You know

858
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
You're struggling with

859
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Bust

860
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
Just one of those deadly sins

861
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Like fruit

862
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Steve Anderson

863
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
Is the key

864
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
The getting around this

865
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Lust

866
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,775
Richest people have come to me and

867
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,079
You know I struggle with

868
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
First of all I like the

869
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Be a lot of people come up to me

870
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
Set up

871
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,783
Let's just say I'm at the grocery store

872
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
Somebody comes up

873
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,367
We're back to hockey Stadium

874
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
Party people

875
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Have come to me

876
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
And that you do

877
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Struggling with

878
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
You know the temptation to fornicator or temptation

879
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Fear Temptation with love

880
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Solution

881
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
A saying that

882
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
And say

883
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
That's just so wicked and ungodly to say that you know

884
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
That the purpose of getting married

885
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
What the Bible says

886
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
That's what it teaches okay this is it really

887
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Biblical teacher

888
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
From the Bible

889
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
People like it or not

890
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
God's work

891
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Purity

892
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
Marry than to burn

893
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
That's what the Bible says

894
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Okay

895
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
That's weird

896
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
I mean

897
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,431
Fairly innocuous for a cult

898
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,319
Strawman argument to like people's criticism of him

899
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,927
Marriage does not

900
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,999
Deal with lost issues people cheat on their spouses all the

901
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,583
F****** time

902
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,911
See there's all kinds of you know there's all kinds

903
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
The divorce has become

904
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
From

905
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,799
Lost on either Partners part and then

906
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:46,175
People with the first people say you're dumb

907
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Because

908
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:53,599
I would doesn't solve the problem you're singing this one would be so far down on my list of things to talk to him about

909
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,743
With this are you a Nazi and then maybe after a week or so I get down to

910
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
What's up with that

911
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
You do

912
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
Are you saying you don't fucken your marriage is that what you say I'm not sure what you saying but I didn't cuz I thought it was real dumb

913
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983

Thinking about it

953
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
That is V

954
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Heart

955
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
Of just about every conversation that I have with

956
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Like Christian peep

957
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,847
Specifically

958
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
My family is

959
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
I'm not going to

960
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Engaged

961
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
Obvious

962
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,367
I don't need to learn anything about it

963
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
I can see from here as

964
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,303
You know what

965
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
The goddamn film

966
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,423
And it's about the joy of muse

967
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
Family is held

968
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:00,991
The cocoa is in any way related to how I feel about my childhood this sounds demonic

969
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
Actually

970
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,111
You just actually embodied why they

971
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
Is because

972
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
There

973
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
Perception is that if you get too close

974
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:19,167
Desire to stay far away by being like it's

975
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,263
Desire U2 stay Faraway is essentially

976
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,151
Ignorance and cowardice running your life hundred percent

977
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Absolutely

978
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
You is you heard

979
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
He got raped

980
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
What does Subway

981
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
The music is so good

982
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Subway

983
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:45,023
Is kid got a kids meal

984
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Enough to make a f****** video in his car

985
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
Did he let his kid have soda I don't know I can't at that time

986
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
I can say I can't say either way on that

987
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Vitamin Diet Coke

988
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
That's still how you get

989
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
But

990
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
Aspartame

991
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
I'm here is that

992
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,919
Subway

993
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
Yes what's up

994
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
Other words for places

995
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
There is no food

996
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
You think their food in hell

997
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,671
You think that in hell they're serving up

998
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
Mealtime

999
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
For breakfast lunch and dinner

1000
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
If a person goes to hell

1001
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
Good food

1002
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Yeah

1003
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
You got a lot of

1004
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
So much

1005
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
How much badge

1006
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
You go to hell

1007
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
You never even

1008
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,903
So that means that like sort of the metabolic processes have to stop right and I would assume that means my son

1009
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Central nervous system

1010
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Some stops

1011
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,511
2

1012
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
Okay so my body just magically create

1013
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Energy then

1014
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
When I'm down in hell

1015
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
God Mash

1016
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
The Devil Run

1017
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,847
So okay so God is allowing the Devil to

1018
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Continue like

1019
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,687
My pain sensors and what have you heard

1020
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,503
No there is nothing to power any of it

1021
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,879
Okay

1022
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Ezekiel

1023
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,423
Remind me how traumatized I was by the song by the Newsboys

1024
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
That Christian rock band

1025
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,031
The song called They don't serve breakfast

1026
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Inhale

1027
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,871
And when I was there

1028
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,271
I can ask

1029
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Country song

1030
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,111
Like a Waylon Jennings song about a guy who

1031
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
Teeth punched out

1032
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
Breakfast

1033
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,463
Lennie kills the man later

1034
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,023
They don't serve breakfast

1035
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,119
He'll talk to songs like at all

1036
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
They would always

1037
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
Play the song

1038
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,959
Blaring

1039
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,007
Over the loudspeakers to wake us up

1040
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:10,687
Hell yeah and I don't know anyone out there who's actually heard this song

1041
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,247
But it is not something you want to wake up to

1042
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:18,111
Terrible I feel like I still ring through my head I might know all the words

1043
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
About the Newsboys

1044
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Their band

1045
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
That

1046
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Feeling always played a part in my life

1047
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Because of that

1048
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
But I don't follow them on Facebook

1049
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
I would

1050
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,751
Like something that they post on Facebook

1051
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Your

1052
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,359
Your setups for these are getting more and more torturous

1053
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,199
Subway reference I was like

1054
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,015
Okay and then I got

1055
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
I got it you're going a long way for this

1056
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:53,439
Look up taking us out a Long John

1057
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
Pastor Steve Anderson

1058
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,583
Has some very interesting rules about what he likes on Facebook

1059
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,423
When your friend comes to you

1060
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,471
And lovingly tells you

1061
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
You're going down

1062
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
A dark path

1063
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
Yeah I'm worried about you

1064
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
You're going down a dark path

1065
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,687
What you're doing wrong here's what the Bible says

1066
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
You know let's get this right

1067
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Come back to the Lord

1068
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
That

1069
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Things that we need

1070
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,879
To do

1071
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
On every Bass

1072
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
A baby picture

1073
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Looking like

1074
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
Pictures of an alcoholic

1075
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
Honda palizzi attire of a harlot

1076
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
And we're clicking like

1077
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,311
I don't ever click like on a picture on Facebook

1078
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:45,407
Unless properly

1079
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
I mean

1080
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
Ouch

1081
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,951
Underwear

1082
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
No life

1083
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:07,423
I think you're trying to do comedy

1084
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,263
Clearly

1085
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
Bottle of booze in the picture I'm not cooking like

1086
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Woman in pants

1087
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,391
You don't like that

1088
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
I just love that

1089
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:37,887
She's up there giving a sermon like this in front of his congregation

1090
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,519
1970

1091
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
Before he starts with like you know your friends

1092
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:51,967
If you're doing something wrong I don't like pictures

1093
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
If your friends are getting away from

1094
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
From God

1095
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Take them aside

1096
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Can you say hey

1097
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
This right let's get

1098
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Set you back on

1099
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
Now other

1100
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
People go on Facebook

1101
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,767
They're f****** all the time got their babies and you click like

1102
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
You sinful p

1103
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
Pieces of s***

1104
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,375
You sit it's what you might as well have had your own

1105
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,751
Picture goddamn you if I see you wearing pants

1106
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:18,591
And I wear short skirt it should be a long dress

1107
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,383
All the time

1108
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Ankle

1109
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
No it's got to have

1110
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
Like where

1111
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Where did God really fall

1112
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
On the below the knee

1113
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
I don't know man

1114
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
You said you didn't put that so popular cuz he really got into

1115
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,127
Skirt length but look this is all just about subjugation of women

1116
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:58,527
Install about reinforcing ideas

1117
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
When was all about the

1118
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,463
We live in a day where husband don't want to provide for their wives

1119
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:12,607
Deadbeat husband

1120
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
And sometimes

1121
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,679
Literally

1122
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:21,823
Stay home energy

1123
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,687
Which situation that needs to be

1124
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:34,623
T.i. and I are old-fashioned traditional is man need to fulfill that role of being a perv

1125
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,463
And we need

1126
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,767
The one paying the bills going to make the rules

1127
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,583
That's a general

1128
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,399
And we have men need to be a provider

1129
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,959
Our wife should be able to say

1130
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
Providing and I shall not

1131
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
1

1132
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Well

1133
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
I think I think

1134
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,895
What's craziest about that is

1135
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Just the ideas like

1136
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
No collaborate

1137
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,783
Men need to make all the money

1138
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,087
Because you make the money you make the rules

1139
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
And you don't want you're making the rules

1140
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,255
Supposed to be

1141
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:20,959
Collaborate on the best rules for whatever we want to live our lives together

1142
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
Oh let's see I want to do X Pursuit that might

1144
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Business

1145
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,599
What is a doctor and she makes all the money for a while while I'm

1146
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Huaraches

1147
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
Supporting me as I

1148
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Nurture

1149
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,351
Partnerships could lead to better outcomes for

1150
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,399
Possibly as opposed

1151
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,727
Ratcheting who sells vent

1152
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:57,311
Chains made of the rules that you don't understand

1153
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,383
Shouldn't want even though you're told that you have to make them

1154
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,687
I think it's something along those lines

1155
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,479
But you'll notice that all

1156
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
Do not commit

1157
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,855
With the nerdiest lamest voice telling me about what

1158
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,159
Men now what

1159
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,463
Bright

1160
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,767
You're clearly just overcome

1161
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,583
Open setting and you're probably gay

1162
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
Interesting you should say that

1163
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
Cuz this next clip

1164
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,751
Sean McEwen

1165
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,055
That's

1166
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
But my question

1167
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
Hello Seth Anderson

1168
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
Is my gun from Nevada

1169
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Sure

1170
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
YouTube lately

1171
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:46,975
And I called someone usernames where you are saying

1172
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,303
The gays have a reprobate mind in a

1173
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
Yes we had to cast

1174
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,887
Don't have your chairs not just wondering

1175
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
Is it

1176
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,983
Somebody that was gay

1177
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,775
Actually be saving

1178
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,127
No I don't believe so because of the fact that

1179
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Where

1180
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
Jesus talked about

1181
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
People

1182
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:14,367
Whose Hearts have been hardened in there and their eyes have been blind in fact I'll read it for you

1183
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
It says in

1184
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,463
Verse number 39 of jonquel

1185
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
Therefore they

1186
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Could not delete

1187
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:25,631
Because it is I said before he has blinded their eyes and hardened their part

1188
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Debate tonight

1189
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,471
See with their eyes nor understand their heart and beat

1190
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Convert is a

1191
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
The strata knife to kill them

1192
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,383
He talked about people's eyes are blinded their heart is hard for they could not be

1193
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,943
And I think that enrollment

1194
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Clear that

1195
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,295
The reason why

1196
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Pretty hard dick

1197
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
Casting a Google thing

1198
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743

Cujo

1207
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,527
Ain't God in their knowledge the Bible says and they are haters of.

1208
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
Haters of God the haters

1209
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,927
So a little bit of correctly John 12:39

1210
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
No gay

1211
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,279
No I think it's also actually about just like non-believers

1212
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
I was about

1213
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Anyway

1214
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:33,471
Fun facts about about Steve

01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
That you met his future wife is Susanna

1216
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
Fallout evangelizing

1217
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Streets of Munich

1218
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,175
He converted to Christianity and they were married shortly afterwards

1219
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479

1222
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
The Creep

1223
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
I'm getting you know

1224
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
You get the

1225
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,351
You've run into these cats

1226
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,399
Goat

1227
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,823
I get this Vibe of like you found this you know person in a foreign country and we barely could speak to each other

1228
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:15,455
I am doctrinated hurting my very bizarre version of Christianity took her away from her family

1229
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
In Germany and brought her back

1230
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
Stateside in Maui

1231
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,599
Gucci stock

01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
She doesn't wear pants

1234
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,303
Need to do that with people that you take from a foreign country

1235
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
People people who bring over

1236
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Your life

1237
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
I just get that vibe

1238
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
Also

1239
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
On the other complaints about gays

1240
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,407
Very weird there was so much

1241
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
You did the exact like

1242
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
That little answer to the question

1243
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
Was exactly what

1244
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:54,111
I have heard from somebody

1245
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,415
Former Christian

1246
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
People

1247
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:05,375
Define because some people think it's gross and you're like wait what did you say

1248
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:10,495
You said some people he starts 90 something percent of people

1249
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
Think it's disgusting

1250
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,591
And if you take the homosexual population

1251
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
Who definitely doesn't think it's disgusting

1252
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,199
And then you just take the people who are like

1253
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,551
Having sex with someone of your same gender

1254
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
I don't think that's weird a gross at all

1255
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,623
That's not

1256
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,671
Just 10% of the population

1257
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:32,511
Unless you're including all of the world there's a lot of like the third world

1258
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,071
Countries where I'm sure that would bump the average up

1259
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,655
Either way it would never be

1260
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
That's crazy

1261
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Because I listen to this

1262
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
I can't

1263
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,903
You guys don't even know what I do

1264
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Yu-Gi-Oh diva

1265
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
Adventure

1266
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
You're going to

1267
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
Germany

1268
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,935
For they have a hair on their face

1269
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,103
He's banging on the f****** Pettit like his his pulpit

1270
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,175
So hard

1271
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,271
None of that you don't you don't feel that kind of passion

1272
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
Little known fact

1273
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
Do you

1274
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:33,183
Steve has been kicked out of multiple countries for his homophobic preacher

1275
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Kicked out of Canada

1276
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
For not letting me

1277
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,399
Country is they said that the

1278
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,983
On the radio program

1279
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
Where Botswana

1280
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Deported me

1281
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,871
It's on the radio about the homos

1282
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
They said well done

1283
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
You know because they

1284
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
We're not going to lie

1285
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,319
That's not in an interview that

1286
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:05,951
Deported from Botswana

1287
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,303
Telling people that homosexual should be Park

1288
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
Today's like

01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
You don't want to hear anymore

1290
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423

I'm wearing pants

1292
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
I'm not allowed in 45 countries because

He has a nut and a bolt

1302
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
Okay

1303
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
And this is a bowl

1304

First off

1325

Did he screw the did he like twist the nut into the Bolton like screw it in there like not how it works

1326
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
He does not know how to sex

1327
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
You may not

1328
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Good fun

1329
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,575
Cuz he's making that stupid arguments

1330
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
Delmar

1331
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,159
Go to the

1332
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:12,927
Church

1333
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:18,559
Sitting there in the sermon watching the pastor goat

1334
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,631
Oh man I can't imagine being like

1335
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
This guy

1336
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Get it

1337
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,735
I think I want to go I want to see how long ago

1338
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
I can take it

1339
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,343
Laughing I think this next ramp might

1340
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
What stand-up to him

1341
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:51,071
Preachers that are a spiritual babe in Christ

1342
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
They don't bully me

1343
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Wake me up

1344
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,847
Sodomites and queers

1345
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,663
You're so alone

1346
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,735
Need to man up and stand up

1347
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
What are you going to do

1348
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
And the reprobates are always bullies aren't they

1349
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:20,255
There's such a small minority but they're always

1350
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,047
Minority

1351
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
And then

1352
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
Phrasing

1353
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,847
You know what

1354
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,687
Cuz it made me so mad that I'm still mad I still hate their guts

1355
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
I still hate these reprobates

1356
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:46,623
I still hate these sodomite I still hate these haters of God

1357
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
And we need some preachers

1358
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
No

1359
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,655
The baby crying

1360
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:05,055
Tell us that we're not like Jesus and you don't even know Jesus Jesus Jesus

1361
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,271
Did he get sexually assaulted

1362
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,599
I feel like you probably got

1363
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
That's one of the possibilities

1364
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,815
He's doing now is not

1365
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
Not appropriate

1366
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
The other possibility is

1367
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,703
That he had gay feelings

1368
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,751
Seventh grade or something like that

1369
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,079
Or maybe somebody is beating out of

1370
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,127
Maybe like he was

1371
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Not the amount of

1372
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Obviously

1373
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,479
Obviously his feelings were not beating out of

1374
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
It was like he was

1375
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Picked on for

1376
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
In February

1377
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Opus X

1378
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,511
There's a lot of possibilities

1379
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,071
The context to know but whatever

1380
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Is something ink

1381
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,143
Credibly emotionally-charged

1382
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,751
Andy trauma that he's very specifically saying happened in 7th grade

1383
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:11,359
That has led him to hate people with a violent passion

1384
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Please go to therapy

1385
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,575
This is not the way to work those feelings out that's not that is not good

1386
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
Put your big cock in my mouth

1387
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,743
You bully

1388
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,887
What they want they try to cram it down everyone's throat

1389
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
Realities of like

1390
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,031
If he is talking about being the victim of some sort of

1391
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,823
Basalt

1392
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:46,431
Terrible

1393
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,503
It's how you feel about serial killers when you hear about their child

1394
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
It always

1395
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,599
There is there's always some sort of serious

1396
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,879
Trauma there

1397
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
I feel for you.

1398
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
That's awful

1399
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
You're awful now

1400
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,815
Yeah yeah I can't we can't go back and fix that

1401
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,607
You should try to go

1402
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Therapy

1403
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,167
But for the time being

1404
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,447
You're killing me

1405
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,751
It's an intensely complicated

1406
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
Version of a balance

1407
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,335
Empathy and

1408
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127
Disgust

1409
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
If possible

1410
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Soufeel

1411
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,711
Epic for him

1412
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Forgot

1413
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,295
From here is obvious

1414
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,647
The fuk out the window

1415
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
With Mike.

1416
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
Everybody passes

1417
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
Steve Anderson

1418
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Baptist Church

1419
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327

1420
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
Video about

1421
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,447

1422
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Orlando

1423
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
A Muslim terrorist

1424
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
Went into a gay bar

1425
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
Another 50

1426
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Pizza mod

1427
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Selfless

1428
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
Shot

1429
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
And

1430
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Here's the good news

1431
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
The bad news is

1432
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Pedophiles

1433
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,119
In this world begin

1434
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
They're bunch of disgusting

1435
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,935
Pedophile

1436
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Come here

1437
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Are a bunch of

1438
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
Gassing

1439
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
Okay

1440
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Just now going to be

1441
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,199
I'm sure

1442
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Gun control

1443
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
Where you know law-abiding

1444
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
Normal American

1445
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
5 guns

1446
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,671
For self-defense

1447
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
And then I'm sure it's also

1448
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
So-called

1449
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
So-called

1450
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:45,983
The two things there is like that's how it's going to go without the subtext with the the

1451
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
Good thing these

1452
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Homosexual

1453
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,151
He always

1454
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,759
In all of the interviews that he's given that have been like

1455
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,135
I'm glad people died

1456
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,951
Because they are gay Pacific

1457
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,975
Play I'm glad

1458
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
People are going to come out

1459
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,815
Give me for hate speech I don't even understand

1460
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,679
Hey I'm just going to go out

1461
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
And say that if

1462
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
Said immediately following

1463
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
His church

1464
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,103
Shut the fuk up

1465
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
Christians are dead

1466
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Maybe

1467
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,759
Maybe some Christian

1468
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,783
Would call that

1469
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
Possible

1470
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,415
Right how do you get to that place

1471
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
I think

1472
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,255
I'm glad that

1473
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,583
Here's an interview that he gave in to BBC

1474
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Documentary

1475
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,679
It starts with him and then I will

1476
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
Ghost

1477
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
So the interviewer

1478
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,311
Normal people homosexuality and pedophilia are disgusting

1479
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
The interviewer says

1480
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,175
Pedophilia homosexuality

1481
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
In the same group

1482
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
He respond

1483
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,247
They are in the same group

1484
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,319
Because any man who would have sex with another man would have sex with anything

1485
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
.

1486
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Like I'll put it this way

1487
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,927
Sex with another man would have sex with

1488
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
An animal

1489
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
Interviewer that's blatantly not true though

1490
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,583
He responds it is true that's reality even if you don't

1491
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
It's reality

1492
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
So you're Nibiru

1493
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,935
What do you think homosexuals should do that

1494
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
He responds

1495
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
Kill

1496
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
As far as I'm concerned

1497
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
Because they're horrible Wicked people

1498
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,847
They're just going to keep elastic

1499
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
Destroying people

1500
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,455
So I don't have any advice for homosexuals except to put a bullet in your own head

1501
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
So you don't blast my kids or anyone else

1502
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
System thread

1503
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,951
I think he was probably the victim

1504
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Some sort of assault

1505
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
When he was younger

1506
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
He is conflate it is mine

1507
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
That

1508
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,095
Oh

1509
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
Homosexual

1510
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,935
The same

1511
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,727
Is the person who assaulted me

1512
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Is really sad

1513
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,151
I mean it's at the same time armchair

1514
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:05,503
Psychology to be like well clearly based on what you said

1515
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,527
You were blessed

1516
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
There's a child

1517
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
And so are you you're caring this

1518
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Hatred with

1519
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,975
Is really likely right now but I'm not going

1520
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,255
You just go out

1521
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,815
Childish misunderstanding

1522
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,375
Without psychoanalyzing him

1523
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
From a distance or whatever

1524
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
I agree with you

1525
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
Very likely

1526
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
Explained

1527
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,591
Cosmology

1528
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
Handle you causing

1529
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
To a bunch

1530
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
Two people and

1531
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,527
The misleading of 150 or however many people he has

1532
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
In his

1533
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
And

1534
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,623
He's the type of person

1535
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
Who Alex Jones

1536
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
Willingly has on his show

1537
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,255
As an expert on religion

1538
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,327
Now I told you it was going to be terrible

1539
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
And then it was going to be hilarious

1540
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
He used to go on

1541
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
Michelle

1542
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,799
In like 2009 or so back in back in a ways in the past

1543
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
And in my looking around

1544
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
I found this

1545
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Video

1546
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,455
Pretty currently

1547
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Pretty funny

1548
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
To give you some thoughts

1549
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
And tell

1550
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,471
Going down the road

1551
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,103
You know Alex Jones

1552
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Quiet

1553
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,199
Is it because I was bored

1554
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,535
I washed

1555
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Just real quick

1556
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
You like them

1557
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,543
We have 5 episodes about why if that's a problem

1558
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Time

1559
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
When we came out with our film

1560
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,295
The tribulation

1561
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,111
You know Alex

1564
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
New World Order Bible verse

1565
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,127
Just come out and say

1566
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
I'm gay

1567
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Email

1568
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
This point

1569
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
Infowars.com

1570
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
A worthless

1571
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,007
Emigrate

1572
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
These people why are they

1573
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:16,479
So get this

1574
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
Okay which is like this

1575
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
So boring

1576
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,447
Pro homosexual

1577
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,287
All three

1578
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,871
Homosexual

1579
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,687
No Pro Trump

1580
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
Man

1581
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,463
So one real quick

1582
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,791
Last little Parting Shot hear from that video

1583
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:14,848
You know anti-islam

1584
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,128
IJustine

1585
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,456
Republican neocon

1586
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,992
Warmonger

1587
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
Apparently

1588
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,600
How is it feeling inside

1589
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,512
You can't do that

1590
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
So crazy

1591
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,144
Get it and then just not be able to

1592
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
Turn and look in the mirror

1593
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,520
It's an unbelievable story of

1594
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,360
You know we got this Gaston Alex Jones Show Who's just

1595
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:54,016
On the surface appears to be someone who's into post-tribulation Rapture and then it turns out

1596
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:58,368
Is a really weird Christian

1597
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
Seems to have some

1598
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,440
Strong feelings

1599
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,536
And then also

1600
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,816
Also goes on

1601
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
Violent

1602
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,656
It's about homosexual to the effect

1603
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,008
Even going so far as to say that they're all pedophiles and he's glad that they got killed

1604
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
We can use contacts

1605
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,616
Clues to figure out why that's the case

1606
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,432
And even he

1607
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,200
Idiot

1608
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
Can't believe they

1609
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:29,088
It's a broken clock is right once it halftime

1610
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
How does that happen

1611
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,160
How does it finally over

1612
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
It wouldn't

1613
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,744
Also I like it I like how it's boring

1614
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,096
These guys are just boring

1615
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
It's because there's a

1616
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:46,240
Just anti-muslim and anti

1617
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Wichita

1618
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,920
Exactly

1619
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:58,272
And they're not invited

1620
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,832
Come on and they are selling

1621
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,392
Because even Alex is smart enough to know when someone

1622
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Bad for business

1623
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
You know

1624
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,744
Get involved with somebody and it's

1625
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,608
When somebody's bad for

1626
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
And that's crazy because

1627
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:19,264
Is still coming on realized

1628
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,080
We haven't even him just saying all these shootings are fake

1629
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,384
Look like that terrible for business

1630
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,688
But somehow I got to get more out of

1631
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
I'm too long

1632
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,760
This guy saying that

1633
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
Good people died in Orlando

1634
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
You can't keep that guy

1635
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Even Alice

1636
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
Conspiracy

1637
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,232
Okay faithful Word Baptist

1638
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
W b

1639
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Friends with benefits

1640
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Alright

1641
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
Fair enough

1642
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
This is an interesting

1643
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,384
Difficult episode 278

1644
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
That's such a

1645
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
Dunning-kruger effect explanation

1646
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Perfectly

1647
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
Like that guy

1648
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
Is smart enough to realize

1649
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,952
That they're putting out this dumb s*** over and over and over

1650
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
To realize that

1651
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
He is doing the same

1652
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,584
Yeah yeah pretty much

1653
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,864
Can't figure that

1654
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:20,960
Next Level out because of how

1655
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,240
Ansley Payne

1656
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,592
The piece of

1657
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,688
But unfortunately the end result.

1658
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
Brett

I'd like to look

1661
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
Almost caught leaders don't

1662
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,880
Don't come from peaceful childhood

1663
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:45,792
I don't know at the end of the day all I wanted to do here was take a little journey through one of Alex Jones has gas

So far on the in our Facebook group to go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

1677
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,456
It does look like the people are enjoying

1678
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,504
The idea of doing a bracket of sound bites

1679
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
Instead of a super long one

1680
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,112
So I think I will

1681
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:46,464
Looks like we're going to go I apologize

1682
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,304

More

1686
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
Expensive and complex

1687
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,544
In order to ensure that the majority

1688
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
Take over the house

1689
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,664
You got to do

1690
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:11,552
Alexandra first in color with your Japan I love your work
