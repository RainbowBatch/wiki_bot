Alex Jones Infowars

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
But the twist

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:28,160
I know a lot about listen to his show

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
You do not

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,400
This is like me watching the Sesame Street at

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Conspiracy theory

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
I wanted to start Today's Show we're going to be covering the February 24th episode of the Alex

11
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,664

00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
Alright

16
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
I wanted us to have that fun before we start because today is going to be rough

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
Is that a new outro

18
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
This looks like pedophilia

19
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
I want to be a little murky in a little bit difficult

20
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
First time that I've raged turned off the show episode

21
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
Stand getting through the last hour

22
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Holy cow

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
So I don't know what happen

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,800
The last hour all I have is about two hours of the show that I

25
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Documented

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
I watch the last hour and it was just an apology for the first

27
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,272
I feel like

28
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,416

29
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952

43
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
I just want to own it

44
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
When we last left you

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,248
Alex Jones did a 13-hour live broadcast

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Because you lost

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
How to sponsor with a draw

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Cuz he was broke

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,464

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Tim's of

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Yeah but

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
We're all that free speech

53
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
He does this 13-hour broadcast most of it

54
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
He just does his Regular Show then he leave

55
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
It comes back to do a Reddit Ama

56
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Okay he doesn't Ama

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
She doesn't answer any question

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
He just screams about

59
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
Wild vultures

60
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
Or was it video

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,512
More

62
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
Question and answer

63
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,424
Reddit proper but you did like an hour and a half of it on his show to work.com

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,008
So he's answered all these also people got a little suspicious cuz

65
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
A lot of his answers ended up with him Hocking product tamao

66
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Waterways

67
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Does that

68
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Broke Alex

69
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
Development yeah it's like a whole different character like words

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
And it's a evil twin of Alex Jones

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
I don't know

72
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,863
So he going to call him

73
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,471
What's the thing that was super fun was I was checking in and watching that 13 hour podcast

74
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
And you have like Rob do hosting an hour and well he's trying to host Alex would storm into the studio and

75
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Start screaming

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,879
Sonia and you can see in all of the people who work at Infowars face

77
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
They are scared of him cuz he is enraged mode

78
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Dinosaur

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
He's trying to build a

80
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Bunk beds at IKEA

81
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Takes it out on those two twin kids that he never want

82
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Robert McAdoo

83
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
But he's screaming at everybody it's great

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
He doesn't come in

85
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Paul Joseph Watson

86
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
The posting which is

87
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
No good for anybody

88
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Friday

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
Tumblr

90
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Are we get to Friday opens the show

91
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
Much of the same way if you're running late for work

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
Call Lannan V your boss

93
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,567
What is Friday Alex Jones here I am on the road I will be in in the next hour

94
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271
Wow

95
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Junctures right now

96
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,183
By the way they're trying to make me have a civil war inside the government block Trump is amazing

97
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
Absolutely critical and we support him

98
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,143
Stephen Colbert

99
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,727
Misrepresenting what I say and what I do is the same type of yuuzhan from

100
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
I want to smoke a full cart

101
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Nicole's the night

102
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
Google

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
13 hour Telethon and a 13-hour drink katanas what words

104
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,047
Deeper into this a little bit later

105
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,399
But he brings up this Stephen Colbert

106
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Yes

107
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,543
Stephen Colbert

108
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
I want to say this and it's not because he's treading in our turf

109
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
Are you with Alex

110
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,831
I kind of unfair

111
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,695
Little bit

112
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,071
Pre-roll this episode as he says some of the worst s*** we've ever heard

113
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,143
Adele before that you're saying is I had your job

114
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
I think the Stephen Colbert thing in in particular is a little bit unfair

115
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,335
Eclipse stuff out of con

116
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,199
Okay we talked about that whenever you're trying to run a clip package

117
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
You have to run

118
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Shortstop

119
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Yeah you can't you can't give it the proper context

120
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
Interesting

121
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Is it

122
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Stephen Colbert is making out

123
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
With context

124
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Is what you're saying is unfair journalism but it could be on the wrong side of it

125
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Is left

126
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Of the monsters

127
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
The crazy person

128
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
That's not fair

129
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Bi-Rite

130
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Just a crazy

131
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,087
Dave Chappelle things like calling someone crazy is the worst thing you can do cuz it takes away

132
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Whatever else they say

133
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
And for good or for bad that's true

134
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
If you just call Alex Jones crazy

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
You're not dealing with

136
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Did stuff that he saying that he believes

137
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Exactly

138
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
F****** president

139
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,311
Specific

140
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
I do think

141
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Much better job

142
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Anyway

143
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Ways to

144
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Immobilized

145
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
To ensure the weeds

146
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,927
I think this entire program we also have a Judas goat one back on all the shows Stephen Bannon is dangerous

147
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Nationalist

148
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,071
One back is openly declaring himself

149
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
Conservative media this year

150
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Once again

151
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
They're doing

152
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
What they say we're doing

153
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Hillary would have been

154
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Conservative

155
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
Media so it's totally fine if Trump actually bands

156
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:03,743
What actual journalistic

157
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
Institution

158
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
Alex spells out a little bit more what he's talkin about disbelief

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Stuff a little later

160
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Look so just like

161
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
Starting it now

162
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
The Glenn Beck openly declaring himself a

163
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Globalist

164
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Seems like a very out of character

165
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,063
Yeah he talks a lot about going back on this episode

166
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,327
Explain tail house

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,447
He became part of the global

168
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Small gas hole

169
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,591
Conservative

170
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Conservative who then

171
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
Play longer system at controlled opposition

172
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
But they lost

173
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,135
Because America wasn't such a critical prices for the intelligence agencies

174
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
Ensure Hillary Clinton

175
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
She did steal part of

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,607
And so now they're in such panic mode

177
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
That's why the government in the shadow government

178
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Behaving as if

179
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
With total arrogance but they're failing

180
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
We have the initiative we have the upper hand

181
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,455
We have Justice in the right side of history on our side and

182
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Most important

183
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Thank you Don your knees

184
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,391
Repent everything you've done I do it all and humble ourselves before the Lord

185
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,023
Fellow Countryman

186
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
Alex Jones this is the infowar and you are the key the critical

187
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
Online advertising

188
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,831
45 ways to defeat that thinks your support so thank you all. Back to the mission from Austin Texas

189
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Didn't David Knight is

190
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Is in the studio

191
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
You got a little bit of the theatrics in there with

192
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Whatever he does not voice

193
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,751
Whenever he does that

194
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,871
I've been keeping a spreadsheet of the times he took this year

195
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
We will be auctioning off the data file

196
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
It's not a hundred percent of the time this is the case

197
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
But every time

198
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
He insinuates that everybody knows something

199
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,399
Or whenever he insinuates that this is widespread information the crazy bulshit

200
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Really

201
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
It's very consistent

202
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
Every time you like

203
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Like

204
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,199
The kids version of holding your crossword

205
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
He knows he's lying

206
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
I think that's the very least subconsciously we

207
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
There's a piece of him that struggling to get out

208
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
This part that knows he's lying is tweeting against his

209
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Conspiracy theory

210
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
I like this

211
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
Okay

212
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
Twin is the good twin

213
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,703
Danny DeVito Arnold Schwarzenegger

214
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Mega buddy,

215
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Now the twin

216
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
He's trying to escape

217
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
The best way I can

218
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,527
Through the ear

219
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
As we all know

220
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
The good hobo Johnson

221
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
It's possible

222
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,863
Pretty good name for a The Shield

223
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Hobo Johnson

224
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,311
What's up Kickstart that s***

225
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,087
Ludacris I thought I was right

226
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Now I know I'm a hundred percent

227
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
Nailed it right on right on

228
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
So he has he has a bunch of thoughts about Glenn Beck

229
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Misrepresents the history of culture

230
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Along the way

231
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,807
It's very dangerous

232
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
Affairs

233
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Capture

234
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,631
Organize

235
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
Good as ideas

236
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,407
Spiritual assistance

237
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Has he come on

238
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Lesbian for Union

239
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
Not really.

240
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
What you're saying is he doesn't like it when a large

241
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Get together to fight against

242
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
A very very rich

243
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Not in that context now

244
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
If you're against the globalist

245
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
You can do tonight

246
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Eeo

247
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
As an interesting question I don't think

248
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
He's a classical liberal

249
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Rachel Jones

250
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
I don't know.

251
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Leave a message by our pills

252
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
I think he would say that he's into unions but what unions are now isn't

253
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Supposed to

254
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
I think that's probably the

255
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Cuz that way he can play Both Sides

256
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,407
Right piece for unions but not in their current

257
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Incarnation

258
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Something like that

259
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,271
He's in your voice

260
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,159
Rationalizing dumbass Bowie

261
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
On four different things that they strive in

262
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
History

263
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
During the murder death cannibalism

264
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,615
Literature and culture

265
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
Wages war against humanity

266
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,279
Paisley

267
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,631
So that's a wild over-simplification of culture

268
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,775
No.

269
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
It's also have a lot of culture

270
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Absolutely

271
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,479
Amazing culture

272
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
They created art

273
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,159
Better whatever shape

274
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
They had sophisticated understandings of the Stars

275
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
The calendar one time is turning for awhile until we found out it was

276
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,359
It's still a great calendar

277
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
It's the word of the day that it has

278
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
Everyday

279
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
What are the days

280
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
The Apocalypse

281
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,839
If you look culture like this it's so black and white

282
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
Dumb it's very dumb

283
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
But I think it's in our understanding Valley

284
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Nuances never been a

285
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
A big portion

286
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
To try and see the best

287
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
In both world

288
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
Historical

289
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Thousands of history book

290
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,695
Probably not about.

291
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,351
Except I think that's what it

292
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Yeah anyway he gets to the headline

293
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Times of the day

294
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Transition

295
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Misunderstanding

296
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Into misunderstanding

297
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
Everything

298
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Jaywalking

299
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
The one worried reset

300
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
Hey look at these people

301
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
F****** awesome would it be if Alex Jones

302
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Here's the headline

303
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Frank

304
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
She sounds glow

305
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
That was a good one

306
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Father

307
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
For 12 year olds

308
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Because they're told to

309
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Sexualizing

310
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Is pedophilia

311
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Is a promotion of himself

312
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
Locker room with his penis

313
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
He totally called Cuomo pedophile

314
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:01,247
In this episode he does call him a predator

315
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,671
Slander territory

316
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,791
But more in like a group situation like he was rattling off a list of names

317
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
And he happened to be on one of them

318
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Yeah

319
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,703
Pedophile cabal

320
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
Sure

321
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:29,919
This is one instance on this episode of maybe three or four where he runs afoul of what I think is illegal

322
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:35,551
Okay well I mean like calling Chris Cuomo

323
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
That might be legally action

324
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
You are

325
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,303
Misrepresented

326
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
Nobody they wouldn't be able to take him to court of course because

327
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,799
They wouldn't be seen in quarts

328
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Throughout the show

329
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
About how

330
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Your you're

331
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
You're being called

332
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,463
Closed-minded and a bigot if you don't want men with their big old penises

333
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
In the locker room with your daughter

334
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
He's not talking about

335
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Trans bathroom

336
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,519
He frames the trans bathroom bill

337
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
The judge

338
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Of a daughter

339
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Yeah because

340
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
It seems like

341
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Your daughter is going into

342
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
To a bathroom

343
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
Yeah we're a big old man's penis

344
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Waiting for

345
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Yeah

346
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Cuz you're like but I wish there were no penis there

347
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Alright

348
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Feeling that that's not the angle that the

349
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Bill axe

350
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
No it's not it's not

351
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
One penis for all bill

352
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,567
This issue

353
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Because I tried to find

354
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Annie

355
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Instant I was trying to be overly charitable I tried to find

356
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Of

357
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,391
Twelve-year-old girl

358
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,720
Attacks or assaults happening in bathrooms because

359
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
The trans individual

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
Yes

361
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Okay

362
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
If you break down what those five are

363
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
The only article

364
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
And he's the only five

365
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
This is the only documented

366
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Things I could find

367
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Insinuation

368
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
No

369
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
These instances were all

370
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Dude

371
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,672
Dress up like women to get into bathrooms to videotape people in the back

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Write this is not

373
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
The issue that we're talkin

374
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
That can happen with or without this pill

375
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Yes just someone

376
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
In a bad 80s movie

377
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,008
Do you want to work

378
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Soju

379
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,360
Is that how

380
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,736
Woodside movie

381
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
Text bones pornos where guys dress up like women to get on a all-female cruise MMA fighting everybody

382
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
I saw the Love Bug

383
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
This is the kind of toxic

384
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,448
Cancerous thinking that is really plugging a lot of people and Alex can't get his head around

385
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Is you judge

386
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
An issue by

387
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
People who aren't

388
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
What the conversation is about

389
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
As we all know that is

390
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
A straw man argument

391
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
Which Alex Jones

392
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Doesn't understand

393
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
That is an argument about men made out of

394
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
These instances can find

395
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Concrete

396
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Aren't indicative

397
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
Of what trains people want

398
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
They want to be able to

399
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
To go to the bathroom

400
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
In the bathroom

401
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
That suits

402
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
What they identify as

403
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
These

404
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
People

405
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
Have assaulted people

406
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Harper Woods

407
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
Who are trying to pull a fast one

408
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
Right that's not what this is about

409
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,576
Is this is so this to me has that same

410
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
I feel of like

411
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Homosexual

412
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
And you're like okay

413
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
So

414
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Amanda man and a woman

415
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Think about the woman

416
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Woman parts

417
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
It's dudes

418
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,984
Johanna oil

419
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,568
Sing your daughter

420
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,944
Protecting your son from a creepy it's never been talked about female to male

421
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Which

422
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,552
Seems like the moment they do they have to start talking about the fact that

423
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Men

424
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Are far more likely to

425
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
To sexually assault another boy

426
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
In the men's bathroom

427
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
Just do to identify as

428
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Pedophile

429
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Yeah

430
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,032
Look up much more likely thing there is that if you are

431
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
You're going to go into a bath

432
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
And there's a

433
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Of you being sexually assault

434
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Altidore physically

435
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,832
List of five and they are real

436
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
And you can find

437
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Centers of

438
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Absolutely

439
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
I mean the argument is

440
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
Makes me Furious

441
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
100%

442
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
It gets

443
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
So much worse on

444
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
This is the thing that I think about

445
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
My parents are almost certainly for the transmat

446
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
I don't think they've ever met at

447
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
I don't think Alex

448
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
The argument makes sense because

449
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
To them

450
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Transfer

451
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Crossdress

452
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,840
They have this image in their head of what the reality is

453
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
It's not they don't understand that you

454
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
That you're you're not

455
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
You're not the

456
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Sing that they say you

457
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
When you go in the into the bathroom

458
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
You're going into

459
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
To the wrong bathroom

460
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah that's

461
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
That's how your life

462
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Every

463
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Time you gone to

464
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
The bathroom for the most part

465
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
You felt like you're in the wrong

466
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,416
Yeah and then now they're telling you

467
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
That you should go to

468
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
To the right place

469
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
That you should be

470
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Force

471
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
To stay in this wrong place

472
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,912
Bucked up for the worst

473
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Yeah

474
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,544
Infected you're asking to do that makes you a

475
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
F****** evil

476
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Anyway

477
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Let's save some

478
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Righteous indignation for when

479
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Really

480
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Leaves come out

481
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,368
I'm already out I'm out of racism

482
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,208
Sexualizing your children

483
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
Volleyball

484
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
Wellness

485
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
What is it what is it that

486
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
He's mad

487
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,760
That Liberals are saying be nice to somebody who's not

488
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Bothering you

489
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
I don't think that anybody who supports

490
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Trans rights

491
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
Would be like

492
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Is out

493
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
You know what

494
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Here's the thing that has happened

495
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,824
I still think you should be nice to them

496
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
This person wants to be a dog

497
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
What are they

498
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Hurting anybody

499
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Sometimes they bark when I walked your dog is a dog park

500
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
Because they're not hurting anybody

501
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,488
But you know what Alex Jones one of those big things isn't about how

502
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Doesn't hate people

503
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Alright

504
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Mental illness

505
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,128
First one

506
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
You're free

507
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,728
16 year old young man

508
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
Little girls

509
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Bored

510
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Call

511
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Michigan

512
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
University Pointe

513
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
No

514
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,704
So I apologize leopard screwing up eclipse

515
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
You can't go from

516
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
From

517
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Showering in high school

518
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
Silly no one's really doing that have been

519
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
For years and years that

520
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
People don't shower

521
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
I was I was afraid

522
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,544
The transition to the white boards down the article that he was talking about

523
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
With whiteboard

524
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,640
And Michigan State University is band

525
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
Whiteboards on dorm room doors

526
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
And they did this

527
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,088
Specifically because they recognize that most communication that's done between people now is on texting

528
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Anton

529
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Twitter

530
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Facebook

531
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,488
There's no real utility to having thing on your wall

532
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Additionally

533
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,608
They had multiple instances of people writing racial slurs

534
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
On them

535
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
And attacking people

536
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,472
Really helped in the

537
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,312
People have been being victimized we're just going to not allow white boards on Doors

538
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Alex

539
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
They could do

540
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,552
Absolutely they're not combating any of the horrible

541
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Slurs or anything like that

542
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
You know what

543
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
This doesn't help

544
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
And it's used to hurt

545
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Sometime so why why

546
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Let's just not do it

547
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:01,216
Point about it one agrees completely with what you're saying is that you're dealing with non-issue and not dealing with the real issue with

548
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
Why would someone

549
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
No

550
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
But then the other pieces that Alex is like they're going to ban any kind of public

551
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,368
So wrong

552
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,208
Yeah like all the teachers want to teach about

553
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
The evils of globalism I don't know what they would be

554
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
Teaching about Teddy Hayes

555
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
About how

556
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
People should be allowed to have Union

557
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
Unionized

558
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
I can't I can't

559
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,640
Can I get to book burning

560
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Stupid

561
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
It's just

562
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Credibly stupid

563
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Is even stupid

564
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
You know what I actually just found out today

565
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
One of the big things that

566
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
What are the big book burning

567
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
The Nazis had

568
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Was actually oven in

569
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Institute that did a lot of trans

570
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,656
Interesting was for a long time in

571
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
Kind of a you know we're all paying attention

572
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
Into this kind of thing we're treating it as

573
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Something that

574
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Real that's

575
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
This kind of gendered

576
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Dysmorphia all of these

577
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
A lot of amazing research

578
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
It was done and then whenever that

579
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Nationalist

580
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Assholery

581
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Started

582
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,160
Then they went to those places and burn those books

583
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Because they

584
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Again they

585
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Master reset

586
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah they wanted to do this stamp out anything that would

587
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Just otherwise

588
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Nothing

589
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Hate

590
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Trans people

591
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Across

592
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,616
You know that we can't make a false equivalency

593
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Nazis a trans people Alex

594
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
But we can say that Milo is

595
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
I've established

596
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm never going to let that go

597
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Leaked

598
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:02,304
Like I don't know hundreds of hours of behind-the-scenes audio from CNN

599
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
Listen to a little bit of

600
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,008
Boring I've lived a little bit of

601
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
Leah and anybody who posted anything about it is all fake

602
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
It's all like

603
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
Someone posted a clip of

604
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
The Dog the Bounty Hunter

605
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
When he left that really racist voicemail and they said it was Jake Tapper

606
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
Ethics

607
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:31,488
Even that's what are you doing

608
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
So Alex has this little

609
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
The statement about the CNN leak

610
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Pick one Vietnam

611
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
None

612
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Tell me you've listened to

613
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
More than an hour of it.

614
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Listen to any event

615
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Pitch meeting

616
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Probably

617
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
I don't f****** know I don't I don't care if it's someone wants to give me a nice detailed non Pizza Goethe breakdown

618
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Uno's

619
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:14,240
Listen to the hundreds of hours of very boring conversation

620
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,080
Repeat

621
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
One of his Old Chestnut

622
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,736
Glenn Beck

623
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
You have a country

624
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
False equivalence

625
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,512
And not true

626
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,328
Even if what he's saying is true it doesn't make sense

627
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,216
And it's not even that this is indicative of something but I want to take a point

628
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
The time to call out which is that

629
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
He has Ally

630
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,848
Which is wearing

631
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,480
The truth is because there were groups of students

632
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Threatening

633
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
It's very much.

634
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,256
Situation all over again going after the real problem just making it a step

635
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
Sure they're forcing that creativity of

636
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Racism and hate to go in another

637
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:21,056
Directions

638
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,200
Repeat

639
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,040
So we can go on

640
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,624
If you're not

641
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,976
Okay and those endo's become like on the Pats

642
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
He steps off of this

643
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Long big narrative and then

644
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
Conflate that with the waist

645
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,168
Plan

646
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Is bad

647
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Just like as you guys already know

648
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Burning Flags

649
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
If I could just talk to him

650
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
Call Savannah Coronavirus

651
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
It didn't cut it

652
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Krowd

653
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Play Weezer everybody gets a big

654
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:10,208
Because

655
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
He didn't

656
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Like he's

657
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,152
People haven't done no the KKK

658
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
No

659
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:36,576
Even though even though everyone's against them everyone thinks they're a bunch of assholes because they are

660
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
No one

661
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:43,232
Band The kkk's Steven start Banning the KKK

662
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,840
But even liberal people aren't like a listen we need to not allow them

663
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
Horrible s*** that they say

664
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
In The Blues Brothers

665
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,080
Even in Liberal bastions like

666
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,920
The Blues Brothers

667
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,224
You guys should probably allow these Nazis

668
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,624
At least say what they need to say it's America slippery slope that even the beginning

669
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Part isn't through

670
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,280
He tries to do this repeatedly with the first they came for blank

671
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
And I said nothing

672
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,544
Unnamed black racist

673
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Cuz we can

674
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
We can't pick one

675
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,944
I assume he either means the Black Panthers or probably now black lives matter

676
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
They're all there are about is cop killing

677
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
Sweet sweet good times Alex

678
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
This he's talking about

679
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
The comments

680
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
Melissa harris-perry

681
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,680
I'll get to explain why

682
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Cinnamon

683
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Complices coach

684
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
But okay

685
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,760
Your daughter

686
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
In the showers with your daughter

687
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Gator

688
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
Hours

689
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,192
Melissa harris-perry

690
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
She was talking about there's a 30 second video that was aired on

691
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
News station

692
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,920
And she's talking about how

693
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
We need to take a more community-based stance on children

694
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
Like we meet

695
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Recognize that

696
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
Children are the property of their parents

697
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
It takes a community

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
To raise children

699
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,400
Essentially literally an old

700
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Maybe she

701
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
Who is maybe a little

702
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
On careful with her words

703
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
But what she was saying wasn't with Alex's

704
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
No she says is that

705
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,688
Children belong to the communities that they live in

706
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Which is to say

707
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
That they are

708
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Apart of the community

709
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,600
Yeah it doesn't mean the community's own the children

710
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
It means

711
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
Everybody is a part of the community

712
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
And if

713
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
Parts of the community are hurting it hurts

714
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
The community as a whole

715
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
Raise a child

716
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
In such a way

717
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
That your child goes out

718
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
Hurts other people

719
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Your

720
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
You're the one doing

721
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,104
Like a child affects everybody else

722
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
Your child can damage

723
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Everybody else

724
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,736
Whenever you

725
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
You say you like

726
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
We are all against you

727
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Being a complete and total a******

728
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Yeah

729
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
Yep

730
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,352
That's the point of all I'm stuck on now all the rest of the ship that he's saying I'm done

731
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
I just want you to be nice to people

732
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Who want to be.

733
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Waterworld

734
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,104
Is do we have a charity for that money to cosplayers

735
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
I guess I don't know

736
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
You're right anyway

737
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
That's stupid

738
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
And I really think that Alex

739
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,256
If he goes back to his inability to comprehend what he

740
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
You see more here

741
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,864
At least they want to destroy the family

742
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Now what you say

743
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
There's no way that

744
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
What she's

745
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
In the worst possible way leads to

746
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
We got to Destroyer

747
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Way

748
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
Veterans

749
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Who made up just

750
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
That one is the

751
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
I don't like that one

752
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Well

753
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,816
Well for him

754
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
He didn't

755
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Listen

756
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
At all

757
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
Yeah

758
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,384
Let's just keep a running tally

759
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
About

760
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
You know

761
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
Trans people in bathrooms

762
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,272
Chalkboard

763
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
We have lies about CNN

764
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
We have a lie about the knights

765
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,952
Circuit about Melissa harris-perry

766
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Nhp

767
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,304
And now we're going to get to one of our old favorites

768
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,632
I don't know I don't care to stand up for him

769
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
In South America

770
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
You talk about

771
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
The Pope

772
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Gotcha

773
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
And villagers by the controller

774
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
You'll have Tommy's on your country

775
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,816
Megabucks

776
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
The elite

777
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:57,247
Yeah

778
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Obama said

779
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
I want to say that

780
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,719
He said to himself

781
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,327
Twin absorbed in the womb possibly trying to get out of that last-second

782
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Just like

783
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,983
You can hit if you can hear me out there if you can hear me out there that sounds racist in classes

784
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,079
Another lie

785
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Known as rounding up thousands of

786
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Priest and villagers

787
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Sure in South America

788
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
Sure

789
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
Toledo Jersey

790
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
No no

791
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
What streets

792
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,671
Where on the streets bathing suit

793
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
America

794
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
We are

795
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:45,119
We need to send a correspondence

796
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,703
The other liar

797
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,591
Figure out that Obama air conditioning went over internet

798
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
That is not at all again

799
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
CDs are all these things we have

800
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Like examples

801
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
6 complete

802
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
Within the span of probably half an hour of his show

803
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
Crazy

804
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,999
You need to keep that in mind for something he says in the future

805
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
What is

806
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
Fabrication

807
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Implies that he

808
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,167
He's like mischaracterizing

809
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
The truth

810
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Can fantasies

811
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Like you write

812
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
Fan fiction for real

813
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Yeah

814
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,711
Paranoid fanfiction

815
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
I mean

816
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
I hate the term but

817
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
If you want to talk fake news

818
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
I know what it is

819
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,207
To let this we can't do it anymore

820
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Anyway

821
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
Fake news is meaningless now it's fake news is

822
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Its own

823
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
Fake news

824
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,703
Alex

825
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
But he has

826
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
Serta trick the media into covering thing

827
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,943
This is his fourth dimensional chess

828
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Colbert attacking me

829
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
Eclipse

830
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,751
But we're not cut some more a bunch of real quick clips

831
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,127
Analyzes propaganda

832
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,319
Shelves

833
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,695
I love that line

834
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
Debate on the

835
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,303
Pickles I love that

836
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,471
That's our first shirt I knew they'd take the base of a pickles

837
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,311
He's arguing he's arguing that like he makes

838
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Sensational claims

839
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
But you know there's truth behind

840
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
In order to

841
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
Confirming the things that he says

842
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,807
Now these example to give

843
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,879
Is Hillary Clinton couldn't open a jar of pickles

844
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
As we all know

845
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
So f****** meaningless

846
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,303
So I mean like you're bigger points you haven't proved it all but yet

847
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,423
That on a f****** Night Time TV show like some late night show

848
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Big rigs

849
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Jar of pickles

850
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Cuz they're doing a bit

851
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
Of course they did they also

852
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
Set up all the conversation we're going to have

853
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
Because it's a show

854
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Is that

855
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,783
What is pickleball

856
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
The fun little turnip

857
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
As a joke

858
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
On Jimmy Kimmel show

859
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,303
Because ever was talked about how weak Hillary Clinton was ever open a jar of pickles

860
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
To prove the cheese strong

861
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
Right

862
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
I don't understand

863
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
Elizabeth like borderline

864
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
This thing right

865
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,663
Maybe like you need your husband to open a jar of pickles

866
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Jimmy Kimmel

867
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,831
I'm sure other reasons be mad at him

868
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,047
The argument that Alex had was that they rigged the jar to make her look strong

869
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,519
Incredibly powerful it just opened

870
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,639
I'm a thirty-two-year-old man I'm in my Prime

871
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,663
I'm fairly strong

872
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
Sometimes I can open a jar pickles

873
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,735
I have to hit the rim with a knife

874
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
In order to

875
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,111
Is it open

876
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,927
Iron Man

877
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
Victim I tricked him into telling people I was right

878
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,703
Again congratulations

879
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,663
A flagrant bulshit points

880
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,015
Anyways

881
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,063
He is influencing

882
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
The mainstream media

883
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
To investigate

884
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
The

885
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Use claims that he

886
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Any makes them

887
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Sensationally

888
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Sensation

889
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
So that they will invest

890
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Instigate

891
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Disprove

892
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Some of the lies that

893
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Detailing

894
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,959
Get to the kernel of Truth underneath it

895
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Subway

896
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,799
But

897
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Sort of

898
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:47,199
Next clip talks a little bit more about it the trolls the media

899
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,855
He said about JLo

900
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
How do you say something about JLo

901
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Grammy's

902
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
About how

903
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
Times like this when artists go to work

904
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
And this is when artists

905
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
Scump most impactful

906
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
When we're dealing with

907
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,543
Power trying to crush

908
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
The disenfranchised

Sure

911
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Phil Coulter

00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
Their society

That down

922
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Absolutely

923
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,551
Women are still sold on slave block

924
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
Slave

Horrifying

934
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
Minimize it by using it as your b******* argument for

935
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
That's a very very serious issue

936
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Is

937
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Really f******

938
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Destructive

939
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,207
Using it as like a

Still even worse

945
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,455
Try to manipulate people in the inner cities

946
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
Really short clip of me saying

947
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
I know we're bigger than they are

948
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,223
Discredited

949
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:37,183
Abusing women

00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,863
Alchemy abalone the Alchemy

951
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,959

Which is what he say

956
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:15,839
If you unpack it what are you saying is like if you love it so much why don't you go over there

957
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:22,495
If you love getting raped so much why don't you marry

958
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,079
To be your anything like that

959
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
Taking him a little bit

960
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,175
I do not I do not like

961
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
That

962
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
Because

963
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,527
AC by exaggerating what he

964
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
He's actually saying

965
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
You're not dealing

966
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
Exaggerating a little bit

967
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
It sound more like this

968
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
You're not dealing with

969
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
The damage that

970
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
What is actually

971
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,375
What would you try to take Alex and turn him into headline

972
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,727
That's where it becomes difficult because

973
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
You can't just say like Alex

974
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Hope Smith

975
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
JLo's gangrape

976
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
And the whole point of this

977
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
Is that when you do that

978
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
You dismiss him

979
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
As a crate

980
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,831
Yeah you know like you see that headline

981
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
Nobody would ever live

982
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
This is going to be the

983
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
The thing that you

984
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Come down or gets rid of it

985
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,767
Do that whole thing

986
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,071
When what he's really saying is

987
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
Just lying about her

988
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
Man

989
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,727
Yeah

990
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,823
You're going to hate him so much more

991
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
That's terrible but

992
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
What is

993
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
Substantially worse

994
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,783
Before we get to the really really terrible stuff Alex 2:30

995
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
To talk about his financial

996
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,391
Situation

997
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,287
Advertising

998
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,687
Ocean

999
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
If it's admitted in the trade Publications

1000
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
That's not his

1001
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
So what is he actually saying

1002
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
Is he saying

1003
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
Or is it in his opinion

1004
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Cuz I can't

1005
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
In one the train public

1006
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,983
They quote Alex Jones

1007
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
That

1008
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
Would be an opinion

1009
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
I'm out on Monday

1010
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,431
And said you no longer have a right to advertise

1011
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Google

1012
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
Black or whatever

1013
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,535
You know you're Jewish

1014
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
You know what that sounds so

1015
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Eerily

1016
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,191
What's up

1017
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
Yeah they won't make you up

1018
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
F****** cake cuz you're gay

1019
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
Yeah that sounds like

1020
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
What kind of sides with

1021
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
They should have made

1022
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
Kind of

1023
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,087
Is it

1024
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
Yeah but he died on the side of a cake and then give them

1025
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,095
You're like if someone wants to put an offensive message on a cake

1026
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
He's like I'll be concerned that it was a trap

1027
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Or something like that

1028
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:40,127
And yes I want a moment to layout a couple of things that are b*******

1029
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,175
The desert is personal thing

1030
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,479
That is still the argument

1031
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,015
That

1032
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,367
Those people married

1033
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
Coaches on their values

1034
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:56,767
Free speech is that will think the moment it's an happens in their Direction

1035
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Conservative

1036
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,959
Bingo you nailed where I wanted to take this

1037
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:12,127
Note to self as a Libertarian and libertarian

1038
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:16,223
In one of the main principles of libertarianism is the SS

1039
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
And

1040
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,343
If you are a Libertarian and you believe what you believe

1041
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
You legitimately have to believe

1042
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,951
The company should be allowed to not sell things to

1043
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
That's part of the free free market

1044
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Which

1045
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
The author

1046
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
You should be allowed to

1047
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Not have to sell things

1048
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
Conservative

1049
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,751
The argument is if

1050
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,383
In the marketplace if you are a business that doesn't serve black people

1051
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,455
Everyone will be so offended

1052
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,271
Right that's your that's your pretend little

1053
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,063
To see event how we actually

1054
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Get rid of racing

1055
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,391
Economically

1056
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
And now

1057
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,583
Libertarian values go by the wayside when an advertising company doesn't want to work with that one

1058
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
We are values are

1059
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Glad you having a

1060
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
You don't believe

1061
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
In the free market

1062
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
Crushed me with

1063
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
The whole political system

1064
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
For the past eight years is

1065
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
As much as I loved Obama

1066
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
Did expanded executive power

1067
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,551
That's why we're in trouble

1068
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,647
That's the big issue is that if your

1069
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,951
You're making this Muslim ban

1070
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
If you do that

1071
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Even if it works

1072
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
Even if it's legally justify

1073
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,655
That still means it somewhere down the line

1074
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
Someone can do

1075
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,215
A Christian band

1076
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,311
Within the realm of possibility

1077
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Exactly

1078
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
Thinking about yourself

1079
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
You should be again

1080
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Because Adventure

1081
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Can be used towards you

1082
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,391
And that's not a slippery slope

1083
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:04,511
Situation in his economic and I will poke

1084
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
You are involved in politics that's LOL

1085
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,895
First of all one of the supplements that he sells

1086
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
In the past

1087
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:25,247
Just kind of insinuated the taking it will help you live to 100

1088
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,599
So the milk-toast isn't really real

1089
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,159
Like advertise their products

1090
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
Affect

1091
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Possibly have

1092
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
Right

1093
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
Second of all

1094
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,095
He's complaining that they say that they're fake news

1095
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,143
Listen to the beginning of this episode

1096
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
We have documented at least

1097
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
The news

1098
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
Really misrepresented the truth

1099
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Meaning

1100
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
Told fake news

1101
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
Yes

1102
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
So he doesn't have a leg to stand on

1103
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,527
All of these stories everything he brings up if you look at is full of s***

1104
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Anyway

1105
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
Federal

1106
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
Election Commission

1107
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:12,095
Alex Jones

1108
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,655
Well you won't tell me so I know like

1109
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,447
That's not true

1110
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
At all

1111
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
Precede

1112
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,455
Oh man if he did see

1113
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Republic

1114
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,015
Haha

1115
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
To say that he is a giant liar

1116
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:41,791
He is so open to all kinds of stuff coming out

1117
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
Like the counter

1118
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,471
Sing

1119
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Be nothing

1120
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Compared to the

1121
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
Billions of Lies

1122
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:59,199
Class action lawsuit filed against super male vitality

1123
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Beautiful

1124
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
So anyway

1125
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,735
Of our own Spirit show

1126
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
OK Google

1127
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,415
And that came in and they said you can't do that anymore

1128
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,495
Mica countertops

1129
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
We have proof

1130
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
This episode

1131
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,367
I'm not saying he's a bad person he might privately be an awesome person

1132
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,903
Also privately

1133
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
He is

1134
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
Weeping on his

1135
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,999
Is it a draw

1136
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:21,631
How do we get our money back cuz I'm publicly trying to

1137
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
KakaoTalk

1138
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:29,311
You guys you guys was literally no way he's going to snow

1139
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:34,175
Will tell him do not do this

1140
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
He does not have it

1141
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:42,111
Well that's his lawyer his lawyer is very unaware of his goings-on

1142
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,671
Legal person will be like please don't do this

1143
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
You will put yourself in the hopper

1144
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,119
I'm not because Google is some shadowy entity that's going to destroy him but because

1145
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,935
His entire operation is built on a House of Lies

1146
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:00,799
There's obviously some shady s*** going on and

1147
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
Discovery

1148
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,455
Mission of that going through all of his files

1149
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
Can you imagine

1150
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:12,575
If he does do them and it turns into a long protracted legal battle

1151
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
What we will end up having to cover will be

1152
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Calculator

1153
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
I'm already jerking off

1154
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:24,607
To the possibility right now

1155
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,679
That sounds like pedophilia bro bro

1156
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
It's not

1157
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Federal Federal

1158
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
They're not

1159
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
No no

1160
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,167
So I mean

1161
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
It's not it's not

1162
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,007
Attacking free speech in anyway

1163
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
It is

1164
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,335
Very legal

1165
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Superliga

1166
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:11,199
The most legal things that you can do as a business

1167
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,527
Is to have is too far for somebody based on

1168
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,855
Reasonable regulation

1169
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,719
Anyway

1170
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,255
We're going to get into

1171
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
Depart of the show that is

1172
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Fuckingawesome

1173
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
Then we're going to the darkness

1174
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,167
Alright so this is our final

1175
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,983
Gasp of air before we go underneath and drowned it

1176
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,335
Breathing breathing this money bullshittin then we're going under

1177
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,407
Ford

1178
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
That's gross.

1179
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
Thousand dollars

1180
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
Most of the show's canoeing like that

1181
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,999
I agree that Elijah's couldn't do that

1182
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,047
Crazy crazy

1183
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,119
They're taking a bath on the pill

1184
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Nuts

1185
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,959
That's what like

1186
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,615
Nobody said a million 50 didn't work

1187
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
Profit margin

1188
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
No that's not good

1189
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
He's got to work on

1190
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503

Hey this is how much we're marking up our product by like you know what else to a couple of these

1193
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
Text clips that we're going to play the ones that don't anger me so much

1194
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
He lets himself slip

1195
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,399
But he really shouldn't be talking about

1196
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
This is another one of them

1197
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,311
You like talking specifics about your finances

1198
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,919
Security number out there as well

1199
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,759

Thank you for the support

1201
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,791
Next year

1202
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,335
It's just like we bought this

1203
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
We don't sell guns that we bought it

1204
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,479
You got done

1205
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Sporting good stores

1206
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:31,487
Pop out

1207
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
About 15-20 years ago

1208
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Lawsuit

1209
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,431
They're blocking your access to the market

1210
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,759
Alabama

1211
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
Oribe

1212
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,855
Arkansas

1213
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:06,815
You're saying you're not allowed in this restaurant

1214
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
No

1215
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,215
Your website

1216
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,055
You're not allowed to make money

1217
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
So one thing

1218
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,151
That's a hundred percent

1219
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,967
In a box if I was going to tell you to go somewhere and die

1220
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Boxbox

1221
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,783
One thing under ground Maybe

1222
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,927
What does it's really important to recognize master of naan

1223
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Metaphors

1224
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,815
Because you saying that gun shops can't advertise

1225
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,839
Wizard ever witch

1226
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
I support

1227
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:44,959
Cigarette companies

1228
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:51,359
That's the correct he goes to Black kidnapping able to go to school

1229
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
Blackheads being allowed to go to school causes cancer

1230
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
We all know that

1231
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
The

1232
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
Stuff about

1233
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
Guns being able to advertise

1234
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,623
Is business-related private

1235
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
Industry

1236
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,743
Yes Google not allowing black kids is public

1237
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,047
Yeah they're very different

1238
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,095
Not for long

1239
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:16,191
Under estimating the quick

1240
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,263
Switch everything will be Phyllis a private business

1241
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
Philosophically and very sincerely

1242
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,591
Their differ

1243
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Yeah

1244
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,431
The day will come when they will be intertwined

1245
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
Just from

1246
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,647
Haha but it doesn't recognize false equivalence

1247
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,743
I don't know man I just don't like him

1248
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
I'm comparing him

1249
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Any kind of

1250
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
Civil rights

1251
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
Or just playing

1252
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,167
So sad

1253
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,591
Here we go

1254
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:58,175
If you walk down into the deep

1255
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Dark Waters

1256
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,039
If you want

1257
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Don't

1258
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,111
Cuz this next clip

1259
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,951
One of the worst things I've ever heard in my life

1260
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
You have all been

1261
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
Freed of empathy

1262
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,351
For Alex Jones because you need to hear this

1263
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Alright

1264
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Okay

1265
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,711
Great job

1266
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
I want to

1267
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Play

1268
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:47,071
Mmm Yeah

1269
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,375
He is promoting that feeling

1270
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,959
Play play these games with the with the terms

1271
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
Pamela basically runs the UN

1272
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,591
And they're so scared of getting caught now

1273
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
Normalize

1274
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
Weldon

1275
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,159
My 357 Magnum

1276
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
Little girls

1277
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
Family

1278
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:01,567
Somebody

1279
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,063
Little girls don't like seeing quotes

1280
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,839
In the shower on my daughters

1281
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:30,239
I will beat your brains out with my bare hands guaranteed

1282
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Boy oh boy

1283
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,039
Boy oh boy there's so much there

1284
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
And

1285
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,159
The first thing that we need to deal with is the

1286
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
False comparison

1287
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
Between

1288
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Pedophile

1289
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
That's number one

1290
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
Believing

1291
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,727
People want to shower with your little daughter

1292
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Is

1293
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:08,895
So f****** full of s*** f*** you every person that I know

1294
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,199
They're all wonderful people

1295
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,527
That I've met

1296
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,807
But nothing

1297
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
Stop immaturity

1298
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,111
You know what they are

1299
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:26,303
Hey you know how you don't want to go and f*** a little girl in the shower

1300
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
Your neighbor today

1301
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:33,983
And you know what else didn't want to shower with anybody a lot of them feel very uncomfortable in their bodies

1302
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
And they don't want to be around other people

1303
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,591
It's not about like throwing your dick around

1304
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,479
People are you mother f*****

1305
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
So he makes

1306
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
False comparison

1307
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,575
Yeah

1308
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,391
What if

1309
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
Which is

1310
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
Literally

1311
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,487
Threatening to murder people

1312
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
He does that

1313
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,119
And then

1314
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
He did

1315
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
What is that song

1316
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,007
Because he doesn't understand the disconnect between

1317
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,823
And someone who wants to hurt

1318
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,919
He thinks that they're the exact diagram is a circle

1319
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
And it's not

1320
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,247
Sweet

1321
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Catch you in the shower with my daughter I'll kill you

1322
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
No I agree with him

1323
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,439
But if someone was wagging his dick his daughter

1324
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,743
He's right to be angry about that

1325
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,471
The one thing that I find revealing

1326
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Is

1327
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,591
Like he was talking about how

1328
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:48,223
Tirol

1329
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,503
Does a child can hang out with

1330
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,783
Your child

1331
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,623
That's what you are Alex Jones

1332
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,695
Used

1333
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,255
Sound an awful lot like

1334
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
Child

1335
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:07,679
Your understanding of the world is very childlike year-old

1336
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
Child not

1337
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,799
Like words in his mouth

1338
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Play Red

1339
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
You're right but let's just hope he gets

1340
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Buy a truck

1341
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
No let's hope bore

1342
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,855
Financial hardships and truck

1343
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
F******

1344
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,951
Let's let's hope for all the success he thinks

1345
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Caesars

1346
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
I mean

1347
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,559
Does Delta

1348
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,863
Just genuinely think

1349
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,935
Free single prints

1350
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
They're pulling a scam

1351
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Is Joe

1352
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Tricka

1353
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,455
I think he thinks at least a large enough percent of Mr that

1354
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
You know

1355
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
It merits discussion

1356
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
That can't be real

1357
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,367
No reasonable person

1358
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,159
Well do use the word reason

1359
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,695
That's a good point

1360
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Okay

1361
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Because

1362
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,351
To me that's it

1363
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
If he's if he's

1364
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
Misrepresent

1365
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,263
This as an arm of trying to defend

1366
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Trump's nonsense

1367
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,359
He's if he's lying about the

1368
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
It's Pat

1369
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Give Trump

1370
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,455
Legitimacy for

1371
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Trump's Inn

1372
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,623
Sanity the North Carolina repealing of protections for transgender

1373
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
He's lying

1374
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
In order to kind of support

1375
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,999
Then

1376
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
Truly

1377
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
Truly deceptive and miserable

1378
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
Or

1379
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
He's telling the truth

1380
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
About believing this

1381
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
I don't know

1382
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,567
If I'm more or less

1383
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:55,711
Because if he's telling the truth in that kind of suggests that you could convince

1384
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,783
You could come up to him and

1385
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Hey

1386
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Let's talk.

1387
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,159
How about you and I go to because you just start yelling

1388
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
No I'm talkin literally like

1389
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
He and I

1390
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Go to a

1391
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
Go to a therapy

1392
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
Just go to a

1393
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,215
These are so important they used to be

1394
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,751
F****** Underground

1395
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
This is how important it is

1396
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,079
That trans people

1397
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
Have had to like go into

1398
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
To f******

1399
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,431
Places to talk to other

1400
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,991
Because they've been hunted and hated for

1401
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:29,759
You're so f******

1402
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,343
Pedophile

1403
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
Take him to

1404
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,463
Listen to those stories

1405
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,743
He's a man who

1406
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
He loves a good narrative

1407
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,583
If he actually listened to the stories

1408
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
Then

1409
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,143
He's telling the truth about believing

1410
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,959
Sort of redemption

1411
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
Impossible

1412
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,775
Cuz once you find out these are people

1413
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Then he'll grow and become a better person

1414
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,615
Even that don't never happen

1415
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Lying about

1416
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
Then he already knows

1417
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,271
And there's no there's no Redemption

1418
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:09,439
Evil evil man in the middle like I don't think he's fully aware

1419
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,279
But I think he knows that what he's saying is oversimplifying things

1420
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
I'm just trying to rile people up

1421
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
I think he's aware of that

1422
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
I don't think him knowing the truth would help

1423
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,215
You don't think so

1424
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,847
Readily available knowing the truth

1425
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:33,503
You don't even use it is really really available news from his own website

1426
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
But that's that's what I'm saying

1427
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Like

1428
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,415
The truth is readily available but it's not

1429
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Inform to him

1430
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,719
He doesn't know any trance

1431
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,999
People he doesn't need any Tran

1432
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,535
And people

1433
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,095
It's like it's like all of those

1434
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,655
All of these neural area

1435
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,495
Blacklivesmatter

1436
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
But if they actually

1437
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
Went to one of these places

1438
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
People in

1439
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
Added them to their community

1440
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
Instantly

1441
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,271
They would suddenly understand something very different

1442
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,831
Never do that

1443
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,439
You threatening to his financial position

1444
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,231
So then you just go from being an

1445
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
Fuct

1446
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
Demagogue

1447
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Evil

1448
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,887
Like how marketable is it to be reason

1449
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
It's not where we are.

1450
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,919
Set of our mouths.

1451
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,735
He thinks he's not being hateful

1452
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,039
He thinks he's not being hateful

1453
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,807
Yeah he is

1454
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,855
He thinks he's not saying he wants to

1455
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,159
Kilt

1456
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
With him

1457
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
Talking a little too much

1458
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
He's so good that

1459
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,407
Myself

1460
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:10,527
Because

1461
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,831
But I just said I can't believe it

1462
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
And now it seems like

1463
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:24,095
Telephone

1464
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
News for me

1465
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
Ears

1466
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:46,623
We all look at a 57 Chevy blue and white

1467
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,719
And it's the Emmett

1468
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,143
57

1469
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
Absolutely

1470
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
He's telling me what to think

1471
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,151
Play Martin call which we haven't

1472
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:15,551
Almost

1473
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,343
Also

1474
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Clean

1475
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,927
Like truly clean called 7-Eleven

1476
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:34,495
Either that or electricity cost

1477
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,223
Get your narrative straight about why businesses don't want to be here it

1478
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
The actual companies

1479
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,975
I think he's a Starbuck

1480
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:02,911
I think that's maybe our real win here with Alex

1481
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,959
Charlie Sheen

1482
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,775
Trump was a good guy

1483
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:12,895
The Russian television thing

1484
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,711
And then they invited me to give him a little

1485
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,527
Baltic

1486
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:22,879
I bet if we're successful and it really huge and we one day or like

1487
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
Alex Jones

1488
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,927
So f****** awesome

1489
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,511
He would love it

1490
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
X

1491
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,839
Have we have we considered

1492
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,863
The Grinch

1493
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Oh my God

1494
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,935
Have we considered

1495
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
Alright

1496
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
New York time

1497
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,823
Does not write a post

1498
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,615
It does not write an article

1499
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
Taking down Alex Jones

1500
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Yeah

1501
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,455
Deadwood

1502
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,015
Is praise His Showman

1503
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,831
Ignore the content altogether

1504
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,159
Does he suddenly like the New York time

1505
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,719
I think you might

1506
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Did that

1507
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Then

1508
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Is that how we

1509
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:07,679
Cure ourselves of Alex are we literally in a world where if

1510
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,727
Love conquered all

1511
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,543
It doesn't work that way with him

1512
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
For just a second

1513
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,712
On the show he does like a half hour interview with joy Zia

1514
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,552
It was that lady who wore a makeamericagreatagain dress

1515
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
Do the Grammys

1516
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:30,976
Great and her record sales interview with her about how great

1517
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,024
Everybody

01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
Biscuits

1519
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
What are albums

1520
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
I know idea

1521
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,104
What are

1522
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
He's following us

1523
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,024
Are these Infowars

1524
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:11,424
I thought

1525
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,984
Never never

1526
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,416
Tell me more about that

1527
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
2 years ago

1528
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:47,520
Where's the phone called on what

1529
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,712
The dinosaur

1530
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,584
Enemies

1531
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
Yes very interesting

1532
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
Annihilating

1533
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
Little girls

1534
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184
You again

1535
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,072
People enemy

1536
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,400
So you can keep saying he's going to play that clip throughout the

1537
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:49,472
The three hours I left doing never played even

1538
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Even in

1539
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
And his

1540
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,288
Recollection

1541
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,336
Greatest moment

1542
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
Trump is like

1543
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
Yeah

1544
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Store

1545
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,992
Interesting I got to go

1546
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,320
Does not realize that he's getting blown up

1547
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,648
You're telling

1548
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Too much hair

1549
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:11,488
Yeah because like if you do talk to Trump a bunch

1550
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
I imagine he doesn't want you saying

1551
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:19,936
If I were the president I wouldn't like this I would say this guy lacks decor

1552
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:25,568
I'm saying he's getting polonium poisoning this guy is not discreet

1553
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
So

1554
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,408
Attitude

1555
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Yeah

1556
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
So

1557
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:34,016
Maybe these calls happened

1558
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
If they did

1559
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,320
Again I think

1560
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:41,440
Now that I know Trump

1561
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,560
No I'm like

1562
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:55,008
Austin on Spotify.

1563
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,872
You know I got a man in my little other daughter's bathroom

1564
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:06,272
Are very prompt the man in his own locker room

1565
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
F******

1566
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:13,440
That guy that you're afraid of being in a

1567
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,232
Small girls locker room

1568
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
The president is that guy

1569
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
Too good.

1570
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,680
So good he actually it's physically

1571
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Play solid gold

1572
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,264
Alex talks about

1573
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,056
Where's all the money in the world going

1574
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,920
Almost all the wealth goes to

1575
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:38,016
Building

1576
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:43,136
Because most of the yachts and houses in real estate doesn't add up to

1577
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,184
Yes tell me what they're building

1578
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,232
Underground bases.

1579
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:53,632
You're so close

1580
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
World

1581
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:20,000
So you saying that a real building their building is just a metaphor for the metaphorical

1582
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,024
Yeah yeah

1583
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,400
That's pretty good if that is true

1584
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:30,752
That makes me giggle a little bit I'm on their side if I was going to build a building

1585
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,848
It would definitely be a metaphor for another building on building

1586
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
So f****** stupid

1587
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
It's insanely stupid

1588
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
He wasn't

1589
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,784
Sing

1590
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,600
Immediately so wrong on the thing

1591
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
He's right

1592
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
There's so much wealth

1593
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
And they're not using

1594
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
The Builder

1595
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,048
Just have a computer number

1596
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,912
A lot of it is just to secure generational wealth

1597
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,776
That is what it is

1598
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,080
Dynasty building essentially it's not

1599
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
It's not that they want to

1600
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,920
Build underground bases and get off the planet

1601
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,200
Or maybe some do

1602
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,296
Most people just want to create

1603
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:20,672
Built like

1604
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:27,072
Set my money on just now doing that are they crazy exactly

1605
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
Stupid

1606
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,912
Alex

1607
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
You're destroying it Billy

1608
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,432
Yeah that's

1609
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
People trying to

1610
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:53,440
Pretty homophobic

1611
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
Give them

1612
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:55,744
Magic

1613
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,608
We will work give you magic advice for Boone's Farm

1614
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,656
Avenue

1615
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,752
The next clip is about a media lies and also drift

1616
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:07,776
To homophobia

1617
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,336
Infowars is ready to take action

1618
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,248
I just I just right now in those the show Legion exist

1619
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:24,416
Scare people they can kill me tomorrow they can come tomorrow

1620
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,232
He's getting existential approach

1621
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,744
In between

1622
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,792
Grown men in the showers with her

1623
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,840
How many times

1624
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,656
50

1625
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
Telling you you're bad you're evil

1626
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,776
And you're watching come he's got me going

1627
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,896
The frogs are gay in Houston

1628
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:21,760
Play this stuff but my audience knows when I'm being serious I'm being serious

1629
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,344
Now it hasn't he spent

1630
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,624
So much try

1631
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,672
Blurring the lines

1632
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,464
Between when he's serious and when he's not

1633
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,096
So he can get away with so much b******* introduces a new

1634
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:42,240
Which is this is actually not even that segment

1635
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:48,640
We have another segment history

1636
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
Is full of s***

1637
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,200
When he says

1638
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,760
The my audience knows when I'm joking

1639
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,576
I have definitive proof

1640
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
The key

1641
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
Is a monster

1642
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,160
F****** liar

1643
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,952
Now consider these

1644
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,768
About Michelle

1645
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,632
A man actually doing the this is your life situation

1646
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:15,520
Urban Outlet

1647
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,592
Old man who is the guy who

1648
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
With mixer

1649
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,552
Is he going to be is he part of

1650
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,624
He doesn't

1651
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,208
Arguing that Michelle Obama is a man

1652
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:39,584
By the way this is a side issue I've always thought something was wrong with her

1653
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,632
Beautiful she has she looks

1654
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,424
Christian Lee

1655
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
Scary and monstrous to me

1656
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,920
And her shoulders are

1657
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,856
Kids on a male's shoulders

1658
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
Only another half

1659
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
That's a well-known

1660
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,376
Call an online video that I made

1661
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,192
Talk about Michelle Obama

1662
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,984
Looking like a man

1663
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,800
Only released photos of our weather

1664
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
Covering your shoulders

1665
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,616
Angle

1666
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,272
I've been here is it for years and I thought come on

1667
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:33,600
Obama was raised by transvestite Nebraska

1668
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,584
Look at photos over an official White House photo

1669
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,400
And she looks like an MBA Center

1670
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,008
I mean she looks more like Shaquille O'Neal in a black woman

1671
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:57,920
Call Raisa

1672
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,272
And then his dad clearly

1673
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,624
We saw the documentary

1674
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,160
You

1675
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,208
With the famous

1676
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,488
Pornography

1677
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:17,120
Grandfather's was best buddies with

1678
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,424
Famous communists

1679
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:29,920
My husband from Kenya we visited his place of birth and multiple videos into

1680
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,248
That's that's a lie but let's let's skip

1681
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,784
You know what that's a lie

1682
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:39,392
Tactful

1683
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,160
Nothing wrong with me

1684
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
Communist pornography

1685
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,000
I'm going to go on record

1686
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,840
Again don't care about that

1687
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,400
Prehnite

1688
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,960

1689
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,800
Go for it also his whole thing about

1690
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,384
Communist pornographer of dogs

1691
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,456
Not cool with that I've watched

1692
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:06,784
The Dreams of My real father were there any full of s***

1693
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
Based on a clip of

1694
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Michelle saying

1695
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,952
Talkin about HIV test

1696
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,536
And when they went abroad they publicly took

1697
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,936
He's always good to go to the homelander whatever Obama's home

1698
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:28,800
Campbell ship Michelle is

1699
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,224
I'm trying to prove a bigger point

1700
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
The smaller one

1701
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:42,880
Here's another another clip

1702
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
You

1703
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
Well Joan Rivers talked about in the last few days and it's a big International

1704
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,768
News story

1705
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,304
The question is

1706
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
Who is

1707
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,864
Michelle Obama

1708
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:56,704
Is she really a woman is to be a man

1709
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
No

1710
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,080
Michelle or Michael Obama

1711
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:08,480
Everytime I look at them something doesn't look like

1712
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:12,320
She doesn't look like any black woman or any woman I've ever known

1713
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:17,696
She's got shoulders that are wider than a man's which physiologically doesn't happen

1714
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,560
Three heads on a man's shoulders and only

1715
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,608
Two heads on woman shoulders

1716
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,400
Anatomy

1717
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,216
Women generally have wider hips

1718
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
The Mender

1719
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
She standing on

1720
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,360
She looks like no woman

1721
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,152
I have ever seen

1722
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,176
Except

1723
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,736
For people who have had different

1724
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,272
Chromosomal disorders

1725
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
Choose

1726
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:47,648
And I got the statistics of the numbers right here in front of me

1727
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,512
We're seeing more and more of these chromosomal disorders is all the toxic waste and GMOs

1728
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:57,120
That's been introduced one of them is they Klinefelter syndrome or the double

1729
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,656
Facts why

1730
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:03,008
Where you basically are parks

1731
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,080
Yeah can we just stop that

1732
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
Can we just never

1733
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,920
Naruto's seemed very serious

1734
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,712
He was making arguments

1735
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,272
He was referring to medical condition

1736
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:18,624
He implied that he talked to doctors about this now

1737
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,416
Now that was very much

1738
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Buried

1739
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,720
Now listen to this

1740
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,792
I want you to realize I'm not making this stuff up

1741
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,864
But that shouldn't even quasi joke around about

1742
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,400
Michelle being a tranny that was wrong

1743
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,448
And I'm not David attack

1744
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,544
End justifies the means I just get real cenacle in a bad mood

1745
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
Makes it jumps out of things

1746
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,176
F*** you

1747
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,040
Do you recognize what that is

1748
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,928
I was I'm making jokes

1749
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
Are not joke

1750
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:59,328
What is a I don't know it's like semi-formal wear

1751
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
Give me anything

1752
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,448
Situation where a quasi joke make sense

1753
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,496
Or just as a

1754
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,056
To say like what is it

1755
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,616
Joke

1756
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,944
Approximation of Pi

1757
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,248
What would that be

1758
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,552
It's not that

1759
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,832
And then you just stopped talking

1760
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,368
That's without jokes

1761
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:27,232
Is Janeane Garofalo of his

1762
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,096
He definitely doesn't have notes that he brings up on stage

1763
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:38,496
And the stuff about turning frogs gay

1764
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,544
Looks

1765
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:45,152
Nobody there is a clear example of him

1766
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,944
I met him claiming later

1767
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
I was joking

1768
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,248
Yeah no you can

1769
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,296
That again

1770
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
Locker rooms

1771
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
I was joking

1772
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:00,000
Everybody Talks

1773
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:06,400
Whatever that f*** you meant the segment has been called

1774
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,472
Amazing everything I just did

1775
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
You're busted

1776
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,592
Yourself

1777
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,408
I don't know

1778
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,992
Your part

1779
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,296
Check your checked baggage

1780
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,160
So

1781
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,720
We get it

1782
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,304
He says horrible horrible things

1783
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:37,120
I meant sometimes when you realize

1784
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,656
Jafar

1785
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
Coward

1786
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
Power

1787
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
That was

1788
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
Racist

1789
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544

Anytime

1793
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992

You can't leave that poor woman there are those moments but there was that one video of from the

The inauguration when he was looking at her dad's smiling and then he turned around and Melania immediately

1830
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,416

01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:27,616
I wish he raped his listeners

1836
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,176
He was like

1837
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:39,648
To his listeners

1838
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:46,048

01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,024
Until he talks about the idea

1848
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
People need

1849
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
Therapy

1850
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,848
Psychological issues

01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:40,064
I'm out here working out my psychological issues with you

1852
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,600
Young

1853
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,232
Ancestral memory

1854
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
Elegant.

1855
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:51,584
And I do not know what to do

1856
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,912
All I got was 80 years older than five

1857
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:03,104
I realize everything the globalist do with the block that

1858
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:08,480
Because whether you were little girl with your wife with your engine with your whatever you are

1859
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,832
You have all these instincts

1860
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,624
Call Discover.

1861
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:20,000
Okay

1862
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,072
Hello

1863
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,864
So he's

1864
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
He had ancestral memory

1865
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,008
Physically with that

1866
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,032
80 year old man

1867
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
Yes

1868
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,272
That's not him closet

1869
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
No

1870
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:49,184
A hundred percent

1871
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,232
He believes

1872
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,768
Young

1873
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,840
And the only reason that he doesn't raises

1874
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,424
80 year old man

1875
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,264
Richard Nixon about 120 now

1876
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,568
Yeah he is

1877
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,104
What is

1878
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:15,040
What is the weather they think about that now I want to listen to him tell his entire time I would love it

1879
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
He would be f******

1880
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
I would love it if one day on the show

1881
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,416
Instead of talking about news

1882
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:26,816
He just told his life story for 3 hours ever

1883
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:30,400
Because like this idea of this ant-like ancestral memory

1884
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:33,728
The idea that I was born

1885
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,544
If you think of it just as in

1886
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,360
Instincts and that we have ingrained things

1887
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
Like fear of

1888
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,408
Animals

1889
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,712
And predators in Africa

1890
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:48,064
Absolutely is ingrained into our DNA

1891
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:51,904
Seems to be implying is that he has access

1892
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,720
To some sort of wealth of knowledge

1893
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,768
People are privy to

1894
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
They are pretty

1895
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
Me too

1896
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
Yes

1897
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:06,496
Now we have to answer the question

1898
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,312
Is he right

1899
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,384
Know about the globalist

1900
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,176
Because

1901
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,736
He is now seeing the globulus ACT

1902
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,784
Very least

1903
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,576
100 120 years

1904
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,928
Can we vent that the eight-year-old man who

1905
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,696
I felt like as a

1906
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,464
The five-year-old

1907
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,512
The same thing happened to

1908
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:32,096
I think 100 years

1909
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
How far back does

1910
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,192
Just go I think the more likely Alex

1911
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,216
Jones meat

1912
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:41,056
Jesus that's the real question that that you're the person

1913
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
He does

1914
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,248
That the more possible and more likely

1915
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
Is he

1916
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,064
Paranoid delusion

1917
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:58,976
And has since he was a child

1918
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,768
Having a strong memory

1919
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:07,680
Is basically an admission of a mental illness that dates back to

1920
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,704
His number

1921
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,264
He thinks he's the kid from The Sixth Sense

1922
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
Basically

1923
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,336
Okay so

1924
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,152
There is whatever whatever psychiatrist

1925
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Psychologist

1926
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,968
Get together and talk about this

1927
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Like there's that

1928
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Trump has

1929
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Narcissistic

1930
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Personality

1931
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,160
It's been a rule sensor

1932
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,488
We don't publicly diagnose people who aren't our page

1933
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,096
It's hard to look at that and not be like oh do that dude

1934
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,376
Delusional

1935
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,752
Explain why

1936
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:45,824
He has to label everyone to Just Breathe him as having a

1937
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
Mental illness

1938
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,896
Because he is an untreated

1939
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,712
Mental illness

1940
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,736
He's the only one of him

1941
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
Yeah and

1942
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,064
Everyone used to be like me

1943
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:02,464
Episode

1944
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,192
So now we get to the clip that made me turn off the show I will give it this

1945
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
Lita

1946
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
He knows what he's saying

1947
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:20,128
I hope are you absolving him do

1948
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
Are you like

1949
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,688
Free

1950
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,784
His behavior there in some way

1951
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,344
Have to think that he doesn't know what he's saying

1952
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,904
Because if he does then we have to end

1953
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,672
The show

1954
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,464
We're going to cry all the

1955
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,744
No

1956
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,280
But he is

1957
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,608
Really on the cusp of legal

1958
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Okay

1959
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,912
He is going

1960
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,704
To say some things

1961
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,520
But I don't think are protected by the first

1962
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,056
Oh boy

1963
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,080
Let's say that

1964
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:56,736
And can we bring as evidence in his eventual position

1965
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:01,088
Subpoenaed so bad that would make my day so much

1966
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,880
Now what

1967
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,488
Wanting to put a bullet in the head of trans people

1968
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,072
He couch that in such a way that you can't

1969
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
Say

1970
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,144
You act

1971
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
Sibley assault

1972
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,704
Threaten to murder

1973
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,288
I think it's

1974
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,080
But he is

1975
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
Slippery enough

1976
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:26,432
It is within the range of what he's allowed to say

1977
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
Yeah you got

1978
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,248
He's got some wiggle room

1979
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,552
This is a little bit less

1980
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:32,576
Oh boy

1981
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
Less than

1982
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,976
Identifies with your brain

1983
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,000
Last

1984
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:45,632
A little direct okay and I also want to make it totally clear

1985
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
Still has not played that clip

1986
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Chris Cuomo

1987
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,056
Still talking about this clip at nauseam

1988
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,384
Bring it up over and over again but never playing it

1989
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,968
Because he knows if he plays it it doesn't say what he says it says

1990
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,552
Get ready

1991
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,600
Don't talk over this please

1992
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,904
Sorry just because it's baddieville

1993
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:11,232
Chris Como in Brazil

1994
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,352
I wonder if she's the problem or her overprotected until her dad teach tolerance

1995
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,400
Yeah you want to have a training

1996
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,960
With your daughter

1997
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,616
You should accept

1998
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,136
Maybe not baby

1999
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,208
Bro

2000
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:49,888
You're pro-life

2001
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,424
Jeffrey Katz

2002
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,832
10 year old

2003
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,160
So that's why they're the end but I think

2004
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,208
Did you catch what I'm talking about

2005
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,512
He has kids

2006
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Yeah

2007
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,840
I think we should tweet Adam and volunteer

2008
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,632
Yeah what

2009
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,168
Yeah

2010
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:25,216
He's encouraging people

2011
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,520
To harass Chris Cuomo

2012
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
About pulling their dicks out in front of his kids

2013
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,640
Literally what he saying

2014
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:33,664
He said that

2015
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,688
It was

2016
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,296
Now if he was nobody

2017
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,576
That would be horrible

2018
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,160
But he's someone who has dumb f****** listeners

2019
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:47,488
Who are known to attack people on social media

2020
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:51,072
That is one of the most irresponsible f****** things

2021
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,608
I have ever heard in my life

2022
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:56,960
Chris Cuomo about the situation

2023
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
He was saying

2024
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,288
Bet it is intolerant

2025
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:02,592
Do not allow trans people into the bathroom

2026
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,616
Of their identity

2027
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,920
He was not saying

2028
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,224
B A Daughter of some

2029
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
Hypothetical person

2030
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,552
Isn't

2031
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,088
That is not what he was saying

2032
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,624
That's misrepresenting it

2033
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,416
He's calling people to action

2034
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,952
Do something

2035
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,744
Even though it's only over Twitter

2036
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,048
That's still

2037
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,328
Probably illegal

2038
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,632
He said

2039
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,704
Go on Twitter

2040
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,264
Offer

2041
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Volunteer

2042
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,056
Volunteer

2043
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
And then

2044
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
He very

2045
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:42,016
Then let it was probably illegal

2046
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:43,808
It is

2047
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
To say to your audience

2048
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:52,512
Go offer this man sexually harassed his daughters

2049
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:56,096
And the only made that

2050
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:01,216
After he had confirmation that Chris Cuomo had kids

2051
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
F*** this

2052
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,080
S***

2053
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,360
Wow

2054
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
Army fatigue

2055
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
And then

2056
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,528
And then you have

2057
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,880
If you're saying that though

2058
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,416
Best to believe it

2059
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
He has to believe it

2060
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,024
If you genuinely believe

2061
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,072
Genuinely

2062
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:29,632
That the main goal of all of this

2063
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Trains except

2064
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,240
Get your daughters

2065
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,520
Into a bathroom

2066
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
I'm with a dude

2067
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,336
Yeah

2068
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,408
That's the only way you can just

2069
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Defy

2070
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Inside

2071
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,736
People to do that

2072
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:49,344
And I don't even think

2073
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
Is if his

2074
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,208
Nightmare hypothetical scenario about trans rights

2075
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,256
If that were the truth

2076
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,792
What do you think

2077
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,096
No

2078
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:06,496
The answer is not it's not it's not it's not if your kid is getting

2079
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,520
Pedophile

2080
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,824
Pedophile somebody else's kid

2081
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,128
But never been there

2082
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,712
How that works

2083
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,040
He's also sort of implying that his audience would like

2084
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:25,440
To do that cuz he said we should call him and volunteer

2085
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,976
In the first place

2086
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,768
You f****** filthy Spock

2087
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,304
Call him and volunteer

2088
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,096
2

2089
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,424
So it's time somebody

2090
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
He taught you a lesson

2091
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
Fight hurting your child

2092
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,336
Which it really sounds like someone who cares about you

2093
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,872
Certainly

2094
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,176
It has a grasp on the issues

2095
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:50,784
I just spent over raise my children to not be a jerk

2096
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,576
Yeah by being the biggest

2097
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,856
F****** jerk in the world

2098
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,624
What a f***

2099
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,392
Monster

2100
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:01,536
And that's why I turn this off

2101
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,840
There's just no way that you can

2102
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
No

2103
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
You can

2104
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,728
Now

2105
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:14,848
Just make sure we're not we're not

2106
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,128
Listen with

2107
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:19,200
Second time around

2108
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:22,016
Okay

2109
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,344
Every time that Alex Jones wants to play on your sympathy

2110
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,136
A

2111
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,928
Play this clip in your head

2112
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,744
Chris Como empezar Twitter

2113
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:36,864
I wonder if she's the problem or her overprotected intolerant dad teach tolerance

2114
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,192
You want to have a training

2115
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:44,032
With your daughter and you don't like it so you're intolerant

2116
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:48,128
You should

2117
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,648
Maybe not baby

2118
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,720
Bro

2119
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,400
You're pro-life

2120
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,936
Jeffrey Katz

2121
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:34,464
This represents a tall guys

2122
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,232
Open contacts

2123
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
Okay

2124
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,792
This is what this is

2125
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,584
Stephen Colbert talking about

2126
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
Go ahead

2127
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,984
Okay I'm trying I was trying to write down as much shorthanded like

2128
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,520
1

2129
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
Say the word

2130
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,920
Missive

2131
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,944
He doesn't

2132
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:01,344
He does it the same way Milo does as if it's taking up her free speech I will not allow myself to be language

2133
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,648
Police

2134
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
F*** you

2135
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,536
In the shower with your daughter

2136
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,072
How about a guy who poses

2137
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:11,840
Is Johnson out

2138
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,632
Part-time employees

2139
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,288
Dad said you're pro-life get out

2140
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,592
I think that's what Mario Cuomo

2141
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,616
How about

2142
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,152
Volunteer that

2143
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,432
Yeah I think

2144
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,456
I think what he

2145
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,736
He was saying there

2146
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,016
Is

2147
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,320
How about we volunteer your daughters

2148
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,112
To get

2149
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,416
F***** in

2150
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,184
In the bathroom

2151
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:40,256
Even if that's The Interpreter

2152
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:42,048
I think that's what he

2153
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:43,840
Because I

2154
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
I think

2155
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Kids in p***

2156
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,472
At the age of 12

2157
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,008
Which is also

2158
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
Crazy

2159
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:56,896
Yeah I think I don't know where he pulled back from I think I think what he saying is that

2160
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,432
If

2161
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,992
Here's what I here's what I think he's saying

2162
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,344
I actually I think I might disagree with you on this

2163
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
Okay

2164
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:08,160
Think what he's saying there is

2165
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,464
If we allow these trends

2166
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,000
If we allowed transfer

2167
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,280
People to go into the bath

2168
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,096
That their gender is

2169
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,376
That they associate

2170
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,144
Their gender

2171
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,680
Then

2172
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,008
Cuomo's kids should go first

2173
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,592
I don't think so

2174
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,360
To go in

2175
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,944
Strangers can do that by Twitter

2176
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:39,136
Twitter why do we need a volunteer

2177
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,488
I know it is a little bit is what exactly

2178
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:48,608
Even if your argument is correct

2179
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,424
At least

2180
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,216
Harassed harassed

2181
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
His children

2182
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,544
Even the show new

2183
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:04,736
That's like Oscar said it was going to go down I have to assume

2184
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:13,440
Lucas self in the middle of it

2185
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,976
You better get him recognizing

2186
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,072
He has to go down that road

2187
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
Ocean

2188
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,424
I guarantee

2189
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,728
Did some people

2190
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,008
Cuidate Chris Cuomo

2191
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,848
I guarantee it

2192
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,664
Coward Alex Jones

2193
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:37,248
If this ever turns into something

2194
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
Yep

2195
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,904
Now this is unfortunately the sort of thing that

2196
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,672
We end up having

2197
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
Undercover sometimes

2198
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,536
It's so much more fun when we can just laugh and goof around but

2199
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:52,608
This is also a reality

2200
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,888
This is the thing

2201
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:56,192
About his show and this show

2202
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:59,264
That does put everything I've ever known about him

2203
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,848
Before we started doing this

2204
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,408
The the same like

2205
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,456
Adjustable headlight

2206
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:10,016
Alex Jones has this crazy

2207
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,856
At no point

2208
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,672
Is anybody really dead

2209
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,208
Level oven

2210
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:20,256
Yeah cuz this is 8

2211
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,304
Truly cruel person

2212
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,352
And that you're not putting up his

2213
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Rules

2214
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:27,936
They're putting up the headline generating nonce

2215
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:32,800
As cruel as cruel as Sandy Hook

2216
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,664
Sibley tell people to go

2217
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Rape

2218
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,224
Children

2219
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,784
Either

2220
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:43,808
Literally

2221
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
Right

2222
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
Yeah I mean

2223
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,160
This is the part where were

2224
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:50,976
Like the idea you can say like

2225
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:57,888
Questions about the way he did

2226
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,936
Because if you presented as a fake

2227
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:01,728
All of those people are

2228
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,032
Write in the same way

2229
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:07,616
Look Chris Cuomo's a f****** monster and I don't want Dixon

2230
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,640
Showers

2231
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,408
It's okay

2232
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:11,200
You can make that argument

2233
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:13,248
I'm still be on Solid Ground

2234
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,064
Yeah once you get into this territory of

2235
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,600
He always

2236
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,952
That sort of thing you can no longer say that you don't have a part

2237
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,096
Is there a paralegal

2238
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,376
Is that

2239
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,424
Where are we at

2240
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,752
I want to know what that is because

2241
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,544
Is it it reminds me of

2242
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
It's not this particular thing

2243
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:41,664
But the thought that I just had was the the woman who tweeted so

2244
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,432
Something about

2245
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,016
Forgot something about HIV

2246
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,576
Honor Flight

2247
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:52,928
Got off the flight and was he had no job and everybody was saying

2248
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:54,720
Destroy them

2249
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,512
That was some organic

2250
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,072
Weird internet just

2251
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,608
Just thing that happened

2252
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:06,496
Great guys we ruined one ladies life on Twitter

2253
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,800
Awesome we're all heroes now

2254
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,616
But that wasn't anybody

2255
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Direct

2256
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:13,920
Is it

2257
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:18,784
Weather outside

2258
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,088
Right now it's against the law to

2259
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,160
Get up in front of a large group of people and tell them to go burn

2260
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Yes

2261
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,000
Does that apply to Twitter

2262
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:34,656
I don't know it's it's it's sort of a gray area I know that apparently wasn't illegal him

2263
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
In Tacoma

2264
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Comet Ping Pong Pizza

2265
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:39,264
Right

2266
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,872
And when he was inspired by

2267
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:44,896
That's

2268
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,688
The same thing is

2269
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:49,248
Not necessarily the same thing but

2270
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,088
Lenny told me to kill my

2271
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:57,440
But I'm saying that he literally said that people someone should check out that

2272
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,488
Third Bank

2273
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:07,936
You should check out at checkout

2274
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:14,336
If I could check out the pizza place cuz they make great pizza and somebody showed up with a gun saying that I Inspire them to go there

2275
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,408
Boys the same thing

2276
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:20,480
But it says the checkout contacts kind of work there

2277
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,552
This was very specific

2278
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,856
This one's very wrong

2279
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
I don't like this

2280
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,720
I'm not sure like I said I don't know if it's illegal I do think that you

2281
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,024
Really on the cusp of what free speech

2282
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:33,792
Protect

2283
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,560
Because

2284
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,584
Slander

2285
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:37,120
Threats of violence

2286
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,400
Those things aren't protect

2287
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,424
Under priest

2288
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,216
Those are still crimes

2289
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,008
And I don't know if

2290
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,032
Technically can

2291
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,080
Construed as a

2292
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
The threat

2293
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,872
But man it feels

2294
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,408
Yeah

2295
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,760
You don't then f****** ice

2296
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,528
I mean it this

2297
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,088
Time

2298
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,624
You're starting

2299
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,352
Threatening

2300
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,912
Good

2301
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:15,776
The Comeback you always forget as much as I could

2302
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,312
Stomach February 20

2303
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,080
24th

2304
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,872
On the Alex Jones program

2305
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,408
I can't imagine a better

2306
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,944
Hahaha

2307
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:26,528
With him

2308
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,808
Apologizing

2309
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
I'm saying that

2310
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
We should all be

2311
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,368
Tolerance

2312
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,904
And he started raising his list

2313
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
I'm sure of this

2314
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,768
Have to be Redemption

2315
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,536
This is

2316
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,328
Classic Joseph Campbell

2317
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:45,728
Hero's journey away from me I'm so sorry about that

2318
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:47,520
You know sometimes I get

2319
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,592
I was joking

2320
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,616
This time I was

2321
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,152
Sincere and then I

2322
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:53,920
I realized

2323
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,200
What my

2324
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
My beliefs were wrong

2325
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,528
Grown

2326
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:02,880
I'm a better person that's one possibility or other possibilities became back

2327
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,648
And sold bone

2328
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,304
Possibly more likely

2329
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:17,472
Anyway f*** you Alex Jones suck you like this very hard for me to sit through

2330
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:21,568
Underscore

2331
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:28,224

2332
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392

2333
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:40,256
Prince was talking to the logos that people have been making

2334
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,536
For us all of this stuff is

2335
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:46,400
Has been very heartening keep them coming the way that we did

2336
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:51,776
It wasn't our choice

2337
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:55,360
You could have left us alone in this world where we believe he's fun and fancy free

2338
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:58,432
Yeah I would not be accurate reporting

2339
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:04,832
