00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
Alexa Duran works by the author of Alex

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
Dude

00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
Quick question for you

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Switch price

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
Is it the best spookiest of all days

11
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
We're recording is on Halloween

12
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
You can't hear this because because we're recording this

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Audio thing but I'm in full costume

14
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
I'm Frankenstein's monster

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
We're just hitting the Warriors going for it and we got together to record this podcast around

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
A lot of wasted effort but

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Feels good

18
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
You know it's funny he was a little bit like

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
The Gift of the Magi thing I told you not to wear costume when you told me not to be both trainings other

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
I like

21
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,016
I like Halloween is much as I like any other holiday

22
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
I've always had a

23
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Dottie is not good

24
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
To be surprised to hear this

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
A softball for candy

26
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,000
Is the candy based holiday and

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
I'm thrilled for that.

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,632
I'm excited for tomorrow the TV on sale

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,496
And unlike the other candy holiday Valentine's Day you don't have to enjoy anyone else

30
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
There's no exit

31
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Dictation if you want to just turn off your your porch light you don't have to worry if I say anything to anyone

32
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
Possibility to give these kids can't even bother yourself

33
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Bibarel

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
I thought Halloween was evil

35
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
So we would legit

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Shut off

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
All of our lights

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm going to a

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
Backroom so no one could stop by and tricks

40
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,888
Yeah I know that this is well-trod territory and probably even a little bit haky but I really

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
They hated the guy down the

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Street who would like

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Act like a corpse

44
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,128
On his board oh yeah you totally

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Probably yeah I remember the

46
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Exactly

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Have to that guy's house

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
From my house

49
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
I like

50
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Know what would you get out of there

51
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,928
I guess he gets the knowledge that he is

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,304
Hundreds of children literally to the point where they remember the pathway to his home

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
83077 bill

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Feel like I got to avoid that

55
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,288
F*** that guy

56
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
Recently got to the new James Blake album it came out

57
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Few weeks ago

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Fantastic

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
It might be his

60
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
His best album

61
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
No James Blake he's like he's a British dude who does what you would call like almost over

62
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Are you know like imagine

63
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Pure tones

64
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Voice

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
Never really slow down dub music

66
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Okay

67
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
Very strange here in words

68
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Really good

69
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
It's really good

70
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Describe but it's really good

71
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,040
To describe it I also would need you to find them

72
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
D'Angelo

73
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Sure

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
It's one of the greatest songs ever

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
Define

76
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Alright

77
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,399
Jordan today we are checking in on October 29th 2020

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
It is you know it

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
It's Friday's episode from my last week

80
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Where the present

81
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Let's look into it it

82
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
It's kind of like me

83
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,247
Why are behind my back where twisted my arm but I want have a Spooktacular

84
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
Halloween Spooktacular

85
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
But here we are in the present day

86
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
We'll just have to live with it

87
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
New I walked out there

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Do first

89
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,655
Jordan ever mentioned by mail bag gift of green Russian soda I hope it was still enjoyed

90
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
I think it was

91
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
I received a recall

92
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Sorry about that

93
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,527
Bill from Toronto got a nice message from Bill from Toronto it turns out

94
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
I heard about the show from a neighbor

95
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
That's community

96
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
We're talking about never considered that a neighbor might give me any recommendations or anything

97
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,143
Toronto and rarely your neighbor

98
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,983
I'm a policy wonk working on the railroad

99
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
Thank you so much and I'll probably walk

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
All the livelong day

101
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
To follow up with

102
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Remarkable restraint

103
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
So I think I'm going to probably butcher the

104
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Pronunciation

105
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Next

106
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Make an assassin

107
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
It's a belief listen

108
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
That's kind of thing but

109
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
Magnificent magnificent

110
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
You're not about to walk

111
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
I'm a policy wonk

112
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
To the shoutouts

113
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Lizzie bones

114
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Thank you so much

115
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,967
Happy belated birthday present clay thank you so much you are now what time

116
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Democrat

117
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
How's your 401k

118
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
What's the business

119
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Money off that heroin

120
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Sneaky

121
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,455
Hey Thursday there's always a loophole anytime we try and close one door they open a window

122
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Yeah I mean I was really committed

123
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,063
To the Ole thing of no more birthday shout out but it turns out

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
You're a traitor

125
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,463
God no

126
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
This Is the End

127
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
Table into a miserable druid

128
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
Start the beginning of the episode

129
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Some covid related news

130
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
I wanted to show you this whole stack this morning

131
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
This is just today

132
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Local newspaper

133
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Doctors remember

134
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Or telling you to remember

135
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Nobody

136
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Western world

137
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
They say we don't know why an NPR stories and

138
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
ABC stories

139
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
These others just say it's just a new saying just get used to

140
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Strokes

141
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Blood clots in lungs

142
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
No one knows what it is

143
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Yes

144
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
So this is a headline Metallica's reading from

145
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,807
The times of India not from local papers all over the United States

146
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
He's entirely misrepresenting the point of the Arctic

147
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,463
Alex wants this to be something related to covid vaccine side effects

148
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
That's not what the article is actually even

149
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
About at all

150
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,167
This is borderless an op-ed about the fact that while we often think of heart attacks or something would only affect older people

151
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Younger folks do chameleons

152
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
And heart conditions to just at a lower rate

153
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
General reason cited

154
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Nothing to do with vaccine

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,943
Quote well conventionally vices were blamed for hurting

156
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Youth in their twenties and thirties today face the risk of

157
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Developing heart disease

158
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Due to their sedentary lifestyle stress and diet

159
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,463
If you read the art added pollution but I'm going to guess the timesofindia doesn't want to add that

160
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
Throw that interview like if you read the articles

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Discussion is not about a phenomenon where

162
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Justine sencakova

163
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,775
In the last seven and a half years ago a medical college has treated about 7400 hard page

164
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,151
Of these 4.1% were less than 40 years of age and 21% under

165
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
This article even discusses the

166
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
This is an issue that

167
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Particularly more severe in

168
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Amigo area in

169
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
When India because

170
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
A high incidence of diabetes among

171
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
The Goan population

172
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Could be one of the reasons why more people in there you there

173
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Detected with heart

174
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
The reality is just that even

175
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
Before covid vaccines were a thing that we knew it exists or even

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Covid-19 we do it exist

177
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
The rates of heart attacks and young people were on the rise

178
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Although Americans are suffering fewer heart attacks as a whole

179
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
The rate of heart attack

180
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
It's for people under 40 is in

181
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Increasing

182
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,271
That was from a Cleveland Clinic article published on April 26th

183
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
2019

184
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,183
The article discusses many of the same variables as I timesofindia article sedentary lifestyles

185
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,255
Compounded issues of diabetes and increases in general stressing

186
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Hmong population

187
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
This is just a subject that the medical community is

188
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Disgusting and paying

189
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Super gyro

190
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
I want to just take it headlines that reflect

191
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
The long-standing

192
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
The concern and lying about them

193
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
To use them as a weapon in Atlanta back

194
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
All of a sudden people have been studying this thing for the past several 5710 years

195
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
I have started

196
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
Saying things like pay attention to it and

197
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Is it by minutes

198
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Covid

199
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Obviously

200
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
Discovery but yeah

201
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Great

202
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,839
Has more on this headline FM he digs even deeper

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Into a sad hole

204
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Sad reported holes

205
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
World

206
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783
Dallas and it's on the side of the buses there

207
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Doctors remember

208
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
My body's too young

209
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
Weather report all of the western world

210
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Spotted

211
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
In wit by

212
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Durham Transit

213
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Normalizing this

214
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,919
So Alex on a meme that one of his employees on Twitter

215
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Who's the picture of a boss with it

216
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
The cow on the side saying quote

217
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Kids have strokes

218
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
To know the warning

219
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
King science

220
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,903
This has a caption that Alex was reading that was added to the image

221
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Spotted in Whitby on Durham Transit

222
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
Are they normalizing on WhatsApp

223
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
To come

224
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
So the argument is that like more kids are going to have

225
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Strokes that normal

226
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
So if I understand correctly

227
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Somebody

228
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Probably

229
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
In Whitby

230
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Globalist

231
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
Took a picture of a complete on globe

232
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Anak

233
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Haha

234
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Health is

235
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Important

236
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,623
And then turned it into a right-wing meme to disparage the covered backs

237
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
Tell everybody they're going to die or allow Google

238
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
Text to demonstrate their telling you the kids have strokes

239
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Books in order

240
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
To make you not worried when

241
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Kids do have stroke

242
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
Yeah they can just turn anything into bulshit Gap

243
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
This is bulshit for a couple of hours

244
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
The first is that this picture that's used in the mammoth

245
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Is undated

246
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
So honestly who's to say if it's even a recent image

247
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Could have been at the cow that was run for a public health campaign in

248
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
2017

249
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
For all we know

250
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
The second reason is that bad

251
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Include the link

252
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Two people who paid

253
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
For the add

254
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
It's an organization called achieving Beyond brain in

255
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Injury

256
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
This group was started by two mothers who mad because their sons

257
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Had Strokes early in life

258
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Advocacy and awareness

259
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
This group to help other parents who were in The Situation

260
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
They were in

261
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
And how parents know the warning signs as the bus

262
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Rustic outside

263
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Rebecca De Manos son was 14 when he had a stroke

264
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
On April 12th

265
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
2018

266
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
The bean Vermillion son was 10

267
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
When he had a stroke

268
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
On February 28th

269
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
15

270
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Along with raising awareness Amtrak to help families with

271
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
Children affected by Strokes the organization is really about the bigger picture of you two of supper

272
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Brain related injury

273
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,631
For instance many of their scholarship recipients this year had trauma-related brain injuries like

274
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Who was hit by a bus

275
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,543
Strokes in young people it's not a new phenomenon and the work these mothers are trying to do with

276
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Really admirable stuff

277
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Because there's a very important variable that's brought up in this

278
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
2015 article in the

279
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
The journal vascular health

280
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
And risk man

281
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
Strokes in young adults are reported as being uncommon

282
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Comprising 10 to 15% of all stroke

283
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
However

284
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Compared with Strokes in

285
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
An older adults

286
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Stroke in the young has discs

287
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
Fortunately large

288
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Economic impact by leaving victim

289
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Disabled

290
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Before their most productive

291
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Debeers

292
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Anyway this organization dedicated to helping

293
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,103
Make sure the children who suffered injuries don't get left behind they put an ad on a bus

294
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Canada

295
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,223
Somebody took a picture of it which is now being used as Auntie covid vaccine propaganda

296
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Repulsive behavior from top to bottom

297
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
And the transmission

298
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Alex

299
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Reporting on this meme without any context about the organization

300
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
The put the cowl on the bus

301
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Incredibly irresponsible

302
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Just disrespect

303
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
The all-around

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah you know sometimes when they're inventive

305
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Kind of

306
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Have fun or interesting

307
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
In this situation this is just

308
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
F******

309
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Sad

310
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Yeah

311
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
All across the board

312
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Everybody doing things is

313
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
Sport station is sad lazy everything

314
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Yeah this is awful

315
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,415
The group allegedly behind this billboard is from all indications

316
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
I'm doing really important work

317
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
And the only end result

318
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
This is Maybe

319
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Targeting them

320
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
Is being part of a conspiracy to normalize stroke

321
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Yeah you killed

322
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Two birds with one stone

323
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
You know you get to make a conspiracy and then you get to bother people who are doing good

324
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
That's pretty disgusting Wing wants all the

325
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Pretty disgusting

326
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
I recently

327
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
I know maybe maybe it's cuz of covid

328
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
I know everything's okay

329
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Publication the second-most

330
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Populous country in the world

331
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Rajkumar

332
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,143
Very popular 80's movie star over there in Bollywood

333
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,775
The covid-19 vaccine

334
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
He's doing fine pugs

335
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Valley.org

336
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
46 years old

337
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
What

338
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Weird

339
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Really

340
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Odd way to Enzo it is

341
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Set the passenger

342
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
Puneeth Rajkumar is a sad bit of news

343
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
Popular actor in only 46

344
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Six when he died for

345
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
From a heart attack

346
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Alex is lying and making s*** up and Order

347
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
To use this dead man's memory is a prop

348
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
For his anti-vax propaganda

349
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,615
Easy pretty thrash tomorrow's a huge star so it struck me as a little weird to imagine that he was

350
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Just now getting this

351
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
He's also really public face for healthy living

352
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Things this didn't sit right with me at all

353
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
If you look into this for

354
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Even a second

355
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
You'll find that he got his first dose of the vaccine

356
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Seen on April 7th

357
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
2021

358
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
I know this because he

359
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Tweeted a picture of himself

360
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Getting vaccinated

361
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,351
I don't let you can't believe screenshots like that we just said there was it was there a date on there

362
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,959
5 minute had to have been prior to April 7th

363
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Time travel alright well now we're talkin

364
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
I also know that by June Denise was helping the Indian

365
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
By peering and psa's about the

366
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
The importance of Public Health measures

367
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Including getting vaccine

368
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
I guess I can't

369
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
Definitively prove when he got his second dose but Alex

370
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Is presented no evidence

371
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
And he's expecting me to believe that one of the highest paid actors in India

372
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
At the first shot in

373
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
April then work to the vex

374
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Collision awareness ambassador

375
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
And somehow didn't

376
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Get the second dose

377
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Until late

378
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
October you get busy

379
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
You get busy Dan that's safe life

380
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
Also small point but not every movie Made in India is a Bollywood movie

381
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
Bollywood tends to refer to the movie industry in Mumbai which is

382
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Was formerly known as Bombay

383
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Bombay Hollywood makes Bollywood

384
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,135
Pretty thrash Camaros from the south of India is more associated with the kannada movie

385
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
Who's that insane

386
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
The other thing that he was known for

387
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Was being the son of the

388
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Sanely famous actor Dr Rajkumar

389
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
He was an actor but he went by doctor

390
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
And incidentally

391
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
He died of a heart attack

392
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
Attack which illustrates the family history of factor for

393
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Who needs to have

394
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
Higher incidence of higher likelihood of having a heart attack

395
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,503
Seems like there are many many many explanations

396
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
0 of them are the vaccine

397
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:32,415
Alex is a monster he's willing to make s*** up about people who died as long as the story there.

398
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Profit off of

399
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
The real piece of s***

400
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
Real piece of s***

401
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
This is Harsh at the gate yet

402
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Worse

403
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Oh hey

404
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
That's just

405
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Legend ice

406
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Every second shot

407
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
It's not even anecdotal is just not

408
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
True

409
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Is lying about another beloved celebrities death in order to make

410
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Cuz shity argument better

411
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
In this case is Australian broadcaster Russell wolf

412
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Who died in his sleep on October

413
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
At this point I don't believe

414
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
That the exact cause of death

415
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Is public or noun

416
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
So I can't really speak to

417
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
To that

418
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
Anti-vax protesters of used wolf staff as an argument against

419
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
The vaccine

420
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
You shut up

421
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Wolf himself

422
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Tweeted that he got the SEC

423
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
AstraZeneca vaccine

424
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Being on August 9th

425
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Over two months prior

426
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
His passing

427
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
There's no evidence at all

428
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Vaccinations are related in any way this is just

429
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Disgusting

430
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Stuff

431
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
I'm listening to this episode of the Mike

432
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
I want to kick the Epis

433
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
Yeah man that's

434
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
That's

435
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
I have to do that

436
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
I don't know

437
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
It's like you intellectually I know he

438
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
He's a narcissist

439
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
6 Psychopaths

440
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Who has

441
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
No care for others

442
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
It's just him

443
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Right

444
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Like

445
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
Emotionally get into a place where I'm like you know what I'll do

446
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
I'll lie about this person

447
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Death

448
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Yeah kill more people

449
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
Alex Fields someone lied about like what is love

450
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
Just after something like that

451
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Spurious argument

452
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Just the roots repulsive Behavior

453
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
And you know what

454
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
I was experiencing this and I'm like

455
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Time window Davis

456
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Spooktacular

457
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Is pretty sure

458
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Not long

459
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
I mean like even this episode is coming out in November

460
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
I might be able to release this episode a little bit earlier so some people can listen to it on the Halloween infection

461
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Nighttime Halloween Magic

462
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Adult

463
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Maybe some people who don't have kids

464
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
They might want to enjoy your Halloween on the Monster Mash and

465
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Episodes

466
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Simultaneously they sync up at

467
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
It's Pink Floyd all over

468
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Starbucks

469
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Is the point where

470
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
If I was a professional I would add a lightning sound effect

471
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
So I was creeping around on Alex's website

472
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
Through like old screenshots on the way back

473
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Machine in the archives

474
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
And I found an interview that is long buried

475
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
I've never

476
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
Seen this before it is Page

477
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Is almost done

478
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
Accessible

479
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
This is an interview with a guy named David Benoit

480
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Here's the title of the interview

481
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Author of 40

482
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Teen things witches hope

483
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,807
Parents never find out about the occult and the real meaning of Halloween bringing America to its knees

484
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Well Dan

485
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879

486
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,975

29

488
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Holyshit

489
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Good God you are really getting me scared

490
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,703
I know it was a Spooktacular for me

491
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
To Halloween

492
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
2002

493
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
October 30th

494
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Twilight 2002

495
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
We have

496
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Alex Jones

497
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
Having an interview with a guy who's written a book

498
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
About the 4th

499
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
13 things witches don't want you to know

500
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Exactly what

501
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
H49

502
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,744
Can I actually disabuse you of that notion

503
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,912
Come on

504
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
Here's where Alex begin

505
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
The preceding

506
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Every time I follow one of their rat holes

507
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
I find

508
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:59,936
Now we see David and California the Aztec holiday of human sacrifice with black Alters

509
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
Putting worship we hear about these different

510
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Meanwhile

511
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Don't

512
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Talk about Jesus

513
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Yeah man

514
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
You can't evangelize it's

515
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
School or you can

516
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Yeah

517
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
I mean when I was in

518
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
In school they have alike

519
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Meet you at the flag

520
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Anything you know where I was

521
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Is quite a bit of it.

522
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
The other school is

523
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Isn't it supposed to have like

524
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
Coordinated organized religious

525
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Activities

526
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
New World Order

527
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,200
Oh yeah you know I was going to say that he shouldn't bring Christianity into it

528
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,040
Because Christianity seems to be the one trying to terrify people about imaginary witches

529
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Is where is witches or

530
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Actually do magic

531
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
We don't know that

532
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
Harry Potter is a guidebook

533
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
Why would

534
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
Probably actually be a little bit

535
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Uncomfortable doing

536
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Episode

537
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
If we had made some progress

538
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
December 2003

539
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
A little bit more of that

540
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Then he doesn't the president

541
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah and we also know that

542
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
F****** things

543
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
The Harry Potter and witches are real

544
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,488
Sew in with those pieces of information we can now do this

545
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Is Halloween

546
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,864
Interview I wish this whole episode was available but it

547
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,008
Unfortunately

548
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Feel about Geddy Lee

549
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Sprite feel about

550
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Rush you know like

551
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,920
Robbie moored specifics on who's the devil

552
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
Devil worship center Prague

553
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
They're less rock and roll wild frog

554
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,624
Everybody was at the Prague is a weirdo

555
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
What

556
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Videos with prove

557
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
They worship the devil in Subway

558
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,264
Sure Limelight all about the dog

559
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
I will put a bed again

560
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
I will choose free will

561
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Alex loves free will

562
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
Yeah but soda

563
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Is the devil

564
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
We wouldn't be able to

565
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
Follow the devil if it weren't for free will

566
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Good point

567
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
That is a good point.

568
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
David Benoit

569
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Today

570
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Am I

571
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
And that we got

572
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
Halloween

573
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Day of Samhain

574
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,512
I Am 1000 years ago

575
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
I don't I don't know if

576
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
That all the tradition

577
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
1000 years ago

578
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Continue to

579
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
Anyway I was curious about

580
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
David Benoit

581
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,336
Look into him

582
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Okay

583
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
In June of 1984 David was lead of the Lord

584
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Went David began

585
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
Glory Ministries list exposed

586
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
Truth of the damaging effects of rock music on society

587
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,024
The only solution being regeneration by Jesus Christ

588
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Mad he was only a

589
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
A few years away from correctly hating rap music

590
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
What's so fun about that backstory is it

591
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Really

592
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,848
This is June 1984 so we can definitely tell what was on the charts back then

593
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
How is the music industry's really into themselves today they leave a lot of evidence

594
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,088
84 I-10 84

595
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
25-count think so

596
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,744
The three songs made it to number one on the charts in that month alright

597
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
You're never going to be able to go

598
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Let's Hear It for the Boy

599
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
From the Footloose soundtrack

600
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,384
The Footloose soundtrack. Let's Hear It for the Boy

601
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
Not even

602
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Denise Williams

603
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,856
After Time by Cyndi Lauper

604
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
The Reflex

605
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Spider and Duran

606
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Satanic so maybe you should look at

607
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
It may cuz maybe it was like what happened it may cause him to

608
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
To jump off of the lakes in June

609
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
In the chart every week

610
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
You know

611
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
You probably has a sense of

612
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,800
It may hear the things that made it to

613
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Number one was making waves with

614
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Hello oh that's great

615
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,504
Later on uses a hook for one of the best Busta Rhymes songs

616
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Give me some out

617
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
Collins was the world on fire doing

618
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
3 weeks

619
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:13,792
To the top of the charts with against-all-odds Jesus Christ I'm going to be honest

620
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
I don't like Phil Collins

621
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
I do but

622
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
I believe we can agree to disagree

623
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Who can sign decided to look at

624
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,288
The entire Hot 100 from the week's relevant to this possible conversion and

625
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Here are the songs that I

626
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,664
Are possible that made David into a devil fever

627
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,832
Sister Christian by Night Ranger

628
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
I want to break free by Queen

629
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Because Freddie Mercury is gay

630
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
Yeah but I mean that's just too good

631
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
Even and even in the 80s

632
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
Is everybody hated gay people but they're like

633
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Freddy f***

634
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,680
Can mercury or David the kind of guy who could be afraid of a lot

635
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
The only other one I could think of

636
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
Maybe

637
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,568
And that's the heart of rock and roll by Huey Lewis and the News

638
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,712
And that's because the heart of rock and roll is still beating replies but it does object that's true

639
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
If you'e Lewis is the one who's like week

640
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,600
You can't I got to stop the devil music

641
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,184
Then you're too far gone

642
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,512
Born into this guy's bio I found this nugget

643
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
David has the rare ability to communicate his message to young people as well as two parents using humor and interesting

644
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
So

645
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:32,128
Has me going into this interview that I weigh

646
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Connect with

647
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
You know who doesn't ever

648
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Connect with the kids

649
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
A Christian who says they can connect with the kids

650
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
With humor and

651
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
Who's scared of the devil rock music

652
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
You're scared of all music I want.

653
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
Going to put on some Bach

654
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,608
Oh my God

655
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:59,264
Alex real scared

656
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Some stories about Halloween

657
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
I don't know I need a citation

658
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Day of Samhain

659
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Kingdom

660
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
Diane Western Europe thousand years ago right

661
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
I ended a shopper Halloween early like five little skeletons in medication

662
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Serious issue

663
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
This is running rampant apparently kids are being kidnapped in the lead-up to Halloween

664
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
They're little

665
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
I found it it's covered up in the back back of the

666
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,552
It's so sad but the idea of little skeletons coming back to life on Halloween

667
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
You got to admit that

668
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Jumping up out of the ground just

669
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
I think that if this is

670
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,512
Is covered up in the back of the newspaper Alex should be able to find those articles

671
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Paper and put the pieces together to make a

672
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Specific case

673
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Can you cover something up

674
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
If you publish it in your knee

675
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
Newspaper in plain sight baby I understand why you would say

676
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
Hiddeninplainsight because you think it's in plain sight Android

677
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
However it is

678
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
It is not hit

679
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Whatsoever

680
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
I just need more information

681
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
His might just be a

682
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Fear thing

683
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
Yeah I do want to make sure everybody knows

684
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
There is no shame

685
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
I'm pronouncing it Samhain

686
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Sure

687
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
It's written like that I get it

688
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
That's fine I never heard it out loud until I was like 50

689
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
15 or whatever of course you don't know how it's pretty

690
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Your fault

691
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Sure not your fault

692
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
Another

693
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
And giving kids those like weird

694
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
Orange adore Brown wrapped

695
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
Half-eaten peanut butter

696
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
If you're going to get one of those kids that's

697
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
You might as well put a razor blade in there cops

698
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,904
Garbage I would rather almost because

699
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Probably wouldn't

700
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Eat the razor blade

701
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
And then I have a lawsuit

702
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Play one of those peanut butter candies nothing to be mad

703
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Can apples for what I was kind of

704
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Folklore

705
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,080
How funny is that somebody's like

706
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Kids are getting hurt

707
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,968
Because they're eating apples on Halloween

708
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,808
Think of a single person that I know who would have gotten an

709
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Even like a

710
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,928
Like a caramel apple or something

711
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,048
Like this is the wrong night for this get the f*** out of a Twix

712
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
Doesn't have a razor blade in it I don't care

713
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
So you might ask

714
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Halloween

715
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
Google what is the

716
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Well

717
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Ben Wise

718
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,176
Blackout lower joined by David Benoit Glory Ministry

719
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
It's a great to have you on the world I brought

720
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Thank you very much

721
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,392
Absolutely

722
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
So you know

723
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
Premise of Halloween is that Facebook witches believe that

724
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,864
The playoff between the natural and Supernatural that is tennis

725
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,192
During that time so they can communicate with the Dead

726
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
And

727
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
I find it quite interesting

728
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,896
Halloween you can tell when Halloween was coming because you hear it

729
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
See horror films in death movies and stuff

730
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Store hours a day 7 days a week around our country

731
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,880
And talking to the dead is not something that's new

732
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
Sumner

733
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
Went to the witch of Endor

734
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
So now we have

735
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Murder block

736
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Rice salad

737
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,472
Care about all these wicked things happening

738
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Okay

739
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
Unless they want our guns

740
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Wait wait wait

741
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
You're mad at the witches about Second Amendment issue

742
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
Just got hit with the I think I just got

743
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,488
I do think that it's pretty impressive to be able to

744
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Combined a conversation about how Wiki

745
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
Can talk to other worlds

746
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:14,240
Gun rights how are we how is everybody just talk

747
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Think about it like

748
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,872
Well which is believed that it's when the veil between things and everybody's talked

749
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Two Spirits before that's

750
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Just a regular old

751
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
Saul talk to the Wichita

752
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,808
I just had an interesting thought

753
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:33,440
If you are somebody who legitimately believe that witches are around and they can do magic

754
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
You should know that your guns not going to be effective again

755
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
That's them

756
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
Like you should recognize that gun rights are meaningless if you're up against the witches

757
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
Well I think

758
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Governor

759
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
I got a team of witches

760
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,152
Overthrow the government going to need to learn magic I really I really think that people

761
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Quite understand what the Imp

762
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Applications of magic being real

763
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,368
Trust me I do I thought about this

764
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
And it is it is very silly

765
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
It's very silly

766
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
No

767
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,792
Very silly I want to know which 14 things which is Due Amici

768
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
They don't want you to know that they are opposed to

769
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Five hundred bucks right

770
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,032
Right now that the number one thing

771
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
Witches are real

772
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Yeah probably

773
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
I would bet a million dollars

774
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,968
Sorry I don't know if this guy's book

775
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
Is actually called like the 14th

776
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,648
Or whatever 14 simple rules for dating

777
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,024
I don't know I don't think I would want to read a book by him anyway

778
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,608
No idea seems afraid of high school

779
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
Kids

780
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,264
San Mateo County Times

781
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
420

782
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
2002 highstone St

783
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Nejsem Club

784
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Transparent

785
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
An outrage

786
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
Found themselves to satanic

787
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
Society

788
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
Call presno the club James Doolittle

789
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
He originally started

790
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
The cab with the friend Matt

791
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
2 rifle things a bit alphabet

792
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
But now

793
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
That the two Juniors have cited

794
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,608
Pictures of Anton LaVey

795
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
They say that Satanism helps

796
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
People Express themselves

797
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
Is satanism

798
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Return Man

799
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
It's back

800
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,360
It is a natural state not have to be crushed by religion

801
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
Google public school

802
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Harry Potter in the Deep

803
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
There

804
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:45,536
I remember be

805
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
People shooting a brick about wickens

806
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:53,216
Combining Harry Potter with wickens

807
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Just being like

808
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
If they believe Magic

809
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
They definitely can't tell the difference

810
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
Between wiccans and Harry f****** Potter right

811
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
I got nothing against

812
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
People who were

813
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Interested in

814
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
Something like a wicker or whatever I do I do

815
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
I don't begrudge

816
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
I would argue though

817
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
These

818
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Kids

819
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Benoit's Hawk

820
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
About

821
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
They started it just to f*** with

822
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,168
It clearly said that just grateful things up a bit really said I was

823
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
And then

824
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
They found that

825
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
They like

826
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
Had some good laughs

827
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Is in there or whatever

828
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
I'm going to guess

829
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
Is it that is a Dismount from the club

830
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,968
You know what I mean like yeah I'm going to guess these guys are not saying this

831
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
After graduation

832
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,064
Even go so far as

833
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
To say

834
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
But if someone in the first

835
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
Quotes as we started the

836
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Club 24

837
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Good thing Zedd

838
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Quote says

839
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
We believe all of it now

840
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
You might

841
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Still be getting

842
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
You f***** with you moron possible

843
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,752
Presentation is that they're saying they believe in our vehicle so wonderful

844
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,664
No they did not say actually the devil's real and Wheeler

845
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,784
Not worried about high schoolers having weird

846
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Fun

847
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
Club slippery slope

848
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,696
Let him you let high schoolers have one slippery slope funclub with the Devil

849
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,768
Next thing you know the reading critical race Theory and it's all over

850
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Over for the wrestler

851
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Went to HighSchool with

852
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
I might

853
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
You know like

854
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Not much

855
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
Yeah it would be something that would be interesting to

856
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Outside of that

857
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
I don't know it all

858
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
High School

859
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Columbia

860
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
And like Rockbridge was the other High

861
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
If there was a Satanism Club over at Rockbridge

862
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
I wouldn't care

863
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Yeah

864
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,904
Not my business many generations

865
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
David Ulta

866
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Freaking out about what

867
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,072
Isolated children are doing thousands of miles away from them

868
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
Is going to eventually be like

869
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Oh maybe

870
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
This is dumb

871
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
This is a show in Texas where adults

872
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Or talking about high schoolers

873
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,104
In San Mateo California

874
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Perhaps

875
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
In this situation

876
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Those children are more adults

877
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Maybe

878
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
Pictures are protected by the government

879
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
I don't have to do that

880
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,488
I'm sorry what now

881
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,120
Cannot hire or fire person because you cannot fire a person because of their religious status

882
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,728
Did they say they're there

883
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Discrimination religion

884
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
Discrimination

885
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
Oh absolutely

886
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Okay

887
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Alright oh man

888
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,296
To be a fly on the wall of people whose

889
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
The largest problem is

890
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
Witches are getting jobs

891
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
You're not even allowed to fire someone just cuz they say they were which

892
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
Yeah I mean like you know the same rules

893
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
The protect

894
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
People who have

895
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Religious beliefs

896
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
Or going to religious

897
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
Applications like being a witch

898
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
It's right are the exact same rules that protect

899
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
People who work

900
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,664
It is no it is wild who how when a religion gets

901
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
To put its boot on the neck of other religion I like

902
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,832
Religious protections are terrible but when they've got the boot on their neck they go eat

903
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,928
Hebrew just protection

904
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,024
Which is definitely not cuz of us

905
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
So we get back to Harry Potter

906
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Shockingly

907
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,728
I don't know if this is true cuz I don't remember Harry Potter

908
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Yeah

909
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,568
I'm sorry if this is true but it just sounds really dumb

910
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
Here's the thing with Harry Potter

911
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
As I got a whole

912
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:51,552
Water stuff on Harry Potter's not fact I've got a brand new book out entitled

913
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
And I do talk about Harry Potter

914
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
You know

915
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Five of his

916
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:05,632
And I know in my presentation how easily this for a child to go from

917
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,264
The real witchcraft

918
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
The way way way way

919
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Okay no.

920
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Dude I like Dumbledore does die and like snake dies right

921
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:25,600
But he kills Dumbledore Dumbledore told him to

922
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,416
Secret lyrics

923
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,256
John Cleese ghost I remember from the first one

924
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Is it

925
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
Four out of the five professors

926
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:45,568
Well okay so this is just that every dark arts

927
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Professor

928
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Can only be there for a year

929
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,688
Parker Stevenson

930
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Yeah but

931
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
I mean

932
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,344
Wait for the fuk what wait wait till four out of the five dark arts

933
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Professors are dead

934
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
Oh yeah they just

935
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Right

936
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Yeah I don't

937
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,816
Five dark arts professors at the same time

938
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,424
So actually one is still alive but will later be bad

939
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
Furthermore furthermore if we're going to start treating this

940
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
As a

941
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
That for

942
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
We must also admit that

943
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Ghosts are available

944
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,088
To just about anybody at any time goes through and play

945
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
I do think that it is strange that he's

946
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Concerned about these

947
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,024
These characters being died in like Harry being able to talk to the dead because

948
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
You can easily go from Harry Potter's website to real witchcraft

949
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
Techno time then you could talk

950
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,384
I'm frustrated I'm frustrated by this

951
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Talk to the Dead

952
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
That's a no-brainer

953
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Right he's not offering me talking to the dead I got to wait for that s*** f*** that give me a couple weeks of a core

954
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,743
I want the you-know-what can I want to talk to the gym

955
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
It's a crapshoot

956
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
Like really boring

957
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah that's true

958
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,471
Just make it more interesting than you were a life

959
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,055
Philosophers are like Taylor Swift

960
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
We worked 18 hours a day and then I died

961
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
I couldn't breathe

962
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:36,159
What was the Industrial Revolution like choking today was a child labor

963
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,023
I died at 10

964
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,119
Thank you for creating our modern world

965
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,679
I'm the kid who discovered maybe we should bring a

966
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,263
Canary with us into the coal mine

967
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,823
To talk to you I just I'm just saying that some people are dumb

968
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
Didn't read too much

969
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
To look

970
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
What do you do if you don't

971
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
Particularly Harry Potter

972
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
You're going to tire wear

973
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,391
Treating Harry Potter's relocate very much.

974
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
Somebody who's like Harry Potter's real and

975
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
At school

976
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
If you don't read Harry Potter

977
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
So many parents

978
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Call me

979
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
That in the classroom they cannot eat

980
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
If a child is not Richard Potter books

981
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
How they confront

982
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,687
Right at the main entrance or mosasaurus options Giants

983
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
Harry Potter

984
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Teaching Aid

985
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
Piled up there

986
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Really popular book

987
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,327
I mean yeah also we can solve that Barnes & Noble problem

988
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
To their God

989
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
Yeah you got you got what you wanted

990
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
No words

991
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Displays at Barnes & Noble

992
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:59,359
I don't know if I believe that if you don't read Harry Potter you flung

993
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
Cuz I don't think any

994
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,527
School I don't invited the stuff to believe that it's cool would have Harry Potter be a mandatory

995
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
Peace of curriculum

996
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,207
Do you mean considering the fact that apparently has two parents at any given School believes that Harry Potter's real

997
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,279
Also it's casual reading

998
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
It's it's good for like

999
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:23,167
You know kid learning to read a lot so many different

1000
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
Examples of

1001
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Peaches

1002
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Math

1003
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
In a way that would like it.

1004
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
I find it difficult to believe that

1005
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
It's some teacher if some kid was like

1006
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
Look I'm not comfortable with reading this

1007
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
Oh okay what are you

1008
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
I can't see that happen

1009
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,855
You know what's ironic about that is that

1010
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
For so long you do think this is

1011
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,207
This is just like casual reading

1012
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,815
You were to put that through a critical appreciation you be like

1013
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
Oh

1014
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
She was a Turf all alone

1015
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Of course

1016
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
I should have just paid attention

1017
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
Four out of the five Turks on the Buckeye

1018
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Yeah probably

1019
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
So

1020
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
I don't know I don't

1021
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
I didn't cut out that much

1022
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
Trump interview

1023
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,343
But this doesn't make sense even if you listen to the whole thing

1024
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
You know I

1025
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
Missionary

1026
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,327
Play this woman to the Lord and after leading her to the Lord then what he did was he

1027
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,191
She said would you please talk to my husband because he needs to be safe so every morning he sit there and drink

1028
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Check with Amanda

1029
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Share the gospel with him

1030
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
They got deathly ill

1031
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,615
And I went and did blood work in the man fed

1032
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
The doctor said

1033
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
Lisa Richards are you working with rat poison

1034
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Michigan someone's rat poison you

1035
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
And what it was

1036
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Coffee with everyday

1037
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Would you put a little

1038
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,743
Not enough to change the taste

1039
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Calls Amanda guy right there

1040
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,655
And I thought that's exactly what Isis ideas right now

1041
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,567
Little dos after little dose first was Bewitched

1042
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
Buffy the Vampire Slayer and everything else Charmed and

1043
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,015
And they all available for our children and

1044
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,623
They were actively recruit

1045
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
At night and it's

1046
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Turning in

1047
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,263
Titanic

1048
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
Soviet-style

1049
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
What what

1050
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Like I get the metaphor the

1051
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,735
Obviously

1052
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,575
That's we can shorten it but that's fine story is obviously like something

1053
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Pamphlet or something

1054
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
You scared of non-believers my God

1055
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,423
Anything the Bewitched is a little bit of poison

1056
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a little bit of poison

1057
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
Yes I get that

1058
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
I just don't get

1059
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,079
Military on the streets

1060
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
What an event

1061
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Shorter jump

1062
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
I guess these people getting sucked off in a hot tub

1063
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Yes

1064
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:22,623
Being a little bit over

1065
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Sexualize

1066
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
I don't know I don't know

1067
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
I guess that is also satanic

1068
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Text to Alex

1069
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
I just ran

1070
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
I'm going to have to

1071
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Go with

1072
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
If you are

1073
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
If you're telling me you know like

1074
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,495
Did Sabrina the Teenage Witch it's all there just

1075
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
You don't get to participate

1076
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
Culture anymore

1077
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
It's not for you

1078
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Maybe sometimes you just don't get it

1079
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,015
Can you also be scared of like Touched by an Angel

1080
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Like you should be scared of

1081
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
Christian shows that are about supernatural

1082
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Here's the problem

1083
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:59,231
The Christian shows that are about supernatural s*** almost always wind up

1084
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,279
Hand waving things away with

1085
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
Very similar explanation

1086
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
To it was mad

1087
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Sure

1088
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
So there's a conspiracy

1089
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
And that is at the school

1090
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Want to give kids

1091
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Computers

1092
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Some people might

1093
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
I think that this is because

1094
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Technology

1095
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
Is advancing

1096
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
And computer literacy is

1097
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
That's pretty important

1098
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
For kids being able

1099
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Navigate

1100
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
A lot of the aspects

1101
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Does the new modern world end

1102
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Interconnectedness

1103
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,695
So the show is set in 1984 that were afraid of rock and roll Ephrata

1104
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Good Witch

1105
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
And we're afraid of

1106
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Computers

1107
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
A c b y schools together

1108
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Computers

1109
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
So you know

1110
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:42,751
Objectives of the school system must make sure that every child has a computer

1111
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
And that every child has access to the internet

1112
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
Cialix

1113
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Is that

1114
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
If you type into your search engine the work witchcraft

1115
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
340 1005

1116
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
10400

1117
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
John Edwards

1118
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,999
They supposed to talk to the Dead

1119
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,583
If you don't believe that people can engage in necromancy

1120
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
It's not really that threatening for a kid to be exposed to it

1121
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Lake Princeton

1122
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,519
The kid I was exposed to the idea of telekinesis through the X-Men

1123
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,335
Holy s*** I wanted to do it right

1124
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
I tried and I

1125
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
I couldn't and I realize it.

1126
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
Fictional ability and I was able to in

1127
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
Enjoy the X-Men in a different way

1128
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
Completely wrong the thing is

1129
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
Is the X-Men didn't give you

1130
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,415
A roadmap to learning how to do that unlike Harry Potter which teaches you how to do math

1131
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
I would argue that Alex

1132
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,279
And David have not yet made it to the staff that I

1133
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:43,423
Cross when I try to do telekinesis limited watch

1134
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,239
Progression of understanding

1135
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,311
When did X-Men first came out 2003

1136
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,151
Last week

1137
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,991
I think this is really stupid

1138
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Who's bad I think that if you

1139
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
You have to believe

1140
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
That kid

1141
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
Can be turned into Magic

1142
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Witches

1143
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
In order to be worried about the

1144
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Lincoln

1145
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Anyway

1146
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Alex

1147
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
The guy who needs a respite

1148
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
You know like

1149
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:20,031
Oldest military on the streets there's soviet-style propaganda and Chloe's in a hot tub

1150
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
Which is walking

1151
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Everywhere everywhere

1152
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Government has them

1153
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
This is a guy who needs a break

1154
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,967
You need to place that he can be safe

1155
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
And then they also have another program on WGN Beyond

1156
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
And these people

1157
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,159
Communicate with the Dead

1158
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
Tell my wife

1159
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Yeah

1160
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
Absolutely

1161
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
So

1162
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,543
Everything but the

1163
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,407
To the end of the age of this kind of related to a football game or basketball game

1164
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:02,271
You can always

1165
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
In the final inning

1166
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
You can see them

1167
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,415
Since the last 2 minutes of a basketball football game is intense

1168
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
5

1169
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
I know that they only have a short time to get it done

1170
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,095
Some 19 years ago we were in the final Innings of the game and they were really

1171
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Trying to

1172
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
Cool do realize we've been in the

1173
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
Fourth-quarter overtime

1174
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,359
For several thousand years ago

1175
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,407
It's been a long overtime

1176
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
I would argue we should end it

1177
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Jesus

1178
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
God and Satan tired everything

1179
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
Find we just move on it's like soccer rules

1180
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
Will be an interesting proposal to try into workout

1181
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
Between God and the devil

1182
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
The devil would take that

1183
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,239
He's going to be a holdout

1184
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,335
So eight you remember

1185
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
The man Michael Dukakis

1186
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,967
Yes I do remember a man in the tank looking very strong

1187
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,271
Do you think that he ever did anyting over

1188
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Berkeley satanic

1189
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,927
I don't know it's getting into tank is overtly satanic I think

1190
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
He likes Texas big gun

1191
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
Nobita do one thing

1192
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
Maybe we forgot about

1193
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,911
I got a woman at salt that I talk about in my presentation

1194
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
And she's a witch

1195
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
And from

1196
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Laurie Cabot

1197
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:34,175
It was a known as the official Witch of Salem she was nominated by Michael Dukakis

1198
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,247
When he was running for the president knighted states of America

1199
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,903
It would be good for America

1200
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
What

1201
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Well it's amazing

1202
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
This is not just a Democrat

1203
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,935
You know also it was very well known that mrs. Reagan went to

1204
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
Astrologers and things like that as well

1205
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
Really nailed it that time

1206
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,687
So what the event was talking about is that actually true

1207
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
Laurie Cabot was named the official witch

1208
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
To Salem by Michael Dukakis back in 1977 when he was the governor of Massachusetts

1209
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,207
Pictures of towns all over the world

1210
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,535
Decision was basically recognizing toothache

1211
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
One there's a

1212
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
The tradition of which

1213
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Shitted

1214
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
Massachusetts Indie Northeast in general

1215
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,423
Into

1216
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,983
Cabot open what she claims is he

1217
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
First witch shop in America

1218
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,359
Back in the 70s

1219
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,759
Excel's dump pills do you want to be mad at some lady selling incense and bath salts I guess that's a fun game for him to play but

1220
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
Shouldn't you be a witch

1221
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,647
Or a warlock for the magic that these pills do on your body

1222
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Armenia

1223
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
It's like being in like what like 1920

1224
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,047
San Francisco be like there's this man going around

1225
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,607
Calling himself the king of America

1226
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,959
What is a democracy

1227
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
It's all a monarchy

1228
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
Yeah

1229
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:09,919
There was a person experiencing homelessness

1230
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
Columbia

1231
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
Andy Warhol Burger King

1232
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:17,855
King crown around he called himself the king of Columbia and a lot of people would salute him and

1233
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,391
I'm just treat him yet

1234
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
Yeah

1235
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
Diderot democracy

1236
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,655
I died of a well I mean here we are the reason that I move to Chicago

1237
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Takeover of it Maher show

1238
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,079
I can say for sure that it is entirely his fault citizens united went through the Supreme Court the way it did I had to

1239
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
If we ever knew you had a coup

1240
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
He overthrew Darwin Hindman

1241
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
Alex

1242
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,111
Shakira

1243
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
I'm running with

1244
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Now

1245
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,743
Based on what we know from his later talk we should know that

1246
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
He

1247
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,655
I had a lot of running how many he was there which he tried to recruit him slept with a lot of them

1248
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Yelp

1249
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,775
Honeypot everybody a bunch of cheerleaders

1250
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
Cheerleaders little bit differently back in 2002

1251
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,415
Floating

1252
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,999
Softer

1253
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,935
Women's arguments seem a little bit better if he was talking about like

1254
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,471
I hung out with

1255
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
F***** cheerleader

1256
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,591
It'd be a really forceful testimony

1257
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
Certainly up

1258
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
To the

1259
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,783
Actual experience

1260
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:56,159
I've had run-ins with powerful witches kind of increase his Mystique almost

1261
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,719
Giving him a kind of full caloric

1262
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
Figure

1263
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,071
Did you know early on in your career

1264
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
Well I guess

1265
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
It kind of works

1266
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:09,215
If you just do it later just mostly forgotten about your brother too

1267
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
So it looked at this pain while guy is

1268
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,103
Best news whenever he's talking about like being able to connect with

1269
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
The kids I think

1270
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
No

1271
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
He's just getting really boring

1272
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
About to Halloween

1273
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
In here

1274
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,295
Number one more history on

1275
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,623
On Halloween

1276
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,463
Somebody protect

1277
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,767
Information is always crucial

1278
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
You know I think that's

1279
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Zoobilee Zoo

1280
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,607
Understand

1281
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
What does

1282
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,167
What the whole thing is all about

1283
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
As matter fact

1284
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
You know I wrote a track

1285
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,591
Last year entitled Halloween a trick

1286
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
Are a treat and I give them

1287
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
The difference

1288
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
Traditions like for example

1289
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Come from

1290
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,087
Talk about the jack o'lantern you know that

1291
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Came from Great Britain

1292
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
And Jack was

1293
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,719
Reneged on it

1294
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,023
Ended up having to get a cold

1295
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,863
They trick the devil and they put it into a turnip and then he had to walk

1296
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
The pace the Earthen

1297
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
And stuff like that

1298
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
It would wear masks

1299
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
Because they would be afraid

1300
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
That

1301
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,871
After going to the baelfyr the bonfire that they'd be afraid till they figure they

1302
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,199
It scares a ghost or scare the spirits Away by wearing masks

1303
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,111
Animals

1304
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,023
Oh absolutely Associated Press reported that

1305
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,863
AP report

1306
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Two

1307
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,215
April 2002 26

1308
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
Devilman

1309
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,591
Turn back on and then he put his head into a turnip

1310
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
What you going to do

1311
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
What you going to do

1312
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
Addresses of adjoining like teens

1313
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Listening to that being

1314
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
So bored man this guy

1315
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
He knows how to engage us

1316
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,623
Interesting fact

1317
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
Rock and roll being

1318
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Of the devil

1319
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Obvious

1320
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Yeah totally off

1321
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
Yeah

1322
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
But there's some

1323
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
Not so obvious things

1324
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,631
Why would like to warn you

1325
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
Some movies

1326
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,727
Maybe there more fiction

1327
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Again

1328
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,615
When you get to talking about the dead and talking to the dead in the show you

1329
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,919
Here's the thing that really gives me Alex

1330
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
Is that there's the obvious

1331
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
And when I

1332
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,647
I've done things on rock music.

1333
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,463
And talk about the obvious

1334
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,743
But

1335
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Settle

1336
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,303
For example like

1337
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
Talking to the Dead

1338
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
There movies like

1339
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
And where boy is

1340
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
Supposed to see spirits

1341
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,287
Stop nobody can see him and then you've got ghostware

1342
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,127
They've had some

1343
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Hey buddy nothing either those are subtle

1344
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,271
Wasn't the tagline of the 6m

1345
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
I see dead people

1346
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,415
Freddy's of the movie

1347
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,439
It's called Coast

1348
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
These are subtle thing

1349
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
If you

1350
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,215
To present to me as being a

1351
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
Religious scholar

1352
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
I think you would like that

1353
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Glory minutes

1354
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,871
And you also believe

1355
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
That movies are real

1356
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,015
I think it cheapens Your Glory

1357
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
If you know what I mean

1358
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
But I don't think you're ready for this though

1359
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Okay

1360
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
I've got ghostware

1361
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
Jaitley had

1362
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,655
Also in the movie

1363
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
Lion King

1364
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,519
Show me talk to his father who is that

1365
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:59,103
And there's a lot of questions you say why was anything wrong with it well

1366
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,175
You know I had one guy two

1367
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Christian

1368
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:07,039
College one day film it's been awhile and see it that way the way I saw it was

1369
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,111
That symbol is like Jesus

1370
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
And he was talking to his Heavenly Father

1371
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
How you know he is

1372
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
Exactly

1373
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Yeah we got

1374
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,519
Lion King ep the rabbit

1375
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
I am afraid of the world

1376
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
I don't

1377
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Anyting

1378
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,455
To look like we have to keep going on This Thread about the lion

1379
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,551
Because he's he's pretty concerned with the Lion King

1380
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
Some people have given him some rebuttals

1381
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,439
That might actually like it was what about this bro

1382
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:50,559
Well I have I have a problem already with his first rebuttal which is I Saw The Lion King and somehow is a metaphor

1383
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
Jesus

1384
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
Struggling there

1385
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,447
White down again for this because

1386
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,287
Sorry whatever lion comes up Mike must go down

1387
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,335
In-N-Out is

1388
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:06,687
Stiletto hammer

1389
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
Holy Spirit

1390
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,391
Do you only miss one minor problem with that analogy and that's it

1391
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,719
Father

1392
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,743
God and

1393
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,791
Send it to be a god

1394
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
The New Age movement

1395
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:27,167
Jesus father has always been God is always been in heaven

1396
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,447
And therefore

1397
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,239
He's never had to Diana's

1398
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,311
Send to be an ascended master

1399
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
Nefarious messages

1400
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,343
Of Mufasa

1401
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
Okay give me one second

1402
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
So if I

1403
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,303
Star Wars a really need to understand this correct

1404
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Okay

1405
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
Because of

1406
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Ghost

1407
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
The Lion King

1408
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
Subtle

1409
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
Because of

1410
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
E.t.

1411
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
Because

1412
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Bewitched

1413
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,895
Haha because of Sabrina the Teenage Witch

1414
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,455
Buffy the Vampire Slayer

1415
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,527
We need to take our kids out of school

1416
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,111
School is where those Pacific

1417
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
Things are found

1418
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:24,511
I did think that that was a strange leap not to be the conclusion of this

1419
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,791
Stupid conversation

1420
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,911
How about Rafiki I don't understand

1421
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
That was just too obvious

1422
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,543
Timon and Pumbaa who are they

1423
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
That's if I mean is based out of

1424
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,759
Nala is Joan of Arc

1425
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:51,391
Oh my God yeah they're scared

1426
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
These guys

1427
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,999
Would absolutely go ape shitt if they ever heard of Esco

1428
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,327
They would be over for them if you like

1429
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Crowded supposed to be joking

1430
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,703
There's a chorus I don't get it where they from

1431
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
Does magic this is devil real

1432
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,567
So yeah man if you have Harry Potter in

1433
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
School

1434
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
You should be able to

1435
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
Covid-19

1436
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
Interesting also is

1437
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
I was

1438
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
Call my lady from Knox

1439
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,623
Tennessee

1440
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
Under the Hogwarts

1441
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Score for Witchcraft and Wizardry

1442
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
And get into a room

1443
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,047
And so when I told the principal I didn't want my daughter there

1444
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,863
He said okay then water little note

1445
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
And we'll take her out of the class

1446
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
But you know what my suggest

1447
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
She wants to that is

1448
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
If that offends

1449
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
Harry Potter

1450
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
And go out of class

1451
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,687
Felt lonely say that

1452
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Offended about praying in school

1453
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
Yeah why don't we sue them

1454
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
I don't know I think there's a slight difference between like room decorations

1455
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
Around a popular book

1456
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
And

1457
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
Sort of

1458
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
Communal

1459
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,983
Enforced by the school organized by the school

1460
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Religious

1461
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
I'm interesting about

1462
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,359
Is that that is exactly the

1463
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
The point of

1464
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,151
All of the rest

1465
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:23,807
In the same way this is a big part

1466
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:28,159
Right now the right-wing is making up a way of fictional

1467
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:31,999
If you put the victim of in order to consolidate their

1468
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
Insane

1469
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
Power already

1470
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,399
CRT in order to get rid of any kind of

1471
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
Troubling history

1472
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,543
Let people see Harry Potter in schools or

1473
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
I say

1474
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Just to be

1475
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Fair

1476
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
We should allow

1477
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,247
Prayer to be in schools all the time I'm just saying

1478
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,295
Baroness Dandy baroness

1479
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:00,927
I'm going to maliciously misinterpret Harry Potter as an actual religion

1480
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
Absolutely

1481
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,767
In order to justify me bringing religion into

1482
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,535
The schools

1483
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
That will eventually be in

1484
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
Enforce

1485
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
The obvious thing that he doesn't

1486
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
The point that he's really

1487
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,775
Is that Harry Potter and Christianity are both equally

1488
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
Now what you think of the children

1489
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:23,199
Play I'm refusing to think of the children ever again

1490
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
You're at your monster

1491
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
Now

1492
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
Think of the kids

1493
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
Who don't like Harry Potter

1494
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
They're off

1495
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,671
Exercise like Harry Potter

1496
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,463
And I was fine just happened to you

1497
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Yeah why don't we sue them

1498
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
More importantly

1499
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Precise the children

1500
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,959
You're a weirdo for leaving

1501
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,983
Exactly

1502
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,103
He called her a muggle a muggle is annoying

1503
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Harry Potter's books

1504
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
Supposed to be a non

1505
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
Which

1506
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Are sorcerer

1507
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
It's a natural person someone who doesn't believe in

1508
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
When the girl left

1509
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
Could you imagine what

1510
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
Uprising with BMF

1511
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
If someone

1512
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
Like a

1513
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,863
Hindu or say a Muslim

1514
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
I didn't want to pledge allegiance

1515
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:19,007
The flag of didn't want to say in God we trust her or had to pray

1516
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
Amanda leaving about 2

1517
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Mother mother

1518
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
Muslim Muslim

1519
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,407
All kind of lawsuits

1520
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,455
You know what it is

1521
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
Alexandra

1522
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Does Christian

1523
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
Don't say

1524
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
Don't say the only

1525
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
100%

1526
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
False

1527
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,999
Real thing that you

1528
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,535
You said Diamond what if

1529
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
Kids were rude

1530
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
To minorities and

1531
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,679
But here's the other thing

1532
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:52,031
So ridiculous again one of those things about Harry Potter that

1533
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359
A close reading would analyze so f****** differently

1534
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,407
The thing about Harry Potter

1535
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,527
Is that the slur that Wizards use again

1536
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,343
Wizards use the slur mudblood against

1537
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
Wizards with non-magical pair

1538
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Right

1539
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,303
All fine and it's a horrible thing to use the mudblood

1540
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
All of them use muggle

1541
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
All the time

1542
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,519
Yeah it's like no problem whatsoever just this slur about a class of people

1543
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:28,127
Just all the time it's those types of thing where it's like all this slur is bad

1544
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,151
For the people I like

1545
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:33,759
Find a gift layers around for all the people that aren't involved with our funds

1546
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
Story

1547
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,831
It's silly to be like

1548
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:43,487
The trauma of people calling her a muggle

1549
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,303
To somebody of a minority group and write

1550
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
It does

1551
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,911
There is not an uproar

1552
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Give a s*** about that

1553
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,799
You would be like well you got to take it on the chin if your Traditions are different than ours are

1554
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,079
Or whatever the f***

1555
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
The only thing that's important

1556
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,663
Is that we are always the victims

1557
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
And you should do whatever we say yeah

1558
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Because we're the Vic

1559
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,343
Yep ye

1560
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
The pray in school

1561
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,415
If your dad Harry Potter

1562
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,207
But there's another thing that you should

1563
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
To be at 4

1564
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,303
I'm not

1565
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
You know

1566
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Stay out there

1567
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,591
They're taught how to handle us

1568
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
You know

1569
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
If you think that's the case then why don't you let the

1570
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,575
Teachers peach seed

1571
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
Start please frequently

1572
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
Russian novels that are out there

1573
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:57,727
That argument is pretty cute and I think it's kind of funny that David thinks Harry Potter is in any way similar to Left Behind

1574
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
Hematic lior

1575
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,823
Like the intent of the writing or evenly

1576
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
Equality of the book

1577
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
It's silly

1578
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
But there's a much bigger problem

1579
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
To deal with here

1580
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,991
The books of Left Behind are very

1581
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,015
Very specific

1582
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
Sickly a story about a

1583
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
Pre-tribulation rapture

1584
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,463
The Rapture happens and then those who are left behind in the rapture

1585
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,791
It's essentially the whole point of that 16 book series

1586
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,351
I don't care about this at all but Alex think

1587
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
Pre-tribulation Rapture preaching

1588
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Is heresy

1589
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
He's a strong post

1590
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,287
Trib guy and it's pretty funny to hear someone bring up left behind on his show

1591
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,079
And see him not get mad about

1592
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,407
Worries about the suggestion that left behind be taught in schools

1593
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,991
Probably more so than Harry Potter left behind

1594
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Before

1595
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,855
Yeah you should be furious about the idea of life behind being invoked on his show

1596
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
Hate to be exact wrong image

1597
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
All of this

1598
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
The tribulation in the rapture

1599
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,047
Actually is insidiously

1600
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Teaching

1601
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,351
Patriots and the Christian

1602
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
Do not be ready to fight

1603
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,031
Furious and he's not concerned about

1604
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
Somebody saying

1605
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
Pre-trip might be real

1606
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:11,711
This is the novel series being recommended for children in public school seems very odd

1607
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Yeah

1608
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,551
There's also a very strong

1609
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,575
Difference between

1610
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,879
The notion of a school

1611
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
Teaching Harry Potter

1612
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Allowing

1613
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,511
Behind

1614
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
Recreational reading

1615
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,375
I read like five of the novels and then I was

1616
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
But they kept going

1617
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Yeah

1618
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Yeah

1619
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,287
I think that if I recall correctly when they made a movie

1620
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
Of that

1621
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
My dad got like a pro

1622
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Press copy

1623
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Or something they wanted

1624
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,687
Cameron

1625
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:48,319
Original one

1626
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Very not

1627
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,463
EverBank memory of emails how dumb Christianity

1628
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
Look

1629
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
There's

1630
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,375
They don't do anything

1631
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,655
And that's why

1632
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
Kids are called

1633
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,495
In school or whatever

1634
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
And and also

1635
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
I will say that this is an interesting fact

1636
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
The David Byrne

1637
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
This is next

1638
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
It's an interesting fact that would help him connect

1639
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
With the children

1640
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
Eminem

1641
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Immediately lose

1642
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
You know I read the other day

1643
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Spiders

1644
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,767
They have their venom is more powerful than the Black Widow are we doing this

1645
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,071
The reason why most people don't know that

1646
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,119
Is because the daddy long leg

1647
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,679
Spyder cannot open its mouth

1648
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,727
Enter the human

1649
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,543
You do not heard that red.

1650
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,079
You know that that Alex

1651
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
I forgot just like Christianity

1652
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
What

1653
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Hold on

1654
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,039
You know

1655
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
The jump

1656
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,743
The jumping spider we are watching

1657
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
Level triple leaps of logic

1658
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:07,935
Should I cannot understand whatsoever kind of indicates do you what their act

1659
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,287
Actually talking about what they're actually mad about he's not mad about Harry Potter

1660
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:16,639
He's mad about like feeling that people are too gay and Alex thinks there's too much

1661
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,663
Mosquito Indian dating

1662
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
They don't feel like

1663
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
Their ideas are in Kent

1664
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,271
Control of public

1665
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Education

1666
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,599
You know that's really what they're mad about that I care about him

1667
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Book about a boy wizard

1668
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
It seems like Everywhere I Go

1669
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,743
The world that I had B

1670
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,791
Beaten into me when I was a child

1671
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,095
Is not the same

1672
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
These people are

1673
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Yeah

1674
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,935
Just f****** stop

1675
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,263
And one of the things I find also

1676
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:48,895
And to take the Monstrous nusenda clear over homophobia out of this

1677
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
I'm trying to have a

1678
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,943
Clunky metaphor

1679
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
Many clunky metaphysics

1680
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Think about this

1681
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,343
The daddy longlegs venomous

1682
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
True

1683
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
But it can't bite you because

1684
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
Cuz I can open its mouth

1685
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
Stop big enough to bite you

1686
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Stroke of Luck on our

1687
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:07,071
Now he's saying that the Christians are like that there more venomous

1688
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Then other crew

1689
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,167
Great let's leave that aside but you aren't venomous nest

1690
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
You think they're unwilling

1691
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,031
To flex that muscle

1692
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
So are use that vent

1693
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,639
Christianity I know not like the daddy long leg

1694
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,431
Can't bring itself to buy

1695
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
Physically

1696
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,295
So is this is analogous at all then the Christians

1697
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,575
Can't physically used

1698
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,623
Is this power they are unable to exert this

1699
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,695
Quote on quote extra venomous snakes that they have

1700
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
It's not a choice

1701
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
Through the daddy long leg

1702
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,279
Nature

1703
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
Their jaw

1704
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Right

1705
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Right

1706
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
I would say the metaphor might make more sense if you said that Christians were filled with Venom

1707
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
And

1708
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
You know they didn't bite

1709
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
People that they just

1710
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
F****** bothering me

1711
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
You don't do you know what

1712
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,271
You know it's teaching the kids devilry

1713
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,087
Venom 2 carnage

1714
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,463
Carnage

1715
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
Is really really upsetting

1716
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,279
After the

1717
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:16,191
Stupidity and nonsense of Harry Potter and Rafiki being the Holy Spirit

1718
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
Really f****** upset

1719
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,943
Atheist

1720
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
He just won't say anything

1721
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,783
Tell me what they all you could never get prayer back

1722
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
America

1723
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,559
Is loaded with Christianity they just don't need about on everything

1724
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,399
Christian stations

1725
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
Be quiet go along

1726
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Oh yeah

1727
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,567
So I can't tell if what he's saying is everybody love to pray after 9/11

1728
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,383
Or if you think you said we can't get Pro back in

1729
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,199
School let's blow up some buildings and see if you pray

1730
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,991
Either way

1731
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
They could go either way

1732
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
But it's at least

1733
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,087
Inarticulate

1734
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,647
It's in articulately deliver to the point where

1735
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,695
I think those are both readings up

1736
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,791
Write what you could have said was there no atheists in a foxhole

1737
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
Sure he know that is if that's his in

1738
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
Intense right

1739
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,887
Then that's what you should have

1740
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
No one is

1741
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,447
Is going to then create Fox

1742
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:25,055
Foxholes in order to create Christy I wasn't like what we should do with the

1743
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
Creative Foxhole Chris

1744
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
What would you do is wish

1745
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,895
To kill a lot of people

1746
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,967
How to make them get into foxholes and then they will be atheists anymore

1747
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,503
See that's what God wants

1748
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,575
Has to do dance and that really was like wow

1749
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
I think that this is

1750
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
What is a convertible

1751
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,511
You keep trying to say like people were very religious after

1752
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,327
If that's what he was trying to say he said it

1753
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,351
About the worst

1754
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
And most

1755
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
Irresponsible

1756
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
Short you know I mean

1757
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
Verb for me

1758
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,847
If I was going to listen to his

1759
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
We could do all of these things

1760
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
But we stay quiet

1761
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
I would ask

1762
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,503
How many APA

1763
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Or

1764
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,599
How many I mean

1765
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Let's say

1766
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:17,023
How many elected representatives throughout American history openly profess to not having any

1767
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,631
Play Just beliefs whatsoever you don't want to play this game because they'll just argue that the most

1768
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,423
Presidents are secrets

1769
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,311
Secret atheist there was never any point

1770
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,359
You know George Washington

1771
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,895
Was the only president who didn't

1772
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,455
Read Harry might as well

1773
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
So can you imagine

1774
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
Going back on

1775
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
50 years

1776
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
Telling a church

1777
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,623
Search about Harry Potter cuz David Benoit

1778
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Again

1779
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Process

1780
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,767
Changing People

1781
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Exactly

1782
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:56,703
See if I Carlos I was thinking the church the other day that's 156 years old they were celebrating 156

1783
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Anniversary

1784
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,007
Could you imagine

1785
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,079
If I came to the church

1786
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,151
And said that there would be a boy named Harry Potter

1787
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,223
And that he was going to be attending the Hogwarts School for witchcraft

1788
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
Willow tree

1789
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,807
Emmett children would be reading the book and end

1790
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,135
You smashing what they having at

1791
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
I said

1792
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,719
The people in that church

1793
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,839
Not anymore

1794
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,935
I don't know how many churches

1795
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,031
Necessarily were using Harry Potter Ivan I don't know what they would use it

1796
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
4

1797
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,823
I don't know what youth group

1798
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,615
Need to have assigned reading

1799
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,663
Miserly other than the Bible

1800
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,479
Well I mean you know the power goes out

1801
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,527
Keller and the blight

1802
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
Spell I guess there are some

1803
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Youth group

1804
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,111
Churches

1805
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,927
Bam Harry Potter and maybe that's what he's responding

1806
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,999
So proud of you go back to 150

1807
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
26 years before but like

1808
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,559
I mean I rather be

1809
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
I will tell you that like

1810
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Gulliver's

1811
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
Travel

1812
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,471
If you got tiny people

1813
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,495
1846

1814
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:06,335
I told them that children would be into witches they would be like

1815
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,407
You're fuking right they are and we got to stop them

1816
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:14,527
Let's go let's get our torches and pitchforks because in 1856

1817
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,111
We totally believe riches witches are real

1818
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,135
Google that can make a bath

1819
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,671
There were witches and other things

1820
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
Different rate for Harry Potter

1821
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,023
Also Frankenstein the book

1822
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,607
Churches probably mad about that came out in 1818

1823
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,679
Do you know what they were

1824
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
I'll tell you this

1825
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Do you know what the

1826
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,031
The book churches were most mad about with us

1827
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
It came out

1828
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:43,199
The f****** Bible oh yeah they had a lot of us about that various books within it and

1829
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,527
The canonization if there's a lot of trouble.

1830
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:52,927
You don't even want to know what happened when they started printing it for everyone to read

1831
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:59,327
Cancel it. Joking kind of Shadow ban the Bible

1832
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
Bible traveled

1833
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:07,007
Same direction is born it traveled all through the same Underground

1834
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
Corn traveling

1835
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
System in the

1836
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
15 f****** hundred

1837
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,759
I don't know because we're in 20 21 blackjack

1838
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,039
That

1839
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:24,671
The end Was Not Mere in 2003 to as it were

1840
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,719
Yeah we were

1841
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,279
If so we got some

1842
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Cafe

1843
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,351
That's the trick

1844
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,423
It's so far-fetched when we reported

1845
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,471
But when they start saying it

1846
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,287
Seafood

1847
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
Everybody's doing it

1848
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,663
Online that we deal with everyday out

1849
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:54,367
In northern Europe

1850
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,183
Are only a few years away is already here

1851
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Crazy

1852
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:08,191
It went to Walter Cronkite or when somebody else gets up there are

1853
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,495
You know.

1854
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Dan Rather catch

1855
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:14,336
Cop or somebody like that

1856
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:21,248
If Walter Cronkite did deliver this news that we are a few years away from being the as

1857
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
Aztec Kingdom with human

1858
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,088
Sacrifice in Witchcraft and all this s*** I would say

1859
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
You crazy too

1860
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
I would not I would not give him

1861
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,208
You know why he's respected

1862
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:36,608
We didn't say s*** like that like that the reasons that people were like oh I can trust

1863
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
What's this person

1864
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
Not to say shh exactly

1865
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
Think that maybe there's

1866
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
Is a little bit of backwards

1867
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,800
He's so respected but if he's

1868
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
There were witches

1869
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Lake Nona.

1870
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
He's respected because he doesn't it

1871
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
And do that s***

1872
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
You could be

1873
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,224
You could be to have a better job

1874
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,784
I wish I had more recordings of like

1875
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,112
That type of old man whining of that like I don't

1876
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:01,184
Understand the children these days from from every era

1877
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:06,304
You know so I could just bring it like in in conversation with my family or anything like that

1878
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,840
Bring that out and be like

1879
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:13,472
Hey are you really mad about that is that a huge problem for you is that a huge culture issue that you needed.

1880
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:17,824
But they look at the other ones that you are just as important as is

1881
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,128
I think we talked about it before I even if Jeff

1882
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
Check myself a little bit about that whenever is there something that I just

1883
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Don't understand

1884
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
Tik-Tok

1885
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,272
Talk for me is a little bit like

1886
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
It gives me that

1887
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Sort of

1888
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
If I were

1889
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:34,464
A little bit less examined in my sort of daily life I might be like these

1890
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,560
It might be something that I would feel like

1891
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
This generation is really loss

1892
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,168
Recognizes her something

1893
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,960
Pardon

1894
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
I've been left behind

1895
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
That's fine

1896
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,152
I mean I just acted one of the major problems is that it seems like the generation after us is just

1897
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,992
They're just way better people they're more connected they're smarter

1898
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:03,392
I think it might be airing on the other side pendulum swinging a little too far

1899
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,928
I get that I get that

1900
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
But you know what

1901
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
You know Greta doesn't have

1902
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Mark on her

1903
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,072
But everybody else

1904
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,216
I've been talked about these microchips as a matter fact you realize that when Harry Potter first came to America as far as

1905
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
They sent out 300

1906
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
65000

1907
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Little

1908
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Stickers

1909
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,176
Can you do Harry Potter

1910
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,736
And it's a scar

1911
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,088
All these children got these little Bay stickers and they were all

1912
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
Forehead just like Harry Potter

1913
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,536
You start looking at that in Lion King Simba

1914
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
Annoying it on his forehead

1915
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
I shall

1916
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,496
News & World Report sometime I get it to go

1917
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Had a child lunch

1918
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Walmart right on his forehead

1919
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,152
Orca Browns forehead microchip

1920
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
I don't understand how we're also like getting

1921
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,320
So far afield from

1922
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Witches

1923
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
You know like

1924
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,208
This is supposed to be about witches on Halloween and now the Lion King is being used to

1925
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
Put forth a

1926
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,768
Microchipped

1927
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,560
Conspiracy like I really

1928
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
Think they lost the thread

1929
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,144
I think it would go so far as to be evident

1930
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
For them

1931
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,776
Not actually believing witches are real and just using it as a cudgel to get through their other more important

1932
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
Yeah it's kind of

1933
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:30,176
A splitter that they can use to have their other agendas

1934
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,320
Yeah I'll be more interesting

1935
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,880
Cool hey I think second amendment rights are important

1936
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Because witches are coming

1937
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,256
I hold on all right what else you got

1938
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
Also there a little bit of fun

1939
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
Because witches are real

1940
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,864
Maybe

1941
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
But they're a little defensive

1942
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
The people think the

1943
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
If they're bad

1944
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
Because they're against the witches

1945
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
Is or something so stupid

1946
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,360
And then all of a sudden they're not so bad

1947
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,272
There's a long time

1948
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,392
When they jump that line from which your make-believe for now

1949
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,952
Well so what I mean freedom of speech

1950
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,744
Dream of religion in America

1951
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,584
They're grabbing our kids and doing this well website Glory Ministries

1952
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,168
Stop, Lincolnwood on infowars.com what will you be doing

1953
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,496
Samhain this Halloween knife tomorrow

1954
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:33,152
Tomorrow night I will actually be traveling and I'll be doing some programs down in Florida

1955
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,456
And so I'll be

1956
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Mara

1957
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,112
It's not that I won't be praying about

1958
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
Things because I realized

1959
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,184
There a lot of children in

1960
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,512
And here's another thing even if Alex

1961
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
This was not an occult

1962
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,584
Practice and talk day

1963
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Anybody

1964
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
Take their children

1965
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,680
Neighborhood

1966
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,240
Taking candy from anybody

1967
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
Okay

1968
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,568
Don't trust

1969
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:07,968
Anyone where you supposed to be looking at community and neighbors and

1970
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,272
Okay

1971
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:14,368
Your neighbor obviously I do think sending a child

1972
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,208
A young young child alone

1973
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,000
I think that is dangerous hurt

1974
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:24,096
Reasons of liking you never know who's out there but they don't even front like what if the

1975
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,888
Trip and fall and hurt themselves

1976
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,472
You need to get it but that's your responsibility

1977
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,008
Apparent

1978
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,288
Now

1979
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
The other thing I think

1980
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:39,456
Is being very clearly intentionally misrepresented here in a very hilarious way is be like

1981
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
For the longest

1982
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,272
This time they said witches were bad

1983
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
But nothing and they're not real

1984
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
People would like oh they're not real

1985
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
And now everyone's like

1986
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Who cares

1987
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
About the cares

1988
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
Is not Society being like

1989
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,280
Yeah they do magic

1990
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,560
Alright

1991
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
It's been like

1992
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,120
Who cares

1993
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,544
Little different than Society just being like alright will accept it as a real and they do magic all the time

1994
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Don't worry about it

1995
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,360
Regulate cauldron sales

1996
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
Get the f*** out

1997
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,920
Yeah this is really dumb

1998
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,968
Yeah sometimes you know if

1999
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
See the thing about being a witch

2000
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,040
And I'll tell you this

2001
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,064
Is

2002
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
The only reason that they can believe

2003
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
Even witches

2004
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
And also

2005
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,464
Convincingly argue that they aren't

2006
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:26,304
Is that because there are magical rules

2007
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
That they themselves imagine exists

2008
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
Did they then impose upon which

2009
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
Like

2010
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,960
If witches were real

2011
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,240
Red magic is real

2012
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,312
Explain to me why eyesight important

2013
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,360
Or distance

2014
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:43,200
Or anything along those lines which was like holyshit

2015
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
Alex

2016
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,040
Is blowing the whistle on all of our which

2017
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,600
Let's take away his voice

2018
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
Biggest boils one day we have to go to the doctor

2019

Well you can be like not enough they can only do it if they have

Lock of your hair

2022

Yeah I'm either have to be limitations in order to make this

2023
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,616
Make sense within the actual world we live in

2024
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:15,200
Yes there has to be an explanation for why there aren't Magic

2025
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,736
Google things happening all the time

2026
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
If it were this

2027
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,808
Easy to learn how to do magic

2028
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
Score possible

Because it's f****** Magic

2032

You guys are not in agreement

2037
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,016
KC hat

2038

And all these

2039
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,648
Rapist in

Peoples Neighborhood

2041
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,912
Stats for 364 days a year we tell our children not to take anything from a stranger and then one night of the year

2042
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
We walk around

2043
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,216
Picking up anything that can

2044
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,568
Secondhand something

2045
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:20,992
For Halloween for little

2046
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
Portable skeleton

2047
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,416
Okay prove that lets

2048
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:32,512
See those law enforcement numbers if there's a responsibility

2049
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
You owe their poor little skeletons

2050
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:38,656
The coverage of this very specifically in order to get the word out

2051
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,680
About the evils of

2052
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,240
I guess Universal

2053
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
Kidnapping ring

2054
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
What's going on on Halloween

2055
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Now I think

2056
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
But this is really f***** up

2057
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
Because I thought this was about witches in Harry Potter and then she

2058
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,016
Apparently it's about your neighbors being

2059
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,296
Creeps yeah

2060
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,320
Yeah I mean

2061
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:01,440
I thought I'm supposed to be afraid of the occult not the predatory guy who lives down the street

2062
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Know anybody

2063
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
Twitch

2064
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,584
Culture

2065
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,608
Isolate

2066
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:11,168
From anyone who can disagree with you

2067
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
What is a

2068
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,240
If you wanted to say that

2069
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
The trick-or-treating is bad

2070
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
I mean

2071
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,592
Whatever you want to say about candy is fine

2072
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,664
Part of trick-or-treating is that it is a communal ritual

2073
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,456
Frightened that you go around

2074
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
Two complete strangers home

2075
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,528
They smile

2076
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
You smile

2077
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,600
They give you candy always

2078
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,928
Complete strangers either if you know people in your neighborhood.

2079
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,208
It reinforces

2080
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Community thing where you dress up and then

2081
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:40,864
People answer the door and they're like

2082
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,424
Good this is good and guess what else it is

2083
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,192
It's about

2084
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,496
Realizing that the people around you are

2085
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,056
Are just people like you that most of us

2086
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,128
Are f****** chill

2087
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:58,528
Except for

2088
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,064
Tri-tip

2089
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,160
Yeah I think the message is basically don't trust anybody

2090
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,952
Except those who would be willing

2091
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,096
Going to join in with our paranoia exactly have our community of paranoid weirdos who are scared of everybody else

2092
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,888
Cannot go meet other

2093
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656

2094
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,520

Perform human sacrifices

2104
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,288

2114
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
What we want to talk about mainly are witches

2115
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:27,616
Abortion is going to kill everybody

2116
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,920
Absolutely it's like

2117
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Are you

2118
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,992

I don't know

2122
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,880
I wonder if it's

2123
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,952
Function of like there weren't as many people listening

2124
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,232
So this is this

01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,768
Build swap

2126
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,120

2132
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
