Those tall things

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,192
Little bit

00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Feels good feels

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Important I should tell you that Marty DeRosa filling in for George day is sponsored by Dasani

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
But

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
When you hand

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
First

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Sprayed

18
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,112
And a lot of times with cuz of the parakeet novelty beverages I was pretty

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,976
Coconut

Yeah your kiwi sure coconut

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
It's going to take

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
It has that risk for sure

25
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,360
I got screwed recently because I'm

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,944
I'm such a sucker for anything that seems like that's different

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
Yeah I bought a 12-pack

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,088
But it was sparkling water

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Orange vanilla

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
I was like

31
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,976
I've never had a vanilla sparkling water is going to be crazy

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
And it was kind of gross

00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Bright pineapple

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm so Jordan is still in Mexico

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
He is on vacation

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
That's what I heard

37
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Instagram pic of him on the beach

38
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
But I trust him

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
I am so I could I you know

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
You & I we discussed

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Something we wanted

42
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
Sure which was

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
Pro wrestler extraordinaire was injured

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
We talked about doing a episode of that's what they want you to think

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Harold conspiracy theory podcast

46
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
And holding on to it for once he comes off the injured reserve

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Just celebrate his return

48
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
To the WWE

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,392
Episode

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
He's back

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
At 8

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
He's a he's a bad boy now right

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Even better than you

54
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Sure

55
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,360
Can all over the place to Sky music

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
Do you think that the hugger is going to go going to go evil

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Interesting predictions

58
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
About

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Sort of I don't know how you feel

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
My relief

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Not what it wants

62
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
Well this is one of the reasons why it's kind of difficult for us to get together

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,704
To do an episode of that's what they want you to think anymore

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Ostensibly sat down and

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
We talked about some sort of

66
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Conspiracy theory or paranormal type thing

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,200
I would research you would be like

68
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
The reality would always be disappointing behind the

69
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,112
The sort of fictional versions we have in our head

70
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
You never get

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Any

72
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Play finality any resolve

73
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Never also

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
A lot of it is like

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Well

76
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
If you break it down

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
And also

78
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
I feel like

79
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Yeah I'm just

80
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
It's like it was all the nuke

81
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Let's not

82
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
But people

83
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
I believe stuff the right

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Anymore

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
The other thing too I think about the

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
Stuff

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
Is that like we now know where a lot of it is gone

88
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
You know like a lot of

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,607
SeaWorld have funneled to like really ugly online world

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
And becomes

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
And s*** like that

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,079
Those girls murder out of it Slender Man

93
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Spaghetti

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Weird

95
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
What are they called

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,575
Creepypasta Creepypasta

97
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
You're saying it wrong

98
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
I'm staying wrong s*** all the time

99
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,143
Creepypasta spaghetti from now on for me by the way

100
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Itrade

101
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Most of Mike

102
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Conspiracy theory

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Series for a mortgage

104
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Gentle side of

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Abandoned malls

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Oh wow

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Like maybe

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
All the flagship stores

110
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
Is it still lacked much

111
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,351
Church's Chicken or the church

112
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
I guess that makes sense though

113
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
That present

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Canada

115
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Yang gang

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
He's malls

117
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
More than

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Amol

119
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
Haven't got no awareness of what

120
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,463
I've listened to that pitch I mean likes

121
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
Teach people skills

122
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,095
Lifelong learning

123
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
The fancy Mall

124
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Northshore

125
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823

126
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
And this mall

128
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Was interesting.

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
They a lot of the stores

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
They had laughed like big stores

131
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
I made like a virtual

132
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Reality play

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
1

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Was gone

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
They replaced it with

136
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Dispensary

137
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Music

138
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Play swear like

139
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Concert stage

140
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Your kids

141
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Can go there and

142
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Play

143
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Rockstar

144
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Sounds fun

145
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
That stuffy I watch instead

146
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Yeah who killed him

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
It's probably better use of your time

148
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,111
To some extent as opposed to like you hiding under your covers

149
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
You too much.

150
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143

My car blew up

153
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
And it caught on fire

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
It wasn't like that because

155
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,431
We were doing our conspiracy theory

156
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,575
The Lincoln Lodge in the show that week

157
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135

00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
I didn't have

163
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
Sort of rudeness to tell you what the time that I thought that was in second

164
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
You're an it sure

165
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
A lot of people

166
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
In it

167
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151

181
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Because I feel like the last

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,247
Different play yeah I think the last time we actually didn't

183
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Restarting to Denver Airport

And they take a picture

199
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,655
Deposition

200
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
I'm in the idea is that there

201
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
To telling the truth outside of characters

202
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
There was a a window

203
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Early

204
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Tended to

205
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Or 2,000

206
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
2000

207
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
Humana drug given drugs

208
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
Sleep through half of it

209
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Just real f*****

210
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,751
Triple H

211
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
I mean

212
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
He's so Charming so funny

213
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
No no

214
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Classic

215
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
He go to the Eugene

216
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,927
Not a big deal

217
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,535
Fellow Hall of Famer Drew

218
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Somebody

219
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
Bono and

220
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Cuz I just did a bike.

221
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Didn't have all the facts invest

222
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
We asked you and you didn't

223
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,391
You didn't want to do the shower and then block them

224
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
So

225
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
In the research they done they were

226
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Cute RV races

227
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Annabelle

228
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
No Macho

229
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
High School

230
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
And they were doing the pledge

231
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Allegiant

232
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
And there were

233
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Parts of it

234
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Topology

235
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,391
Dylan

236
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
There you go

237
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Never happen

238
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
For me to find another wrestler who's been on Infowars

239
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
And it's just you know it's no good

240
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Do you think they're shows that Jesse said no

241
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
I bet we could get it

242
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
I bet I bet we could get him I never Spark

243
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,463
The fun friendship with them then then passes away and then you write a book

244
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
829

245
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Or I can drift

246
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Say that he beat me up at a bar

247
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,775
Or I beat him up

248
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Not entirely sure how that check out

249
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,687
Jesse Ventura

250
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
I don't know I can't really find another wrestler

251
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
So what I was thinking is like what about Professor Griff

252
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Gosh that's no good

253
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Sounds like Billy Corgan

254
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Wrestling at the owner of the national wrestling Alliance

255
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Cupboard that is well

256
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
It sounds like we are really up against a brick wall

257
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,919
I found something that blew my f****** mind

258
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,247
Yesterday I got to give a shout out to a couple people who are supporting

259
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
The show

260
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,623
And we really appreciate the first of all Mike down thank you so much you are now policy walk

261
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487

00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Diet

263
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Name sound

264
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Could be wrestlers

265
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Everything about wrestling

266
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
But I do love a name

267
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
That sounds like

268
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
That's a wrestler

269
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Because

270
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
I was I was

271
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Sew-in Razor Ramon and

272
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Diesel

273
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Timer

274
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
They can't be

275
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Diesel RZR

276
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Character traits

277
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Somebody was

278
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
And then find someone

279
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Surreal memes

280
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Scott Holland

281
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Call of that

282
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,215
Those are really good names

283
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Like what are their names

284
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Scott Holland

285
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,991
Well there's that guy humorous right

286
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
What when Austin

287
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Hugh Morris

288
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
That'll be funny

289
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
I hated that I hate that name

290
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Drive me nuts

291
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
When Vince Russo humongous close

292
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Very close

293
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Vince Russo

294
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423

00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447

297
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775

298
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055

299
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
His idea

300
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Hugh Morris

301
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
To think about

302
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Really

303
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
And Vince Russo most of the stuff has

304
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271

In wrestling

400
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
It doesn't play

401
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
Unfortunately if you're a bad guy cuz then you're annoying the audience disrespect

402
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
I can tell Vincent

403

Am I still talking

404
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
When I say that I'm saying it

405
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Through the lens that I Nova

406
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
My comments about like him being a villain cuz that's annoying

407
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Stuttering

408
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Right

409
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Alright so

410
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Jack Swagger

411
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
So they grabbed

412
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Dutch mantell

413
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
My Farmer

414
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Wrestler

415
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Farmer Booker

416
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Besides helping

417
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Great there's a walrus mustache

418
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Zeb Colter

419
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Obviously

420
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Coulter

421
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
The dab

422
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
Uncle zebadiah

423
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
Ann Coulter okay she's a right way

424
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Clearly

425
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,735
The Japanese not very subtle they're not very subtle

426
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
You know

427
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Play Mohamed Hasan

428
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
The Middle Eastern

429
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
And all sorts of fun stuff

430
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
So

431
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
They bring them in

432
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
The promos basically

433
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Yeah we don't want anyone

434
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
They they have

435
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:29,311
A mirror of the rhetoric comes out they have the Semper Fi flag

436
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
Flag in the background

437
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,175
Did they put their head I when everyone in the building 2

438
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
To put your hand over your heart

439
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
The people

440
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Now in wrestling

441
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
When you have a fun chat

442
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
And you say it every week

443
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Andre Linda

444
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
People's heads

445
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
When they're at

446
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
What do you think they want to do.

447
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
So unfortunately eating out of his hand because

448
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
So what happened

449
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
All the sudden

450
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
The bad guy who's cutting promos

451
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
What about this Mex

452
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Chicken man taking our jobs in art

453
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
Titles

454
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
An hour

455
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
And you have 30

456
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
And they went

457
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
What they normally do

458
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Too hot

459
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Pivot

460
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
And they start adding

461
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Other

462
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,448
People I will ask tomorrow he's a foreigner why I don't know and then eventually they

463
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,800
When Americans

464
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
I'm blanking

465
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Del Rio with them

466
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
United me which is the thing that wrestling loves to do with

467
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Well if

468
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
If we're bad why is he with them

469
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
They were

470
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
They added the former enemy

471
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Yeah

472
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
What time it is kind of

473
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
How can we be bad

474
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
If he's with them

475
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
The real America

476
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
Cesaro in magic

477
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,552
Time I know it was getting

478
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Nothing with

479
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
With wrestling to especially back in the

480
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,000
There's no need for character consistency pledging their allegiance

481
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
Usher

482
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
This country is Wrong

483
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
Had you comes in and get your stuff

484
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Iraqi sympathy

485
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Don kernodle with

486
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
The Russian

487
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Or just free age

488
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Is that okay

489
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,368
See I think what you're describing in this storyline is like

490
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
After the point where at

491
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,656
Yeah it's fairly fresh

492
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Which

493
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Really

494
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Is when

495
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Outside of it

496
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
But like this

497
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
Being your people on Fox News

498
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
They're just like

499
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
That business strategy

500
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:26,976
Come up a little bit later

501
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
Cynical

502
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
So ironic

503
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Because

504
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
There's a wrestler in

505
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
Oh no I heard about that

506
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
He's cutting

507
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Kind of what could be

508
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Construed as white National

509
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Promise

510
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Which is like

511
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Good

512
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
You know they might have done a thing of like

513
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
My savant

514
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
See how it

515
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
Go see if we can get away with it if we can get away with it

516
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Because they want to

517
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Claim like we Mara Society

518
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Right and they've done it before

519
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,632
They've also done

520
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
That was that was right there

521
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,104
The nation of domination

522
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
I don't see it being so crazy for them to have a white nationalist character

523
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Your place yeah

524
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
Dover New York

525
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,864
European wrestler

526
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
What is not an act like my girlfriend

527
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Introducing

528
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
And she was like

529
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
Like his group is rink

530
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
Yes, General.

531
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah and I think that's the thing with

532
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
With wrestling is it

533
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
It's like saddle or something like that

534
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Orion trucks

535
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Contributor

538
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
She got in trouble for

539
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Goose-stepping in Germany

540
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Royal

541
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
4 Dead guys in a******

542
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
But they loved you pushing the envelope

543
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Like that

544
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
Going back to the Muhammad ahsan Khan

545
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
If you ever watch those openings like vignettes pleased to introduce wrestler

546
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Rudy's

547
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Little mini

548
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
Commercials for the wrestler

549
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
And they brought

550
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Mohammad ahsan

551
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
And Sean tavari

552
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
His manager

553
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280

You know

556
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
They brought them in after

557
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
You're too after

558
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
And at first it

559
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
It was kind of like

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032

564
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
It was just like

565
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
The music is exactly like

566
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Like the music in

567
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Team America

568
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
Evil bad guy

569
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
Just everything about that is

570
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Cringe-worthy

571
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
WWE Universe tends towards

572
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:18,496
Enter the WWE Universe sorry

573
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,872
Entropy towards minorities becoming Villa

574
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Without a lot of

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Careful attention

576
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,832

That's what I would say why I love wrestling

630
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
We would have had to wait this long for

631
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
And it would have been awesome

632
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280

639
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,248
He was always cute I like that that's a hover round

640
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,880
If cuz I mean he might have been the right guy

641
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,720

00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
The time was making

645
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Great again

Strategy

650
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,640
They are introduced as xenophobic

651
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,736
And there are bad guys to begin with

652
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,320
Popular

653
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
To the point where they do start getting a lot of people who are in that that sort of right-wing world

654
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:56,864
Yeah liking them them after release a video where they explained

You know

659
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
I've never seen anybody especially in the modern times and happen like that

660
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Which is another

661
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
Very nice. Shonda value I mentioned earlier

662
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Came out

663
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:37,568
Then they had to be like

664
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,456
Moments are real weird whenever wrestlers have to be like

665
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
Hey yeah I don't want to be killed for this I don't I don't want to encourage something really dangerous

670
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376

Hey it's Scott Levy the character I play the character of Raven I didn't mean to really crucify the Galaxy's heartless. Edited

682
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,936

683
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,408
Get baby girl I don't know I don't know what I would call Heat

684
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,248
They're complaining about complaining about

Got so f***** up in terms of

686
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Appropriate time

687
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,744
To break character and try and help people understand

688
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
This is storytelling

689
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
You're not supposed to like us

690
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096

00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Who's going to cover this

694
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,504
We've got a special interview L correspondent

695
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552

00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
He missed that opportunity

709
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
He could if he was willing to go on he was willing to kuttanad for the another one of those guys here back in the day

The gross character

731
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,552

RTD

761
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128

Don't do that and you know like stable came out in the Bikini they would put a potato sack

00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
Overbooking 2013.

782
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
He is picky about his appearance of either

783
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
By Sandy Hook families for his death

784
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,832
Amanda is harassing coverage

785
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:19,488
It is deposition Alex tried to play Down Tampa. Wasn't really an imp

786
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,680
Alex would have to come out and say that he was a quote bad person

787
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,288
Not entirely sure what that means I don't know how that's you're a bad person

788
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
How much are valuable

789
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,224
That's very childish

790
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
Tell everyone hear me

791
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Yeah

792
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,904
You can easily find a dondie's LinkedIn page if you want to by Googling it

793
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
If you do it appears that hasn't been updated since

794
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
What's 26

795
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,656
His username so is

796
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,752
I don't work at Infowars

797
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
17

798
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,760
Infowars reporters his

799
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
Is Heather is just an Infowars logo

800
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Now here's a new Twitter handle the real damper dandi where is bio says former Infowars reporter

801
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Ats-2070

802
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:35,008
In March 2014 testified in front of a Rhode Island state house meeting about guns

803
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,664
He introduces himself by saying quote my name is Dan patandi I work for infowars.com it's the number-one alternative

804
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
The media in the world

805
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
He goes on to yell at the panel for a quote

806
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
At which point he was told to leave the building

807
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,184
When you first started saying that I thought we can be a wrap

808
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,584
My name is Dan Vaden Taylor

809
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:05,984
Showed up and yelled at everyone around but it was a false

810
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Boston cuz I know the other guy went to stand

811
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,856
Walking around Boston

812
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
Centipede like this didn't happen a back article about guy who yelled back at him

813
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
How to protect

814
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Wolves

815
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
How can I write

816
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,872
I'm in July 2015 brine State Beach in Rhode Island

817
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,456
Branson beachgoers took place on the shores

818
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
He had an Infowars microphone

819
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:56,928
2015 Dan badonde made a submission video to be on the 6th season of WWE's top

820
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,488
Yeah

821
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
For the shop

822
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
We would have gotten a weird crossover between an Infowars reporter in a pre Velveteen dream Patrick Clark

823
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Hulk Hogan

824
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,872
Yeah well what's my little bit

825
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,200
Weird Firestorm of strange things

826
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
All this is today

827
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,744
He left his idiot run around to bother people at a Gallop Statehouse meeting

828
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
Because I created controversy attention and content for Infowars

829
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,656
Because Alex never gave a s*** about the consequences of his

830
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Or other people's Act

831
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm here

832
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
We find a bitter

833
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,080
Which I couldn't have imagined

834
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Can you try to be Russell

835
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Somewhere I reached out to

836
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Twitter in wrestling

837
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,256
I bet thousand in 4 years

838
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Is DMX and his

839
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
Dresses

840
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
Yeah it's still surreal to me though like I never would have imagined I don't know as much as you do

841
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
Like locker room stuff

842
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:20,128
You you're saying him and Cain were two guys were known as libertarian

843
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,016
Yeah you know I never would have thought that of the big valbowski

844
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,576
I never I never would have thought

845
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
The day would come when I would see

846
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,952
A wrestler who I was able to file

847
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Nothing that matters

848
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,448
Beginning

849
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
I will leave

850
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,288
For you of what's going on

851
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
Current news

852
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:56,991
Some recent news

853
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
Allison Croghan trucks

854
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:09,023
Mexican restaurant

855
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
Chewy

856
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Rush Limbaugh

857
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,855
WWE Superstar

858
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Okay

859
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,055
First of all what we get from that you're right

860
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,359
More wrestling videos

861
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Sounds like

862
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
90%

863
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
The wrestling podcast

864
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,575
Justin Bieber

865
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,903
Breakdown bra SmackDown

866
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,791
Guns

867
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
He has a laptop

868
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
I was on Skype

869
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
On this laptop

870
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,031
Video camera

871
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
A Dandy sitting next to a laptop if you look closely there's a microphone sitting next to the speaker

872
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
Audio recording

873
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
Val venis sounds terrible

874
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,607
Text terrible speaker on a cheap laptop

875
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Now

876
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,679
If you pay even closer attention

877
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
You notice that behind you notice that he's in a room that has glass windows

878
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,895
If you look through those glass windows you realize

879
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
He's at a public library

880
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,039
Wrestling posters on the wall

881
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
I really appreciate it room at a public library

882
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,767
Microphone next to the speaker on a laptop

883
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
If you pay even closer attention

884
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,655
You notice that right behind him is an old man a Google

885
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,495
10 pack

886
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
It's too far away to actually see what's going on

887
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
I'm left with the

888
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
Idea that maybe he doesn't have a camera

889
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
And the library has a camera that he can

890
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Okay

891
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,439
Or he doesn't have the internet at home and he's using the internet at the library in order to make this

892
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,023
Interview with the valbowski happen I believe all of you

893
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,839
I don't know what it is but whatever it is it's not good

894
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,703
Yeah it's not streaming professionalism our journalism

895
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Or anything like

896
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,823
I know it's tough and then also the quality is not good

897
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
Next to the computer

898
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:12,319
Like if I were Alex I'll be like look Val venis is a huge start this is a big guy and I'm glad

899
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
Came through for the Nightly News

900
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:21,279
The quality of this is no good

901
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Myself myself

902
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Also

903
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
Mr. Bernard

904
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
He was trying to make it seem

905
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
Like Alex

906
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423
Was

907
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
The top rapper

908
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Glenn Beck papers 100 slide back

909
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
Was the king of the castle at the time Glenn Beck was

910
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Red hot

911
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,735
And this was when he was riding High crying right now.

912
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:46,879
Chalkboard

913
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
Yeah

914
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:54,559
Price for it not yet and then made that public apology to her after Trump got elected

915
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,863
Become even worse than he used to be now

916
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
Notre Dame fat guy is a f****** a******

917
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
But again Alex now

918
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
No

919
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
Did this is classic

920
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,175
Is turning Alex into the main story but maybe Glenn Beck is far more popular than

921
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Yeah

922
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
I very much remember

923
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Basically

924
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
They wanted Fox

925
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
Alex

926
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
To give it away too much

927
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
But Val venis understand

928
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
And he explains as much

929
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,375
A little bit later and it's about this

930
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
But you know what they're doing

931
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,543
I'm about to have you tired

932
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
The Patriots

933
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
Wichita

934
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,535
I also forgot to mention that the Skype video Val venis

935
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
He's in a car he's driving somewhere else videotape

936
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Serious what are we doing here

937
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,639
Liberty moving right now at the Grassroots

938
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
So he's not happy about that but

939
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
My response to that would be like

940
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,959
That's the equivalent of some liberal or someone on the last being mad about Daniel Bryan

941
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:43,359
Akiko character parody this is storytelling this is

942
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:48,223
This isn't demonizing the environmentalist movement

943
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
These people are such snowflakes for sure

944
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
The wrestling characters

945
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,327
Like you said they're they're the true snowflakes in a lot of these senses of toast like

946
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
Volume

947
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Also

948
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:11,263
This Patriot movement that is based on the United States Constitution

949
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,359
Especially for America board for anyone else

950
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
Yeah very much a localizer

951
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Think they'll might have been one of the rest

952
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Also

953
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
Val

954
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Edge Chris

955
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
The Bahamas

956
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:31,999
That makes sense

957
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,071
He does say something or like there be at one point was like

958
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
Text Nicolette heck

959
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Break

960
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
Engaging with the truck taken care of each other

961
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
Send to talk a little bit about the

962
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Storyline

963
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,855
What's going on with swagger

964
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,487
Liking the story is a little

965
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
I have a couple of pieces of very bad news for Falconhead

966
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:01,343
First is at the border when people are

967
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
Stuff like that

968
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:08,767
For that purpose

969
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Bad news

970
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,935
Segments of the Tea Party

971
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:22,335
Not afraid

972
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,127
What you'll notice was a lotto

973
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
Wrestlers

974
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Time valve

975
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Probably

976
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
I mean I would say

977
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Still been

978
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
So interesting to tell kid one more run

979
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
End times

980
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Wrestlers who

981
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
At one more good run

982
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
Left them they won't go hard on the door

983
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
WV

984
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,167
You know very political because they want

985
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
They all wanted braces

986
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,983
They'll want that one last

987
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
So a lot of time

988
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
If you watch shows

989
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Nancy Grace

990
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Bedrock

991
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Stop

992
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Part of the company

993
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
Of course record everyday

994
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
That guy did a bad thing

995
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
Another never

996
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
Former wrestlers

997
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
You probably have some bad

998
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,447
Great company

999
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,079
And that's usually an indication that the

1000
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
You never know the WWE was the biggest game

1001
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,975
So I mean just from that perspective

1002
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
If subways

1003
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,839
Death of these folks

1004
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
WWE

1005
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,591
But you're hearing that from Val venis like some sort of settled down real hard on him praise something

1006
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:04,479
I like

1007
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
Didn't even have to say races

1008
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
That's true

1009
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
You know it's more xenophobic

1010
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,975
Then racist if if we're choosing

1011
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:21,119
I'm not I'm not positive I remember the entire Android

1012
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,959
You know

1013
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Writers in

1014
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
To racist

1015
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
At 1 are we still

1016
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,199
You know like this wonder if they are racist

1017
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,551
Find that hard to believe I bet there I bet they're there

1018
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Arguing over

1019
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
They scrapped the promos

1020
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Yeah

1021
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,535
Hey USA

1022
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Can we send

1023
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Okay

1024
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
I don't know

1025
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Teasing or not

1026
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
In terms of like why are you using Glenn Beck name

1027
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:11,039
And so he explains that exactly

1028
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,855
And there's an interesting irony that as he's explaining

1029
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
This phenomenon

1030
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,655
Darren mcbreen is facilitated by playing this interview that took place at a public library

1031
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
In a parking lot outside of

1032
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:34,335
Weather and making a big deal out of

1033
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,871
A story out of it

1034
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
Val venis distance

1035
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Like his

1036
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
Hey if I knock this out of the

1037
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
I'll be honest

1038
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
I would beg

1039
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:48,415
Two different just because of how little he seems to give a s***

1040
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
What it what does

1041
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Maybe

1042
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,279
I would have done better on

1043
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,607
I have no evidence that he ever actually made

1044
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
Brodus Clay Fox News contributor I almost did

1045
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Greg Gutfeld

1046
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
Are the red eyes help people getting it on show

1047
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
O'Kelly's cell pop

1048
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,967
I mean he's much better than a lot of other people on that show

1049
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,551
I watched a couple of his like man-on-the-street bit

1050
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,463
God bless. Val venis

1051
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,071
I explained a good marketing strategy

1052
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:33,983
Turn on Jack's light

1053
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,519
They are

1054
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Rush Limbaugh

1055
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,391
He is against the Federal Reserve

1056
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Yeah

1057
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:28,255
Clear Lake

1058
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
Of course

1059
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:34,655
Banba dandi Euro aspiring pro wrestler you should f****** get the business

1060
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,471
You should understand what's going on I swear when I

1061
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Talk Ali

1062
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Here are just like

1063
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
Ollie's rest

1064
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
Or like

1065
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
What's this on YouTube

1066
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
Hey Stoney the wrestling guy like

1067
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Unlike

1068
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Ben

1069
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:56,159
You think if if he was like almost a parody of what ya would be like it Infowars

1070
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:04,863
And they're burgundy and we can talk about the you know the Iron Sheik and that what he did for the

1071
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:11,263
The right-wing movements

1072
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,847
I will mention out twice

1073
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
People want

1074
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Alex twice

1075
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,343
Absolutely about Alex twice as much and absolutely

1076
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
Powerful that's

1077
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,439
You can't reach any other conclusion

1078
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
It's touch love me Daddy

1079
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:37,887
Reporting

1080
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Says like

1081
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
Talking points from

1082
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,407
I'm going to skip this next clip

1083
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,711
Come on let's hear it

1084
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,063
Val venis talked about some of his political beliefs

1085
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,879
Ask him about what he thinks about guns

1086
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
I thought I'd slip in

1087
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
Slam this weekend

1088
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:06,303
WrestleMania

1089
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,911
Do you want to know about guns

1090
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
Okay

1091
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:17,823
Super opposed to anybody having any restrictions on the right to have a

1092
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,895
Question

1093
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,495
Logic could be used to say

1094
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,519
Have no laws

1095
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,591
Attack anyway

1096
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
Right

1097
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Bombs

1098
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,735
Yeah but you know if you just only criminals will have bombs

1099
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
It's not a good liar

1100
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
Now we're like work that idea of life

1101
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Like

1102
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Wrestlers all got

1103
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Concussions at

1104
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
I not because

1105
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Wrestle

1106
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
Money from the dead

1107
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,303
Exit it's a dump

1108
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,327
Very considerate

1109
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:49,215
Chicago

1110
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,735
Isn't true

1111
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:05,343
There's a recent study that came out in out of Stanford 27

1112
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,391
There's a study that this guy did

1113
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
A name

1114
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,463
Looked at

1115
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Pass

1116
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
Right to carry laws

1117
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,047
Foregone

1118
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,071
They found it

1119
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
States average

1120
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
13%

1121
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
Increase in violent crime

1122
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:24,031
Excluding or other relevant variables like that in the years after they post it

1123
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
Or are they

1124
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,455
So these sorts of ideas about more people having more guns means less crime

1125
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,783
It just doesn't Stack Up in terms of the real world

1126
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
So

1127
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Switzerland

1128
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Cesaro Joy

1129
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
The Real Americans

1130
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,231
You nailed it

1131
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
It was not very funny

1132
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:48,863
The argument that they always have but there's no crime

1133
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
Whatever you think there's another reason

1134
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:10,367
3 PayPal

1135
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:17,791
PayPal

1136
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
U-val probably Alex promised to help it expand

1137
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,591
Sports

1138
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
I'll take care of it

1139
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,271
So it's important to remember that this is happening in early 2013

1140
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,319
Yeah which is really wild

1141
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:47,231
First of all

1142
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
Alsco

1143
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
You know what

1144
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,071
I could use a guy like

1145
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,423
I'll send him down there

1146
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
I'll take care of baby

1147
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
Yeah most people after

1148
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:05,151
Reporter contest a relation

1149
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
He hired an

1150
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
Badonkadonk or whatever his name is

1151
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:14,367
The guy in Seattle through the coffee on

1152
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,975
The pro wrestler I have wrestlers

1153
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Okay

1154
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:24,351
I knew that he was like a wrestling promoter and maybe a clown of some sort

1155
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,399
I wasn't sure

1156
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,495
Prove that it's fake but if you've heard I've heard from a search

1157
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Sources

1158
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:39,199
Okay I willing to believe that I have no reason to believe it was real but

1159
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Whatever

1160
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:45,855
Yeah do that that's what you would do

1161
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903
I heard so

1162
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,671
Vedonde

1163
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
Ask Val venis

1164
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,279
What the final thoughts are

1165
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,071
Wonderful groundbreaking interview

1166
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Glad you can see folks

1167
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,815
This is a debutante

1168
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:05,215
Clearly proved that the Liberty Movement is under attack by a character

1169
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,335
Totally

1170
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,407
I think that that last with those kind of like the best

1171
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,015
Indication of what you're talking about like Val trying to be like a little bit of a tryout

1172
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
Because that's that's pretty

1173
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,391
Real sure

1174
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,719
The idea that someone who has some sort of vague celebrity being like

1175
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
Yeah there should have been a gun at that school killed that kid who's shooting everybody

1176
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,655
I don't know

1177
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
I wonder if it hurt any

1178
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:45,919
I don't know I mean Willie Nelson smoked a lot of weed he still talk to Alex

1179
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,759
Jesse Ventura smokes a bunch of

1180
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,295
We still talk to Alex

1181
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:57,183
It all. Those two are people who don't put up with all of Alex's.

1182
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
You take it easy

1183
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:07,423
If you have any

1184
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
There should have been a gun

1185
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,495
Hook

1186
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,223
Teach finger painting or maybe multiplication

1187
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,039
Teachers that sugar

1188
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,415
Professor

1189
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,487
Horrified by the idea of like people

1190
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,839
If you had a gun

1191
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
We befriended

1192
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,191
Chicago

1193
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,007
Also great comedian has a bit about

1194
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
You don't pay me enough to

1195
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
Be armed and try to take out the buddy yeah it seems insane

1196
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,247
People have of like

1197
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
What the ideal situation is if that run

1198
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
I don't know

1199
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:07,327
What about a stray shot

1200
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
How do you say

1201
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Feel about

1202
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
Me know if you were

1203
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Defroster

1204
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
And these buildings

1205
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:20,639
How often should be arm wrestling at Madison Square Garden

1206
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
Allstate Arena

1207
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:27,039
Nearby Chicago if everybody had a gun

1208
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
The Georgia referee

1209
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
You know like

1210
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,183
Navigate to Farm down there

1211
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
Georgia

1212
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,935
Exactly

1213
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,799
But you'll never hear that all you'll hear from

1214
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,151
Beyonce's got armed guards

1215
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:58,783
Badonkadonk

1216
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:05,439
The argument about like people having arms are like celebrities guards and stuff like that like

1217
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,999
What the problem is

1218
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
It wasn't like off-duty cop social studies teachers their license yet

1219
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
Is Eddie's teachers and the lunch lady

1220
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,007
Right with God.

1221
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,823
Yeah we just had a guy at the hall of fame

1222
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Luckily

1223
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,271
You didn't have any weapons on a knife a gun

1224
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
Yeah

1225
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
It's crazy

1226
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,623
So that your final thought on Val venis

1227
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,695
I mean

1228
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
Course classic

1229
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:45,887
You know old wrestler a little bit of an audition for a job maybe

1230
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,519
I'm going to make sure I do all right I get my catchphrase in

1231
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,639
Cases about you

1232
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Set a table

1233
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
Short interview

1234
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Apartments

1235
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Thanks Val really didn't

1236
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:07,391
Give a s*** and wasn't very albatross around his neck

1237
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,975
Alex and then maybe just dance

1238
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
And Val pilot

1239
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
This is like a

1240
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:18,399
Every other wrestling d****** I talk to you

1241
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:24,543
Are you in the library it's just like

1242
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,871
Feeling when I listen to this of like

1243
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
At the beginning I kind of was excited

1244
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
In that restaurant

1245
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:44,511
Get your name out there you never know what

1246
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,143
WWE attacks

1247
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,031
Yeah say anything like

1248
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,847
Still available to come back

1249
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Martinez has been fun

1250
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:06,527
It's such a fun time

1251
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,879
Crossover of

1252
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,439
But there's a number of wrestling fans always get

1253
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,839
I get messages a lot of the time this is an opportunity for

1254
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
You can learn a lot

1255
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,655
From wrestling

1256
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,959
Alex is just

1257
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,751
To an extent you out there

1258
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
No doubt it

1259
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
Strategy of trying to get people to talk about him in order to get publicity what Val venis

1260
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Is exactly what Alex does

1261
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
Alex is like Bret Hart

1262
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
During the Stone Cold

1263
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Steve Austin Feud where

1264
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,367
Bret Hart was a bad guy

1265
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
But he was at

1266
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
Sekiro

1267
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Alex

1268
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
Is bad guy

1269
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,815
Lavender outside

1270
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,399
Everyone else

1271
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
That person but you people

1272
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
You all know

1273
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,823
You good American Patriot good fight for being attacked

1274
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,871
By Zeb Colter in

1275
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
I'm doing the right

1276
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
Flattered

1277
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,575
This is a good way for me to also

1278
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Symbiotically get press

1279
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,927
Because they've said my name

1280
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:23,327
The opening to attack they'll probably makes

1281
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
How to send the wrestlers

1282
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
Another show like

1283
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
This week

1284
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Good morning

1285
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,287
I don't know if that ever happened

1286
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
Not men stupid

1287
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,711
He never comes on Alex's

1288
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Again going back

1289
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,807
Real Americans once they put out that video.

1290
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
That pretty much

1291
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,415
Hey man

1292
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Yeah

1293
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
And what's what's temperature

1294
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Sing to me

1295
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,679
Is that why this is early 2013

1296
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,751
Not pretty soon

1297
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
In art

1298
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
Covering

1299
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,103
The Fallout

1300
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,407
January 8th

1301
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,943
Corso

1302
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,991
2013 right now

1303
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,783
But this is coming up soon

1304
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
Zip codes are in Jack Swagger doing this stuff

1305
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,159
We're going to get to see how Alex respond

1306
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
So that'll be coming up

1307
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
In the 20

1308
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,255
13 investigation

1309
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
I'm excited to see how that plays out

1310
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Right angle

1311
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Exciting

1312
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,263
What's up

1313
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,895
All over the place

1314
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
One.com

1315
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,479
Protect me.

1316
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,039
Grumble grumble

1317
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,647
What else you got

1318
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Go to Twitter

1319
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Yeah

1320
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Fan of the

1321
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Thank you

1322
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
About that I want

1323
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
I said you know

1324
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,551
I know you text me Alexa

1325
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,367
No

1326
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,671
Great

1327
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Grapes again

1328
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,511
How do I sound like a week ago

1329
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,567
We got to get out of here before we do

1330
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Somebody

1331
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,223
Albivis probably not killed anybody

1332
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
Probably not

1333
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
You know what

1334
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,087
Cesaro definitely has not killed somebody

1335
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,159
Even though he swings people around like crazy

1336
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,231
I can go on the record

1337
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,327
Del Rio who-knows-what Duchess done back in the day

1338
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
We know what I can

1339
