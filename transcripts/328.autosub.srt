1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by now it's bright I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Just a little bit

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
About Alex Jones

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Indeed we are. Jordan

7
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,104
It's good we got some flowers popping up on the Toronto and Thai chili plant

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
Not particular that one you're staring at there but this one's got some flowers on it I have some on my

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Kitchen windowsill

10
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,392
Those are some flowers but no as of yet

11
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Nicely there's no real updates to make I'm glad you're asking me about the plans a little too often

12
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
It was in this apartment

13
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,040
But unless the next guy is late

14
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
I'm getting excited to actually probably

15
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
I don't know what I'm going to have the time

16
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,536
Because we're in a little bit of a you know a crunch-time right now it's show and stuff

17
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
As soon as I have a little bit of x

18
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Everytime I'm going to head back down

19
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Home Depot

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
When I get a bunch more

21
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
But probably known vegetable play

22
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
Grow a tree

23
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Little doors

24
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
I'm just going to buy a little a little

25
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
You see there

26
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Thinking about expand

27
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Hangouts

28
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
What it what is pasa

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
No talk about growing some wild grasses

30
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
Possible

31
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Amaranth

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Yeah that might be tough but I am going to explore some new thing

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
That's what

34
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
Appliance interested to know when they're done

35
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Dino Network never done

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
What is that when do you play

37
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Verified

38
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
A lot of the time will come in

39
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Will turn red

40
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,240
That way but you know you just a little bit

41
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
I know enough about plants

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,384
To get by

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Exactly

44
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
Jordans

45
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
To cover March 11th and 12th

46
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
The 23rd psalm

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
A part of the reason for that is they we record on Sundays usually

48
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
Earlier in the day to noonish

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
I'm still

50
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,072
Right now with the situation that we have in front of us

51
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Terrible

52
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
Stuff happening

53
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
In the world

54
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Elpaso shooting or

55
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
The shooting in Dayton

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
And I know a lot of people want to know what Alex

57
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
To take on it is

58
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
And so far Monday episode there might be an expectation

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Can the people have of like

60
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
Oh they're going to cover this

61
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Like we're going to react instead

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
82

63
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
I think it's wise

64
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Thrustmaster leave

65
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Tunis jerk

66
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,815
And assume what Alex's narrative is going to be although it will leave at the globalist or behind us

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
In the middle of the day I was hasn't done his Sunday show

68
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,311
Because of our schedules are really a lot of

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,431
For us to cover mature for us to try and do that for Monday

70
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Impossible

71
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,807
For us to do that on Wednesday on Wednesday

72
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,927
So that would be that put out

73
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,999
But 16-minute video on his website

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
On Saturday spending state-sponsored terrorism

75
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
It

76
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Waffling

77
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,007
It's very much like allegedly this guy

78
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,615
Using allegedly

79
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,503
Alleged shooter

80
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
I listen to that I didn't think there was really enough to

81
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
To give anything

82
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Worthwhile

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
In terms of an owl

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Informed yet

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
And we'll know like I don't know if we'll even really be all that concrete maybe it will be

86
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
But Monday Tuesday shows wolf

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Definitely where he starts

88
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
Especially because when he recorded that Saturday shows before the shooting

89
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
We didn't even have that

90
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Add to weave in tonight

91
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Whatever you going to bring

92
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
For the table

93
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
I just think we can do a much better job

94
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Never do that Wednesday

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
So I apologize if anybody was hoping we could do it today

96
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Sorry

97
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
No no the we can't be held to that

98
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
I kind of

99
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Time

100
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Otherwise we just do it

101
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
Before we get to today's episode

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
March 11th and 12th

103
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
We

104
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407

Taxable income

120

00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm a policy wonk

122
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Heroin

Pizza dude

129
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
Can do that by going to our website

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Dysport to show

131
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
We left off in 20

132
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Alex was on a large vacation

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
He had been gone for over a week

134
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
And so we took the opportunity

135
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
To delve into

136
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
David Jason Christian identity preacher

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
I have been listening to for years

138
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
And so now we jump back to when Alex

139
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Gets back from vacation

140
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
March 11th

141
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Studio

142
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Is

143
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Rusty

144
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,791
Music

145
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Okay he's eager for The Fray

146
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Headlines

147
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,975
When I get to work I'll just pour over

148
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Frustration

149
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
You know why you got to pause there cuz he was about to say It's A Beautiful Mind

150
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
He sits around and reads headlines and makes

151
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
Tenuous connections between things

152
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
That's what he say

153
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
You're pouring over headlines

154
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
And not

155
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Anything else

156
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,295
I rid of headlines at hoping

157
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
It's a stand-in

158
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
So this this characterizes

159
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
The beginning of the show

160
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
He's a guy

161
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,327
I'm all over the place do I cover I am out of my mind

162
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,191
Here we go we get to what his headline

163
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
He is actually really interesting

164
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Sing because

165
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
There's

166
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
A really good story he could

167
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Tell here

168
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
But instead he tells the wrong song

169
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Let me just try to go over the stacks

170
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
How's that sound

171
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
Images start to figure out what stops

172
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
Stop story

173
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
The.is on the road

174
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,807
Veterans for food

175
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Such a touching amazing

176
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
You really tell that Alex is kind of rough

177
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Be here because

178
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
He's back from vacation

179
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
And you know his mind is still in Barton

180
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Springs or wherever he went

181
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
He's spinning his wheels known as a big pile of paper in front of him

182
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
Momentum carrying over from the previous day

183
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Generally speaking what is show has like

184
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
You have these narratives that you built yesterday build upon

185
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Or you pivot from

186
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Being in his show but when you come from a queen break

187
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Plus

188
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Breakers

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Hit the skids

190
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
For any narrative

191
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
He was spinning before

192
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
His big gigantic investigative report that he was

193
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,943
Do you realize that he's just completely forgotten about it.

194
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Piers Morgan having Michaels

195
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Plus he was gone

196
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
He's got to get going from a

197
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Standstill

198
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
This is how that looks

199
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
FairPoint

200
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
I bet he doesn't just take his news is talking points

201
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
That is fair

202
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
Though it's just covers what

203
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
Multiple times

204
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
He's just reading headlines from

205
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
From drugs

206
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
In an instant

207
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:05,503
It is all too rare almost completely with Alex

208
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
It's ridiculous that this homeless man accused

209
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
And got a ticket for Scavenging for food in Accra

210
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
That is Tara

211
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
However when we start

212
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
Examine what we think about the situation

213
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Agree with Alex

214
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Is it this is government tyranny on display

215
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Take on it is that when humans are eating out of trash cans

216
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
We have a problem ticket for it or not

217
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
Alex doesn't have any solutions outside of just saying the churches in

218
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Charity should voluntarily solve

219
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
The problem

220
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,039
As if those groups already aren't already making large contributions

221
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Housing and feeding those experiencing homeless

222
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
He refuses to accept that there's a better solution

223
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Because the actual solution

224
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
It is completely against

225
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Political beliefs

226
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
And Houston

227
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Is actually a

228
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
In 2011 Houston reached

229
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
In terms of the homeless population

230
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
8000

231
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
500

232
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
38

233
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Adjectives rules

234
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
About sleeping in public

235
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,615
Scavenging for food we're not having the desired effect

236
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,735
Ultimately those rules just criminalized homeless you end up incarcerated

237
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Most people would cost the

238
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
The taxpayers more

239
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Giving them tickets I can't pay which can ultimately

240
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Incarceration

241
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
Or driving them off to some other city where they could become someone else's

242
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Problem

243
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
None of the possible outcomes of that strategy

244
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
The offers actual solution

245
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
And Houston learned that lesson

246
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,983
In 2010 the Department of Housing and Urban Development at chosen Houston

247
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
The priority

248
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
Based on its high rate of people living without home

249
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
They took the time to analyze the issue

250
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
To set up some infrastructure then in 2011 they began imp

251
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
And their plans have paid off

252
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Massively

253
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
In 2019 the rate of homelessness has dropped

254
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Houston by 54

255
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
The federal assistance

256
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
And most importantly a coordinated approach

257
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Since 2012 Houston

258
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Has housed approximately

259
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
17000

260
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
Mike Nichols interim CEO the Coalition of the homeless in Houston

261
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Harris County

262
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Told the Texas Tribune

263
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
If you have a homeless person

264
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Put them in

265
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Supportive Housing

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
And simultaneous

267
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Play give them social behavioral and health support serve

268
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
92% of them will be

269
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Bi-stable in that facility

270
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,927
Houston represents a model of people interested in homelessness and housing issues

271
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
But learning anything

272
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
From a distance

273
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
But the federal government should

274
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Do anything

275
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
If you're supposedly Auntie home.

276
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Government

277
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,519
And you learned that Federal coordination and eight is been shown to be incredibly effective in a dress

278
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
What's the problem

279
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,663
You have to either drop your anti-government position or accept that you really don't have that big of a problem

280
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Not having anywhere to live

281
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
I suspect this is the case for Alex

282
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
This isn't a story he's covering because

283
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Because he cares about this man

284
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
He just sees it as an opportunity to use

285
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Misfortune to attack the government

286
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Which I think is very

287
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Shity

288
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Also the charger

289
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,607
Dropping in Savannah

290
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Houston where made

291
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
These Parker helped Usher through repeals of laws that criminalize behaviors like

292
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
That we're kind of archaea cold overnight

293
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
To begin with

294
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
What you have here is a really into

295
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Study that Alex

296
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Not interested in

297
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
At all

298
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
A very successful strategy

299
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Has been used

300
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
To effectively

301
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Help people get back on their feet

302
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
Pennywise

303
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
So

304
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
It does seem like the cruelty is the

305
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
Forcing people you know the rich

306
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Starve the poor in

307
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Two doing what they were

308
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
The right Behavior

309
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
It's just so f****** stupid and

310
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,919
Cool because I don't think that's what's motivating Alex here at all I think he doesn't care about a

311
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
Holistic approach

312
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Cruelty in 2013

313
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
I think it's based

314
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
His desire to demonize

315
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Is government

316
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
But that's his priority

317
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Maybe he would be like f*****

318
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Especially Frozen

319
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
But it's

320
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
It's interesting to see

321
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Did the cruelty doesn't provide nearly a

322
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Is much kind of like

323
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
The basic

324
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Human empathy

325
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Come on

326
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Diving in a dumpster for

327
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Food

328
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
He's starving and you guys are going to

329
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
300 bucks

330
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
It's kind of an elementary level of it

331
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
And I'm sure he never got back on there and gave

332
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Like a clarification

333
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
But like

334
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Yeah it is still coming from a place

335
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
Close to where you'd wanted to be

336
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Again

337
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
Surface-level on the right side effects

338
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Explain to the people like

339
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
You cannot explain to them that it

340
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
It's cheaper

341
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
To just

342
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
How is homeless people

343
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
They didn't have to have this like

344
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
Well it's unfair because I

345
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Pulled myself up from my

346
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Bootstraps or whatever the

347
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
The f*** they want to do

348
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Yeah buddy

349
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
It's just

350
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Fuk reggae

351
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Eclipse coming up here from

352
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
March 11th

353
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Like the content of it

354
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Does not matter

355
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
Don't worry

356
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
I don't know how often I am worried about the content

357
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
That's fair

358
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,535
These are not these are not consequential stories

359
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
But they illustrate

360
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Something about her

361
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
His style of

362
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
That I've always wanted to kind of

363
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
Straight but

364
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Really good

365
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,895
Example clips that are just like of him

366
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Here is Alex

367
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Reading a headline

368
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
And then Patrick himself on the back

369
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
You covered a story

370
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
This is a 20-second clip

371
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
New York New York

372
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Adam frasch

373
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:16,191
Support.com

374
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
Basically read a headline

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Sort of

376
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Speculated about other things

377
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Alright alright

378
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Just reading from drugs so we're doing we're doing a lightning round of headlines and he's like

379
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
We're playing we're playing speed chess

380
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
It's pathetic

381
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Empathetic

382
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,567
Like without any like he doesn't read the first

383
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,199
At least the first line of the paragraph

384
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Behind it why is this interesting

385
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Nothing

386
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Alex

387
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Alex

388
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Excuse still got it

389
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,535
He's talking about the immortal cell line

390
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
The researchers have

391
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Very complicated and I don't want to get in

392
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
I believe we talked about it and fast episode is Alex

393
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
His take on it is

394
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Very stupid

395
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
But

396
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
This is another thing I wanted them

397
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Which is

398
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
We talked a lot about how Alex

399
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Cannot stop siding

400
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Movies

401
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,087
But what's interesting is he's also often defensive the people think that he gets all of his ideas from movies

402
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Course he is because he does

403
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
So this clip is really fascinating because

404
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
You starts off

405
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
Talk about this Immortal cell line

406
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
This Lazarus cell

407
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
I know y'all are going to think that I got this from

408
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
And then watch where this clip go

409
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Okay

410
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
He doesn't

411
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,175
Well Mountaintop

412
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Humidity

413
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
I want more

414
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Alex

415
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Set Blade Runner about

416
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,335
Legend ionotropic

417
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
I would only be better if it was like

418
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:10,015
I'm talking about the Omega Man

419
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
Also makes me question

420
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
You know what did Blade Runner come out 20 years

421
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Before this

422
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
Like he's talking about the globals put out white papers 20 years before

423
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
What that was mid-eighties right I think so

424
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
I don't know

425
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Too hard to say but I just

426
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Crystallize that thought process

427
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,872
Movies

428
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
What are the globalist want they want more life and I'm going to cite a different movie he can't get away

429
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,904
I guess to be fair he's not getting it for my omelette

430
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Insanity

431
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,280
So when I come back from vacation

432
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Right

433
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
He's been out of Studio but

434
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
He got back on Sunday

435
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
I listen to that episode and we don't have any clips of it

436
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Because it was generally

437
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Just incredibly boring

438
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
To do with him getting into a little bit of a

439
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
The fight

440
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,504
The cops it's up by Southwest

441
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
So I don't really

442
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
I don't want to take too much time on it

443
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Justify

444
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
You went up South by Southwest

445
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
And he was trying to hand out copies of his Infowars

446
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
If you believe his version of the story

447
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
The out-of-control cast

448
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
You can't have bumper stickers on his car

449
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,568
Which is clear evidence that we live in an out-and-out police station

450
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Except this tyranny

451
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,480
And the police pack down cuz they were afraid of him comes up first

452
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
That sounds true

453
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Most likely what actually happened is

454
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Police told him that his car was clearly a commercial vehicle and that that he was promoting

455
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
Products and that was prohibited in the area that he was in without a permit

456
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
Aveeno different if you was a food vendor parked somewhere without proper permitting

457
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
And giving out free sample

458
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,032
His van didn't have to have just have a bumper sticker probably a bun

459
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Maybe even a side.

460
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
They're probably in the back of the van

461
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
It's not like they could just be walking around carrying

462
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Tons of magazine

463
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
I don't see the reality of the version

464
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
He's telling

465
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
But

466
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,184
He claims that he got into it with these guys were trying to give him a

467
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Tikahtnu got back down

468
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,048
Episode Alex embellishes disturb

469
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Even further

470
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
To the point where now he's arguing that his action

471
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
Caused a Revolt within the police department

472
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,384
Police revolt

473
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,248
Did the police chief overthrown

474
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,120
Canterbury impromptu / demonstration

475
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,856
Yeah production meetings will help us show the news

476
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
Victory over censorship it to urinate

477
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,976
So he's has an employee look it up and it turns out

478
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
End up covering the sxsw

479
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,400
Issues people getting threats for it

480
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
When they actually find the story

481
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,104
Enforced during sxsw

482
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Oh

483
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah I'd certainly.

484
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
This is

485
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,264
The story about a singer-songwriter who is giving out flyers for a

486
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
In the area that sell pie Southwest

487
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Like4like doesn't allow people to give out flyers

488
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
Okay and we're going to give him a ticket decided not to

489
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
The story was covered in the CBS article

490
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
That's an exciting story

491
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
0 mention of Alexander

492
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,400
In the news

493
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
That's kind of a problem

494
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,496
The little I forgot it's a little bit of it

495
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,592
Dick move to be like if I was running a comedy show and somebody came in

496
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
And stood outside

497
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Gave out flyers for a

498
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Comedy show across

499
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
It is a bit of a dick move run there

500
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
Sort of talent relations

501
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,720
You can find about them blacklisting people

502
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Performing in Syracuse

503
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
In the city during the festival that aren't approved

504
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,424
You know there's all kinds I don't know if I 100 percent sign off on

505
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Anahi

506
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
I think they do

507
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
The same thing there's so many bands that

508
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Just do not play in

509
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,384
Chicago unless they're at Lollapalooza

510
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Play do Lollapalooza

511
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,760
For the greater art

512
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,856
It's just that

513
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
I am four

514
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,560
Legos magazines else for a soul revolts if they are

515
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,912
Put on Alex's generally that's probably a good thing

516
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
So

517
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:28,128
Alex was on vacation may be right around this time is over to North Korea

518
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Is pretty mad about this

519
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
One of the things that I wanted to highlight

520
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
Particularly of this episode is this

521
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
2013

522
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
Years later he's going to be thrilled with Trump saying he loves Kim Johnson

523
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
I just think that it's really interesting

524
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
To see how much

525
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Alex

526
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,360
So here is Alex talking a little bit about

527
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Towards

528
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,792
Love to get my Roomba.

529
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Power

530
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
I'm sorry

531
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
Torture and

532
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
You should stop

533
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,128
A person who you're going to

534
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,712
Define d'etat.

535
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
This is like somebody if you want your graphically fantasizing about killing with your fist

536
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
And who you know

537
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,536
Whether or not they soften their presence behaved in such a way in the past that you could not accept them

538
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Is the one who you can have relations with

539
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Yep years later

540
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,496
If you want that I love him

541
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,920
What's Lowe's give John Lu and now it's just a disposition

542
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Different

543
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
It's so different

544
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
It's crazy

545
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,624
It's insane

546
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
If everything

547
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,376
Everything we do it's like with Trump's tweets whenever everybody's like

548
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
Trump says this and then you can go back and find

549
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Tweet from

550
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
The Obama years wearing

551
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Exactly what he's doing

552
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
Is 100%

553
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
It's just such

554
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
Like let's say a politician that we like

555
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Wins and

556
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,576
20 a year later all of a sudden there like you know what

557
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
Fuckingawesome

558
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
It's not like we're going to then on the package be like guys Alex

559
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
But like

560
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,632
You know advocate for a position that were explicitly again

561
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
Ghetto Lovett Elizabeth Warren gets elected and then she's like

562
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,760
He's into this government going to ramp up separating children from their parents at the border there's no way I'm supporting her that's

563
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't you know

564
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Alex

565
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,976
Rodman for going over there which good on him

566
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
I guess

567
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Put

568
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
Do you whatever I have a problem

569
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Looking at

570
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
What

571
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,624
Oh my God

572
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
I can't handle this

573
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
No

574
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
Glycocalyx

575
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
Has has really embraced that the United States is worse than North Korea right now

576
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
The policy of separating children from their families

577
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
I'm putting them into a different crime against humanity

578
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
Good people at ice and Border Patrol

579
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,544
Videos and they really do have an evil demonic looking

580
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
As an assessment of people

581
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
Probably less important

582
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Sharing a meme of

583
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
Alexandria ocasio-cortez

584
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
And there

585
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
It's it's

586
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Actually

587
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Shocking

588
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
Here it looks like parody

589
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
You just couldn't

590
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
It would be lazy writing if we if I was going to write a f****** SNL sketch

591
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:23,456
People would be like f*** off that's so unreal is backstory of a propagandist defending X

592
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Yeah yelling about

593
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
In the past is just

594
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,184
These stores examples are are

595
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
It's so common

596
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
It's literally

597
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,632
It just indicative of how little he cares

598
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,240
So you talked a little bit more here about North Korea missiles over there

599
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,312
Blowing up on the pad

600
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
At this point

601
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
And Alex believe

602
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
I can play

603
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
He knows

604
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,112
These are not

605
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
These are not

606
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Missile problems

607
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
Matthew McConaughey is not in

608
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,864
They are being shot down by lasers

609
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Body to you

610
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
It is

611
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,984
Cuz this is the same sort of argument I've heard from people

612
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
But Alex knows it

613
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
He has some

614
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Proof

615
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
Which leads to a very

616
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Weird person

617
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,872
Aircraft

618
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
Armor

619
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
No school

620
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,432
Small particle

621
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Burned

622
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
The front

623
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,056
I think your dad was lying

624
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
I'm excited for that special on lasers

625
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,320
Special

626
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
Dead

627
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
He's going to get to those articles

628
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Don't know if I

629
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
Story but with

630
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Interesting about it is I don't know who the liar is

631
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,472
How is his dad told him that story needs repeating it

632
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Color to it

633
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,080
Because I could believe his dad when he was in high school was in

634
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
To science

635
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,432
Stop

636
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
Some sort of a science path

637
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Like low-level experiments with

638
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,928
Not not a f****** rails on laser

639
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
Experiment to maybe one of them blew up or something

640
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
But the embellishment

641
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Alex

642
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
You know if we hurt him

643
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Instantly

644
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Hero Worship in exaggerated his dad's

645
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
He's there

646
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Second

647
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Smartest person in the state of Texas the globalist right-hand system

648
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Stories of websites

649
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Experiments that he did when he was younger

650
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Turn this into

651
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,416
He was working on a particle beam and it's burned his eyes

652
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
I mean it also would make sense for the father of somebody the person who created and

653
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
Alex Jones to be also a pathological liar

654
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
Sun is in the cross

655
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
In the cross

656
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Cuz he never comes

657
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
We have very little insight

658
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,480
To like what he's actually like

659
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
For the HR Director to go on

660
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
Bonaire

661
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,368
This point I don't think I will

662
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
Accent Dental

663
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
I think so

664
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
I'm not tired Alex's little buddy about the timeline

665
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,840
Retired because of Obamacare

666
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Either way

667
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
We got some more about North

668
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Alex has

669
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
Couple of bold claim

670
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
About North Korea here the first one has to do with

671
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Food

672
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,280
Another world

673
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
I don't know if

674
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
I believe that

675
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
He is saying that the

676
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
Country of North Korea is

677
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,304
State shoes actual cannibal

678
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
This is very reminiscent of

679
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
Sort of old timey

680
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,776
5 use of Colonial Country

681
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:13,920
1607

682
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,016
Alex

683
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Yeah that's

684
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
I think you've used like North Korean

685
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Another

686
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
American

687
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Comes over and

688
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,304
Carrots and that's true

689
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
Yeah I don't know I don't know how much

690
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
I believe that

691
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
So you got this

692
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
And then

693
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
You got

694
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
This last clip

695
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
Where Alex talks

696
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Kim Jeong Hoon

697
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
And

698
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
I would say

699
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,664
Enforcing the idea

700
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
No matter what happens

701
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
We can't

702
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Really rationalize

703
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
Coming to any kind of agreement

704
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
There's no way for Alex's position in 2013

705
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,648
So Kim Jong is possessed possibly Vice 8

706
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Right

707
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Probably

708
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Absolute

709
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
Okay I don't know I don't know about this

710
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Eunos

711
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
The North Korean people aren't

712
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Break

713
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
Desiring to annihilate North Korea

714
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,344
As opposed to them I think he was mostly talking about

715
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
The people in charge he was talking about

716
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Everybody in North Korea

717
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Misinterpret

718
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
It's okay

719
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Stupid

720
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
I'm about to

721
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,592
Not just Kim Jong-un but also the people

722
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
In the police

723
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Resources

724
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
So you might of heard

725
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
A person that the background there Soto

726
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Chiming in

727
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Michelle

728
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Kind of like that

729
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
Answer welcome

730
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
Hi Alex how you doing

731
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
I'm in this new show for about 2 years

732
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
I'm only 14

733
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
And

734
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
Absolutely loved loved your work

735
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
You do excellent job

736
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
This is when you get this person off the phone

737
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
14

738
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
If you listening for 2 years and loves Alex

739
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
A twelve-year-old is not equipped

740
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
To deal with

741
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
The sort of

742
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
Understand what Alex is talking about

743
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Even from just a surface

744
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
He's not

745
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Capable

746
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
Deciphering Alex's light

747
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
It'll probably doesn't have access to the

748
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Like the abilities

749
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
Emotional maturity

750
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Required to

751
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,991
Understand is really dangerous

752
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Well we CRV

753
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
Honored

754
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Now we see what happens when you

755
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Children

756
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Exposed to this

757
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Kind of right-wing

758
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Papa

759
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
And I was at

760
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
What else what else have

761
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,863
If a twelve-year-old told me

762
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
440 drilled

763
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
Steven told me that they liked our show

764
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
What I would do.

765
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Yeah and I would tell them

766
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,335
Don't let them listen

767
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
Like if you want to listen to the show when you're older

768
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
We need listeners

769
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
I'll be around in 8 years whenever words appropriate I would prefer to have less listeners

770
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
Then the people who are not able to

771
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Understand

772
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Because it's

773
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Such a Negative

774
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Unintentionally

775
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
Probably

776
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Maybe

777
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Influence

778
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
This kid can't integrate this

779
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Information

780
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
It could lead him to making

781
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Decisions litter

782
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Dangerous

783
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
Just for us but for others

784
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
So his whole call is about how is Utah

785
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
To channel is B

786
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Just kind of weird

787
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Metallica

788
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Complains about it

789
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Hellboy

790
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Astoria

791
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Something about

792
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,351
Posted that video of George h.w. Bush saying New World Order and got it with

793
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
Copyright claim

794
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Try to moderate

795
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
You know you doesn't mean when you have a 40

796
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
18 year old calls in who's gung-ho for what

797
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
You need to talk them down a little bit

798
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
Bring them to irrational Center

799
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Supposed to be like

800
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,599
Yeah you know they are trying to take out the little guys on YouTube

801
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Feed into it

802
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,255
Hey Alex I am filled to the gills with hormones

803
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Control or under

804
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
Understand forcing me to make

805
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Decisions that I'm

806
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Certainly going to regret later

807
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,191
As do all human beings

808
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Especially

809
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
Teenage boys

810
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
So please tell me

811
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
Direct

812
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,967
Thank you I will

813
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
So we're done with the 11th now we get to the 12th

814
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
I think it's clearly indicative of Wyatt twelve-year-olds

815
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Not be listening to this show

816
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,679
One of the founders of

817
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,023
We'll see

818
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
Percent

819
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
So Professor Griff

820
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
May or may not be on the show

821
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
I don't want

822
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Ever

823
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
For a twelve-year-old

824
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
To hear professor

825
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,175
Listen to Public Enemies album by

826
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
Don't Listen to Professor Griff

827
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Will get into later

828
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,879
Rear spoiler alert Professor Griff

829
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Okay but that that's

830
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
The kind of show that we got here

831
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,047
Professor Griff is going to get none questioning and

832
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
Really

833
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:01,471
Celebrities who were

834
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,287
So marginalize that they're willing to talk to him

835
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
Professor Griff is one of the most important people in here

836
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:16,063
Which is a necessary thing for him to say because he's the person in hip-hop who will talk to Alex

837
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Manager

838
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Now thinking about it in the

839
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
The very beginning of the show

840
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
Every has that violin

841
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
F****** fantasy of beating up

842
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Kim Jeong Hoon

843
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
And you think of a twelve-year-old listen

844
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,263
Sing to that sing this is legitimize behavior for an adult

845
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Like it

846
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Awful

847
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
Everything awful

848
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
The cycle

849
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Masculinity

850
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Never end

851
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
So in this

852
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Alex

853
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
How is

854
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
True

855
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
Listen to it

856
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:00,863
It is. He's just misusing time

857
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,679
Yeah you could easily get that

858
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
To get out easily

859
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Available

860
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
But

861
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
You want to extend

862
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
On the show because

863
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
You'll see

864
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
Sponsored

865
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,463
Skip Network brakes

866
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,471
Go back 45 hours

867
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,055
No

868
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,391
Wheels behind wheel

869
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
So this is a really interesting

870
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Sing Clips to me

871
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
Coming up from Alex

872
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
More and more

873
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
2013 Stratus

874
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
He knows he's right about every

875
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,431
And he's super f****** frustrated because no one else

876
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
I think that he's right about everything

877
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:27,391
One conclusion a person that situation could reach is that they're not in fact right about everything at their feelings that they are

878
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,255
Alex is unwilling to consider that possibility so he goes the other route

879
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
There's just too much news

880
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
Struggles of being a radio host

881
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
Screaming

882
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
He doesn't have the time

883
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Explain it all to people so they can be

884
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Be free

885
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,751
Here's how I know he's full of s***

886
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
He's been on here for like 18 years of this

887
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,919
He's had plenty of time to explain the globalist plan in exhaust

888
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,271
Hayden Park literally all the information clear as day

889
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
I bet he is right

890
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,903
If you wanted to he can take an entire week of the show and just get into the weeds with it

891
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Like really lay out the names date

892
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
Specific citation

893
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
That would be 15 hours on air

894
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,607
And if that isn't enough he can go into overdrive

895
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
He is literally no one stopping him

896
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
A broadcast

897
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Exactly as long as it takes

898
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
Coherently

899
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
You're missing it Dan

900
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,871
The globalist

901
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
Wrinkles

902
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
You can never the plan

903
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Timeless

904
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
The reason he doesn't do this

905
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,623
Is that he doesn't want to show his cards

906
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
His audience knows where he's getting

907
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
His ideas from

908
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
Some of it's just made up

909
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
Some of it's clear misrepresentation.

910
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:42,655
The things that are real comfortable with his just the protocols of the Elders of Zion

911
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:48,543
Alex knows damn well that he can just yell about Carol quickly or John P holder and then move on to another topic

912
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
Without anyone getting too suspicious

913
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,407
But if you were really to dive in and try to analyze those Tech

914
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,759
His point is argument would crumble in real-time in front of his body

915
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,367
The second reason he doesn't do it is that it would be painfully boring to the audience

916
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Cities cultivator

917
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,951
People you talk to whoever listen

918
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
To Alex's show

919
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
I don't know if I agree with him

920
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
It's fun when you yell

921
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Alex knows that

922
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Keeping audio

923
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Which allows

924
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
Continue making ad Revenue

925
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
He needs to

926
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
2 gallon distract

927
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
Jump from topic to topic

928
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,663
He needs to keep a steady supply of white identity fueled outrage coming in the form of misleading and over over Lisa

929
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Simplified headline

930
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,551
If you really buckle down and tried to get into the details he knows damn well that have his audience

931
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Turning the dial

932
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
And there go as planned

933
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
To buy a new boat

934
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,463
Market pressures dictate that in order to maintain his standard of living

935
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Try to take the time to

936
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Explain the quote unquote

937
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Playbook

938
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,887
But he's convinced himself he understands better than anyone else on Earth

939
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
There was a time when that wasn't the case

940
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,311
It is early days on radio you so much for your unbeholden

941
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
These advertising

942
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Compressors

943
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Here's what I'm getting

944
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,199
He's had a radio show and a video cam

945
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
This whole career

946
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,855
If it any point you wanted to lay out his brufen actually do a focus

947
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
Coherent type of

948
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Breakdown of this

949
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
He absolutely good at

950
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
And Jackie Heather

951
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
Endgame was an attempt

952
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,351
I guess he is completely full of s***

953
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
And fails to prove any of his

954
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,959
If anything in what he was saying we're true

955
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
He could have done this at any point in the

956
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,823
His life it's not like the global is playing is some new

957
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,151
You're bringing up like all there's this new thing but those are all just

958
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,735
Wrinkles those are all good to stretch the base of it is the same

959
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,527
It's always been the same

960
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
There's nothing that he's doing now that he couldn't

961
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
I'm 10 years ago

962
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,927
In terms of verbally laying all this stuff out

963
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,231
Yeah it does seem that he is

964
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
Fully aware that he is

965
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
His show is

966
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
Purely enter

967
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Entertainment Valley

968
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
That he is

969
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Peking

970
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
White nationalist

971
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
You can't ever say that it's an end

972
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Because that would undercut so very proud

973
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,479
Very clearly aware of it

974
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,831
Probably a little too sensitive about this but clips

975
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Really piss me off

976
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,415
Because I think they show how much of a con man

977
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,743
And he is possibly even more so than is gross like sales

978
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
Man clips

979
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
Explain why why is show isn't

980
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Pretends it is

981
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
By creating fake

982
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
Excuses for why he's not doing a better job

983
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,775
He can't fully explain the globos Playbook to you because

984
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
He has to plug sponsor

985
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,847
Presumably bikes

986
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:35,199
He hasn't already fully laid out the globos Playbook because every day comes into work

987
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
The last date

988
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
18 years

989
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
He's had to plug

990
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,135
In reality he hasn't explained his globo's Playbook because he knows that he's making most of it up

991
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
The wheels inside wheels and plans

992
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,487
Inside playing these the globalist cramping

993
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
Our tenuous connection

994
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:55,423
But he imagines lurking behind completely unrelated headlines he scammed in an altered state or whatever he was describing

995
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
All that stuff is in his head

996
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,287
So he doesn't lay it out

997
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
If he did

998
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Be too obvious two people

999
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
Bakon stupid evil

1000
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Continuum hair like

1001
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
McHugh's he's clearly scamming

1002
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:14,111
He's aware of it

1003
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
He said yeah

1004
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
To give you pause

1005
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,695
The depths of evil

1006
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Could be so

1007
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Yeah like the most

1008
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
Evil parts

1009
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Seems like they could just

1010
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Just be like

1011
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
He doesn't he doesn't

1012
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,167
No mental process

1013
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
I swear he's like oh I can't

1014
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
I can't lay out my plan because if I do have one

1015
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
He believes that he can't lay out his plan because

1016
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Cuz he doesn't have enough to

1017
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
Right I do think he believes

1018
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,551
Subconsciously creates all these

1019
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:49,439
Impediments in his way interview

1020
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
Lynbrook soap guy

1021
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Again

1022
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Limerick

1023
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,191
Throw the globalist plan

1024
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
But

1025
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,079
He's like maybe I should extend the show because then I can get into everything

1026
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
And I'll tell you this

1027
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
He goes for hours on this

1028
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
We'll see how that plays out

1029
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,479
Every production

1030
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
Thought he has

1031
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
24-hour Network

1032
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
Don't don't do it you're overextending yourself

1033
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
Bad idea

1034
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,607
So we'll see we'll see what happens

1035
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,655
What that final hour where are you know

1036
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
He's already

1037
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,591
Get into 12

1038
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
So Alex

1039
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Has

1040
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
Start sex

1041
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
A little bit and

1042
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
This episode

1043
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Already took

1044
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,567
Look up

1045
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,415
The old-timers

1046
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
We held it

1047
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,983
So

1048
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
About to

1049
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
Department memorandum 72

1050
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:45,407
277 but it's a long it's been a long time

1051
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
A little brush up

1052
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,599
Entire back catalogue

1053
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,719
777 was a document that was drafted by the US state department and released

1054
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
In September 9th

1055
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
61

1056
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,327
The official title of the document was freedom from or

1057
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
The United States program for generally complete disarmament in a peaceful world

1058
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,983
It's important to read this document with two consideration

1059
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,567
The first is that this is a cold war-era

1060
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,151
The point was to provide a possible plan of action

1061
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:17,919
To the UN

1062
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
The 16th General Assembly

1063
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,503
And hope the beginning of fruitful negotiation

1064
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
With the Soviet Union

1065
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
Mutually assured destruction

1066
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,391
We've mentioned it

1067
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
Legitimately on the brink

1068
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
The world ending

1069
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
In the span of those years

1070
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,815
People saw it is the highest priority to avoid that pain

1071
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Possible outcome

1072
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,167
If we live all of us if we all live in Peace by way of

1073
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Complete disarmament

1074
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Why the f*** would we do

1075
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,543
It's better better outcome and everyone dying for no reason

1076
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
I remember the guy in the Soviet Union who received

1077
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
The medal for literally right

1078
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Tiger Earth

1079
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
And then was

1080
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Hidden in Siberia and

1081
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Story

1082
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
The f****** suppress

1083
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
For as long as

1084
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,743
Humanly possible

1085
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,583
There's nothing dangerous about that I don't I don't I don't

1086
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,375
Understand why when your advisor

1087
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,911
Situation where you have Brinks

1088
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Skip going on

1089
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
Two nuclear Powers sewer

1090
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
At odds with each other

1091
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,591
Explore every single possibility

1092
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
To avoid that outcome

1093
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
It boggles my mind

1094
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
That happen

1095
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,503
They didn't immediately go

1096
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,319
Buy one f******

1097
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:34,463
Computer area we almost destroyed the world we need let's start back up

1098
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,791
World

1099
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
The 2nd

1100
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,631
Consideration is that when negotiations began

1101
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,703
This plan was not what either the us nor the Soviet Union

1102
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
Wanted

1103
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
At the 16th General Assembly it went nowhere and wasn't

1104
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Adopted

1105
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,103
It exists today as a historical test

1106
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,967
To a time when International negotiations might start off on a farm or idealistic step

1107
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
Do today

1108
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Zoe

1109
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,879
The place and ultimately the meeting was

1110
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,279
Play some important groundwork toward later negotiations like the nuclear non-proliferation

1111
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Treaty of 90

1112
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,887
Important show of goods

1113
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
Make the world a safer place

1114
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
I think that

1115
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
If you look at it through that historical context you

1116
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
Theaters

1117
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Like a

1118
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,175
Probably a very important document

1119
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,479
Has life too good

1120
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
But not something

1121
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
Enforceable in any way or actually

1122
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
Carried out

1123
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Resolutions

1124
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
Involving the United

1125
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
We didn't do a goddamn

1126
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,071
It was a suggestion

1127
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
Of course

1128
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,679
It's unclear from the text of the memorandum even affect citizens weather

1129
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Pens at all

1130
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,263
It's really mostly about disarming the US and Soviet Union

1131
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,127
Strengthening the UN peacekeeping Force

1132
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,943
Ideally avert future large-scale crises

1133
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
Between countries

1134
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,783
And that also does have a nucleus

1135
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
States

1136
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
Not pursuing nuclear weapons

1137
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
This memorandum 7277 is used

1138
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
Second Amendment dum-dum is proof of

1139
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
International conspiracies

1140
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Get their guns

1141
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,607
So they can create a one world government in the form of this UNP

1142
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Peacekeeping Force

1143
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
None of the arguments they make

1144
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
Be supported by the text of the memorandum

1145
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
Rely entirely on their interpretations

1146
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Which I personally do not true

1147
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,127
You got to read between the lines

1148
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,151
Trust

1149
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,711
Literally any word in those document

1150
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Cuz they all mean

1151
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,759
The exact opposite

1152
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,039
Of what they say they make

1153
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
Which I

1154
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,599
Happened to determine what that mean

1155
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Playbook

1156
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,695
Let me read between a couple other lines

1157
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:48,095
Alex is playing with John Birch Society and the old-timers were warning about this which is interest

1158
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Phrasing

1159
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:55,519
John Birch Society brought it up before this point but the earliest definitive time I can find them talking

1160
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,567
About memorandum 7277

1161
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,103
Is president

1162
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,967
Former Alex Jones guess John McManus brought it up in a John Birch Society Bulletin

1163
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,807
Titled whose side are they on dated April 1991

1164
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
I thought you were going to say

1165
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
This specific the president not the president

1166
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,631
According to John Birch Society lure Robert Welsh

1167
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
Quotes

1168
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,751
Copy of memorandum

1169
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
Because they works

1170
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
Publicize it

1171
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,383
The plan behind 7277

1172
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Always

1173
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,711
I find this particular telling of the story to be hard to

1174
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,575
Partially because from my reading of John Birch Society materials they're pretty big.

1175
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
And also their own stories

1176
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,719
That's literally

1177
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
John McManus

1178
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,535
Uses the word somehow found a copy

1179
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
That seems out of their Style

1180
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Precision of the

1181
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,703
Timeline the McManus presents about this

1182
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,799
To be clear I'm absolutely certain that the John Birch Society was at

1183
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,383
Agitating about memorandum 7277

1184
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,711
I don't have any concrete proof of exact

1185
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
Italy when it started

1186
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,599
I seen some indications that Robert Welsh was aware of 72 7790

1187
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
But he wasn't the only one

1188
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
I can find concrete

1189
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,255
That another group was organizing

1190
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
Specifically against memorandum 7

1191
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
1277

1192
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
At the same time or earlier

1193
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,935
I swear to God if you say the KKK I'm going to be

1194
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Furious

1195
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
It's a group called

1196
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
The Minuteman

1197
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,799
They're almost worse

1198
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
Yeah

1199
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,383
Jesus Christ they're f****** crazy

1200
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,919
The Minutemen word extremist

1201
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,503
Anti-communist group Ran by A guy by the name of Robert Depew

1202
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
If you'd been a member of the John Birch Society but decided that they weren't into action the same way he was broke off and started

1203
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
61

1204
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,047
That didn't stop him from a full trading the John Birch Society with his men

1205
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
After the fact

1206
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,679
This is actually a common strategy explicitly violent of the day

1207
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,495
The Congressional Record for 1960

1208
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,639
Record for 1963 and crew includes

1209
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,711
Introducing into the record of passage from The Crossing

1210
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
The flag

1211
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,575
Quotes followers of mine who has access to our literature should a temperature

1212
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,111
Society meetings in their community

1213
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
Do not be aggressive it did not be offense

1214
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:25,023
Did I do anything to embarrass the birth leadership but always have a pocket full of literature

1215
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,047
And materials which

1216
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
You can hand out to interest

1217
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,399
People who might want to make a deeper study into the Communist Menace

1218
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
And also always

1219
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Have a few Blow Pops

1220
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,775
Send your pocket

1221
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,431
The more extreme groups all the John Birch Society is fertile recruiting

1222
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,247
Sense of humor out there enough to join to JBS

1223
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,831
You were only a little nudge

1224
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,135
Yeah in many ways it's like a fascist

1225
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,207
Confuse things like gamergate men's rights activist communities

1226
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
As recruiting

1227
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,023
But drives this strategy is timeless

1228
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
Yep

1229
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:02,399
It should be noted as of the cross in the flag was a publication put out by Gerald l k Smith

1230
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,703
The founder of the America first party

1231
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
Which of the party that was supposedly just like the relationship

1232
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
What was crawling with Nazis

1233
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
And Nazi sympathizer

1234
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,895
In 1944 the party advocated for the

1235
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
Deportation of us Jews

1236
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
And the sterilization of those who would not

1237
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
Smith himself was an outright.

1238
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,855
After World War

1239
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
For the pardon

1240
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
Nazis convicted at Nuremberg

1241
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
PopularMMOs

1242
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Yeah

1243
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
Popular move you got it

1244
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,375
I'm not saying you got to give it up to the Somali pirates

1245
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
A certain type of

1246
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Encouraged

1247
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
Laabee4

1248
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Nazis

1249
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
Courage

1250
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Courage

1251
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,847
So you ran for president and got less than 2,000 votes in

1252
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
1944 election

1253
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,759
From the America first party you renamed it the Christian nationalist

1254
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,575
Crusade under whose name be published across the flag

1255
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,879
Which is what was putting the Congressional Record

1256
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,207
The Christian nationalist Crusade also published Henry Ford

1257
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,487
International Jew

1258
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
And promoted

1259
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
Protocols of the Elders of Zion

1260
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
Absolutely authentic

1261
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
They hated Jews

1262
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
Communism immigrants

1263
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
And Jazz

1264
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
Presumably because

1265
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
Is it had to do with black

1266
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,031
Okay Smith wasn't.

1267
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
And he was one of the main figures behind

1268
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,127
The early days of Christian identity

1269
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,943
Christian nationalist Crusade is also

1270
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
Associated with

1271
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:26,111
A 1964 news article describes minutemen's founder Robert depuy as quotes

1272
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,183
Black-haired Missouri

1273
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,767
Which I only mentioned important to realize that the media has always done

1274
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Everett Clinic's

1275
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Who's coming and probably already here

1276
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,423
All around

1277
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,727
That's the only thing to do is to organize gorilla group

1278
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
To fight back

1279
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,543
Naturally this just turned into a

1280
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
Anti-government fanaticism

1281
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
Terrorism

1282
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
Because it always does

1283
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
On January 26th and 19th

1284
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,735
The 87 Minutemen members were arrested

1285
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,063
Planning to blow up the city hall Police Department in power station

1286
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,343
Redmond washing

1287
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,183
Arresting officers found firebombs Dynamite blasting caps

1288
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
Guns and mask

1289
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
They plan to use in their campaign

1290
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
Supposedly against communist

1291
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,631
It came out in court this is all part of a plan to cause

1292
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,191
Distraction and Chaos that could Rob for area

1293
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
I bring in about $100,000

1294
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,287
Robert depuy is charged with

1295
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,079
Conspiracy since he was the group's leader

1296
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,639
But he went into hiding only to be taught in charge tonight

1297
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
69

1298
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,711
Because he was the leader of the white terrorist group

1299
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
Though he only ended up serving about three years

1300
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,343
Is 11 years old

1301
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,415
Marijuana possession

1302
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,231
3 years war white National terrorism

1303
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
2 years

1304
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,303
Prior to that

1305
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
Broken up

1306
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,143
19 members of the Minutemen were arrested in process

1307
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
Carrying out a terrorist attack on some cat

1308
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
They supposedly

1309
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
In the Northeast

1310
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,591
The police been tipped off and raided their cell location

1311
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,431
Quotes these dumbasses arsenal of mortars grenades

1312
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,759
Machine gun semi-automatic rifles at close to a million rounds

1313
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,087
These people were not trying to fight communism

1314
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
They were extreme right-wing terrorist

1315
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,207
Rampart's quotes that detector of the group is saying quote

1316
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:11,327
After you take their five phases of training you find out do you want to overthrow the government by force

1317
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
And violin

1318
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,911
About half of the people in the United

1319
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,239
What is allegedly started out as a defensive

1320
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Fraternal organization to fight off the coming communist

1321
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Invasion

1322
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,383
Had to turn radical and offenses

1323
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Lynette Invasion never came

1324
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,735
They had plans to assassinate politician

1325
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,807
Chemical weapons attack on the UN building

1326
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Rationalize

1327
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
The government was the

1328
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
The same as attacking communist

1329
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,951
Since the government was already

1330
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,767
It's proven by everything that's happened since the New Deal

1331
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,839
Put simply the Minutemen were Alex Jones at

1332
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Kind of guys

1333
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,911
But he does not want people to think they were his

1334
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Guys

1335
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,543
After their formation in 1961 and quickly became a catch-all organization

1336
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,151
Been dead for people all over the extreme-right who wanted the possibility of violence

1337
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Their life

1338
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
As well as playing members

1339
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,343
Coordinators for the Minutemen were former Grand dragons

1340
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,975
The clan their membership rolls also included an interesting overlap with members of the Church of Jesus Christ

1341
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
Christian

1342
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Which is run by weslee

1343
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
We swept The Man Who Bore left

1344
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
Created the

1345
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
Christian identity movement

1346
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
One of his ministers wasn't

1347
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Man

1348
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Not a coincidence

1349
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,055
Much like the John Birch Society the Minutemen distributive publication

1350
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,383
In this case however it was

1351
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
You know stuff like a handbook

1352
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
The Top members how to make incendiary weapons

1353
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
Vehicular buying

1354
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,319
Recipes for Molotov cocktail

1355
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
The nerve gas

1356
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,135
Just sort of the things that the Minutemen were

1357
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,719
They also put out a periodical called On Target

1358
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,047
Ontarget I'm not entirely sure was the first

1359
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,583
It is very early

1360
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,631
The publication that was spreading

1361
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
Conspiracy the number random 72

1362
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
277

1363
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Wasn't app

1364
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
Take Americans guns

1365
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
Amber first 19-6

1366
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,591
C3 issue is titled quote new Drive

1367
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
Disarm America

1368
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Symposium

1369
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
That was held to discuss illicit International arms to

1370
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
The publication makes a specific point

1371
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,855
That the attendees were all members of the Council on Foreign Relations

1372
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
And I quote

1373
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,671
People who spoke during

1374
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
A four-day conference

1375
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,255
Nearly all fit into one of the following categories

1376
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,559
One known and identified comedy

1377
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,911
Two persons who have belonged to and supported numerous, Communist front

1378
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:27,263
People who have made it a habit to support and be affiliated with various ultra-liberal

1379
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
Peace and disarmament group

1380
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,871
And for individuals who are paid employees of us.

1381
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
Given how loose we know their definition

1382
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:39,807
Communist is those were descriptions could literally include everyone who's not a minute man

1383
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,647
Complain about memorandum 7

1384
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
1277

1385
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,463
How everyone getting their guns taken

1386
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:51,071
No it's going to happen in the next thing you know we got a new world order going under the UN

1387
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,631
1/4 five-and-a-half of the

1388
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
And pages of that newsletter

1389
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,495
Is just the names at home addresses of people who attended that arm

1390
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
Armstreet supposed

1391
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,311
Which leads me to another important part

1392
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,127
Doxxing is not a new strategy of the extreme right

1393
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,711
Important to recognize it when Alex Jones says

1394
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
Things like the old-timer

1395
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
This is probably who he's talking about

1396
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,855
Probably talking about the Minutemen

1397
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
A dozen tainos

1398
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Not to bring up there by name

1399
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
Also back to memorandum 72

1400
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,559
That Plan was introduced by JFK

1401
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,911
How is it possible for Alex to argue that JFK was both the president who introduced

1402
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,519
The globalist disarmament plan for Global government and also the guy who killed by the globalist

1403
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
For being the last real president

1404
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,127
Things like this to really highlight how ink

1405
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,663
Alex's conspiracy

1406
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
These are even

1407
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
To each other

1408
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Yeah but that's never been

1409
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,135
The point is always

1410
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
It's always been

1411
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
Whip people into a

1412
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,767
Fear-based 8 so they'll join us by saying

1413
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
This is coming

1414
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,351
And then whenever it doesn't come because

1415
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,167
It's Fantastical it's already here

1416
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
That's that

1417
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
So what

1418
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,103
The entire point is

1419
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Insane

1420
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,455
Yep and it does go to the like using

1421
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,479
John Birch Society

1422
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,551
As a recruitment place for more extreme groups

1423
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,879
Like if you're in for whatever Alex

1424
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
Cuz selling it really doesn't

1425
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Matter if it's

1426
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,023
You know like you're already in the place where you are

1427
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
Self-selected

1428
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Bulshit

1429
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
So why

1430
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
Care about this thing

1431
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
Making sense

1432
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,471
Both

1433
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,007
Heroes killed by the globalist

1434
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,591
For being into America and to the one who introduced

1435
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
The UN plan

1436
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
Disarm the entire world

1437
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Doesn't matter

1438
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
I just think this is

1439
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,271
Sing because

1440
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Things that I

1441
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,319
Want to

1442
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
Pay closer attention

1443
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,159
And really highlight more

1444
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Is this

1445
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
Prince's wear

1446
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Alex has Direct

1447
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Overlap

1448
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
With these

1449
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,583
More terrorists

1450
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Pick sides

1451
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Of the

1452
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
World

1453
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
In the sixties

1454
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
Because there is

1455
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
Very

1456
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
Very strong overlap

1457
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
Society is kind of

1458
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
Given like

1459
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,199
Review Loki Oliver

1460
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
What's fascist

1461
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Cosmetic and was one of the founding member

1462
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
Where's the John Birch Society

1463
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
Like there are connection

1464
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
So

1465
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,535
At this point episode Alex

1466
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,863
He's failing time

1467
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
Professor Griff is coming

1468
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:39,775
Probably malicious s*** I got to wait until Professor Griff

1469
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,103
Signal to the militia is I've complained show

1470
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,759
Not long enough so I can't get into the global

1471
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,215
Not allowed

1472
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,503
Professor Griff on the other side

1473
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
.

1474
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,623
So Alex introduces

1475
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:46,335
Alterra

1476
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:51,711
First things first Public Enemy was formed in 1980s

1477
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,039
Successful group

1478
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:59,391
With the 1987 release

1479
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
Which is well received critical

1480
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
In between the release of that album and their second album

1481
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,631
Professor Griff interview the UK

1482
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
4 days

1483
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,495
Also quote Jews are responsible for most of the wickedness in the world

1484
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,775
Which many people suspect

1485
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
Gordon Henry Ford

1486
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,359
He's medical application the international Jew

1487
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:24,735
Took up arms when Israel and killed all the Jews it would be alright

1488
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:29,087
Professor Griff unbridled bigotry got him kicked out of the group right is their way was

1489
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,719
In the aftermath Griffith played the role of pretending to apologize we could be Public Enemy

1490
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
What is Minister of Truth again

1491
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:41,119
As recently as 2018 he's made public comments about Ashkenazi Jews as being in

1492
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Musically evil

1493
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,215
And that it's just common knowledge now books about

1494
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,799
I'm not sure if I believe you would ever sorry for any of the awful ship

1495
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
Absolutely

1496
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
I don't believe

1497
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,711
Incidentally and that interview reference term 2018

1498
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
The book

1499
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,063
Common knowledge

1500
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,791
No I don't have the time

1501
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,863
Quote this book lifts the lid on the conspiracies

1502
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,911
Details of how the public has been duped

1503
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,007
It includes the complete Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion which is

1504
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:24,895
Which is a big scoop as the Jews do not want the general public to know their plans for world domination

1505
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:32,063
Can we get a copyright takedown of is is

1506
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
I don't know if anyone owns the copyright

1507
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Ford

1508
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Ford Probe

1509
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,607
I looked into it a little more and what do you know what are the arguments put forth in that book is

1510
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,703
The people alive today who call themselves

1511
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,751
Crazy to hear Professor Griff a

1512
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,775
Promoting

1513
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,639
Spread by people like Pastor David jsnip

1514
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,199
At the heart of the Christian identity

1515
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Weird

1516
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,319
Putting up to their first album 1987 does Public Enemy in the earlier part

1517
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
Hip hop history

1518
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:09,183
But there are a lot of people came before them by Grandmaster Flash

1519
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Kurtis Blow

1520
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,023
Run-dmc's first album came out 3 years before public and

1521
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:18,655
Stressed out

1522
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:23,519
Second wave of the evolution when the old school Aesthetics branched off into town

1523
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Subjonctif

1524
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
When it takes

1525
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
That was the

1526
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Cement Batman

1527
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,223
History level about

1528
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
Professor Griff

1529
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:41,183
Before it was that for you

1530
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,815
You didn't come to the surface until a couple years ago interview actually

1531
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
We came out

1532
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
And you got in trouble and then

1533
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Groupon

1534
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
Chucky brought him back Munoz

1535
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
Newsradio

1536
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,823
Sure

1537
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,175
Alex

1538
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
The

1539
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1540
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,831
Man

1541
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:13,183
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1542
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,351
So that's born in 90

1543
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,703
1874 it would literally be impossible for him to have been falling assessor grits

1544
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Since he was 11

1545
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,031
Considering Public Enemy didn't form until 19 a

1546
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
3612

1547
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:33,151
I have a hard time believing that Alex has an eleven-year-old a super intuitive

1548
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
You're a member of the nation

1549
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,967
Islam halfway across the world

1550
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:41,343
But I guess you can try to make that argument if you want

1551
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
I don't know literally been following for

1552
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,463
Also I don't think the early public

1553
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,999
Their first album

1554
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Deeply black nationalist

1555
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,839
Exclaims to believe in

1556
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,119
He is super again

1557
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,703
They explicitly endorse Farrakhan other 1987

1558
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,983
I'm single Bring the Noise

1559
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,799
So I don't know how Alex go pretend to know what they're about

1560
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
Also it's wild

1561
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Griffith Park

1562
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
The group when they got ducted

1563
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,175
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1564
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
Considering he was kicked out the almost legitimately ruined all of their careers

1565
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,111
Really interesting

1566
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,415
The Newsradio episode in this

1567
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,719
Because literally what goes on

1568
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,767
Phil Hartman's character

1569
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:26,655
Grails about the

1570
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,703
I love hip hop

1571
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,983
Alex

1572
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:35,359
Exactly that is real deal

1573
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,967
So I don't know this interview

1574
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,807
It's mostly forgettable

1575
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,855
There's a point when pressed

1576
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,903
Text message and Alex tries

1577
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,439
Presented as someone hacking

1578
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
His phone and listening

1579
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
It's it's Ludacris

1580
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,351
Yeah

1581
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
I think one the best

1582
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
Another get into like mine

1583
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
In control and music

1584
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Cific that I decided I wanted

1585
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,967
America

1586
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119
You gave me a specific I'll look into that

1587
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
Interview I should tell you is just Alex and Professor Griff

1588
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:37,055
It's just that the powers-that-be

1589
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Feminize the black man

1590
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Through Hip Hop

1591
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
His evidence

1592
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,919
Seems to be his belief that Will Smith

1593
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,199
Quincy Jones are gay

1594
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,551
Would you something but is very careful not to explicitly

1595
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
Which is a strategy

1596
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
Chris has been forced to get pretty good at

1597
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Alex Theatre

1598
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Is a kindred spirit

1599
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,279
The rest of it is just generalized mine

1600
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
Controlling Illuminati conspiracy

1601
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Music

1602
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:04,959
Interesting Lee Bruce argument about these are less rooted in his personal experience than they are in

1603
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
Him hearing Alex Jones

1604
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,031
David Icke yell about

1605
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,823
The topic

1606
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,615
To make his experiences mirror there near

1607
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,199
From listening to him speak it's really hard for me to not think that this is Joe

1608
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,503
Just basically Alex interviewing at marginal celebrity

1609
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
But how they used his narrative

1610
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
In their own life

1611
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:27,231
One specific ripto's offer isn't clip is a book called Mind Control the United States written by Steven Jacobs

1612
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
This book

1613
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
And Jacobs

1614
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
All of them

1615
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,863
The argument that the problem with people

1616
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
Bluetooth

1617
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
True

1618
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:39,007
How can we possibly navigate to world around us if everywhere return working

1619
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
Confronted

1620
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,335
That are not true being passed off as truth

1621
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:48,735
I agree with you but I'm almost positive you're the one who's

1622
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,975
Navigate to

1623
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,583
Maybe I should check this book out

1624
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,143
Let me start by putting this very place

1625
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Steven Jacobson is a Luna

1626
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,543
Here's how he argues against evolution

1627
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,360
We're already there

1628
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,248
Man is a blend of indigenous eight forms of the celestial beings who arrived upon the planet

1629
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:24,576
The primate organic body because of the greater dexterity

1630
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,112
Baby hand song

1631
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:30,208
They cohabitate was the first true man

1632
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,816
The inheritance of animal traits spiritual being

1633
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,864
Beastly and their temperament and behavior

1634
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,912
Okay so if I understand correctly

1635
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
Humans didn't evolve

1636
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
But eight

1637
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,568
Matt Venom and the Symbiotes

1638
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,872
Came together and now where some of us are

1639
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
Yeah

1640
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,248
This is full of appeals to occult knowledge

1641
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
Psychic abilities

1642
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,832
Anti-communist

1643
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
Quote

1644
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,976
I received a copy of Gary Allan's none dare call it can

1645
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Conspiracy

1646
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:08,096
I began to study the theory of History

1647
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,144
He cites none dare call it conspiracy

1648
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:14,240
Cleon skousen

1649
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:18,080
I had the politics of the same old antique communist conspiracy bulge

1650
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,384
The source of all of these people's worldviews

1651
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,456
With just a little bit of fun new age horseshit added on top

1652
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,528
I'm listen to this Professor Griff interview in already

1653
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
Helium tank

1654
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Full of

1655
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Bulshit book

1656
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
Any sight of them is authoritative sources

1657
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:39,072
Assume that he's not a guy with a very rigorous fact-checking or critical analysis 14 and play

1658
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,376
But it goes through before he decides to believe so

1659
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,424
Also small point

1660
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,704
He's been over

1661
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
Anti-semite

1662
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
For decades

1663
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:50,336
Controlled the New World Order the Illuminati

1664
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
You have to be

1665
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Complete idiot

1666
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,664
Cannot use available context clues

1667
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,016
There's a very high likelihood that he believes the New World Order is run by Jews

1668
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,576
It might be a productive question for Alex to

1669
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
But I suspect he's worried with the ants

1670
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
He doesn't

1671
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:16,448
If I hate them it's so weird I don't know how to deal with how rich hay Tire

1672
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Experiencing right

1673
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,032
How do you

1674
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,848
Even between

1675
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
Professor Griff

1676
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
The bookie

1677
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Keysight

1678
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
Ends up citing none dare call it conspiracy

1679
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
Skousen a ton

1680
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
And also

1681
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Evolutionism

1682
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
True because

1683
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,952
Professor Griff

1684
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
Define

1685
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
Of course

1686
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
It's very boring real deal

1687
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,328
Call Alex

1688
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
Movies on

1689
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
To another guy

1690
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
He's got another guy

1691
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:32,480
So Alex is next guest is a lawyer who works for young

1692
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:39,648
He's so insane because I'm listening to this episode and Alex says it is next guest as youngevity lawyer

1693
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,816
Close to shock

1694
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
Suppressors legal experts

1695
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,728
I wish it was

1696
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
It's not

1697
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,336
What are more interested in here though is that Alex

1698
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,896
Play there at the end if you get one person

1699
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,016
Jordan

1700
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,296
Wild

1701
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:11,648
New England Journal of Medicine

1702
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:17,280
Listen at least 23,000 people get sent to the emergency room every year for reasons that are directly traced back

1703
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
To take an unregulated dietary

1704
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
I'm glad that

1705
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,424
Team that statistic our government has

1706
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,032
Decided you know what it's time to regulate.

1707
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,336
The author of the study I was a doctor at the

1708
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,640
He was quick to point out that

1709
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,944
Underestimate

1710
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,968
Exaggeration

1711
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
The problem

1712
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,832
What are the main problems is that because of the dietary supplements Health in it

1713
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,648
Education Act of 1994

1714
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,672
From reviewing supplement

1715
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,696
Before they're sold

1716
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,512
They can only intervene sometimes on the supplement is shown

1717
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Dangerous

1718
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,584
This also doesn't

1719
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,144
This applies also to

1720
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
Supplements themselves

1721
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,192
But also to

1722
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,984
That's

1723
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,800
Study found that a significant number of the injuries from supplements

1724
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,408
Children who can easily access the pills because they weren't required to be in childbirth package

1725
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:11,552
2017 Business Insider article reports that the supplement industry Z37 billion-dollar Market

1726
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,112
Would you look at that in that context it starts

1727
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
That's why almost

1728
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
It's almost entirely on regular

1729
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:21,280
Evergreen business

1730
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
These people have a whole lot to lose if

1731
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
The government starts

1732
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
Take the issue seriously

1733
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
The big companies in

1734
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448
Thirty-seven billion dollar in

1735
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,032
I just realized very well-positioned to hire all the attorneys in lobbyist

1736
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,824
They need to make sure their business

1737
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Nastase unregulated they can

1738
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
Continue to face clean

1739
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
Defraud naive

1740
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
And that's why we need

1741
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
Keep money in

1742
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
In politics

1743
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,808
Support

1744
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,088
Decision in the head

1745
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
History of the world

1746
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,184
There's so many problems people taking supple

1747
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,768
If you work some of them can't hurt or kill you ain't

1748
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,840
When people take supplements they often don't tell dr.

1749
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,888
About them when they're asked if they're on any medication

1750
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,424
Some people don't consider them

1751
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,008
Medication

1752
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Unfortunate

1753
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,616
Medications interfere with real medicine

1754
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:13,248
Board for example of antibiotics

1755
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,296
Birth control and Other Drugs

1756
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,088
If doctors don't know you're taking it

1757
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,160
They can prescribe you something for an infection and you'll be

1758
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,720
Sweetly get a notary

1759
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:28,096
When the antibiotics don't work people are then likely to take it as traditional

1760
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,888
It become more drawn to supplement

1761
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,680
As if it's actual medical care

1762
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,984
There were plenty of deaths types of them

1763
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,080
Using plenty more where supplements played a part in the death and it wasn't caught by doctor

1764
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,408
Is disgrace

1765
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,992
And the only reason he would be doing that either because he doesn't know what he's talking

1766
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,552
Or because he's a bottom page jail for assault

1767
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
I would give them both

1768
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,440
That's possible

1769
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
His own

1770
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,584
I'm guessing that now he's kind of disabused

1771
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,376
Himself of the notion that supplements

1772
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Can't f****** you

1773
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:07,520
Exactly

1774
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,568
2013

1775
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:13,920
Probably not over over doing the youngevity supplement

1776
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:21,856
He be convinced by their propaganda two of these are actually good for you and blah blah blah

1777
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
Oceans and boys living in the space words

1778
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,208
Yeah

1779
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,792
So anyway

1780
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
But it's not just

1781
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,096
More

1782
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
Like

1783
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,288
This morning

1784
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,080
So I wanted to get

1785
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:46,944
BMO rd.com

1786
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,464
It is a Genesis Network

1787
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,512
Glidden is also one of these

1788
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:04,096
Spokespeople for youngevity that we talked about the pat

1789
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,912
We have the lawyer on with the doctor

1790
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
From youngevity

1791
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,728
It's called synergy

1792
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,848
This lawyer that Alex is interviewing here on the show's guy by the name of Jonathan

1793
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:21,248
Inform everything I can tell he's basically just made a career out taking on cases that speak to Cripple government regulation of non-medical met

1794
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,600
His claim to fame is that he's beaten the FDA in court more than anybody else

1795
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
That's probably

1796
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,488
In 2010 he won a suit against the FDA that allowed supplement companies

1797
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,256
To make quote

1798
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,560
Qualified Health claims about their products

1799
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608
They can say that their product

1800
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,144
Might help with a certain

1801
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,936
Air condition or reduce the risk of it

1802
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:42,752
But they also have to include a disclaimer that is

1803
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,800
Scientific evidence concerning display

1804
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,872
Based on its review the FDA does not agree

1805
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,200
Since most people jump

1806
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,992
Disclaimers

1807
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,296
I might as well have just been in

1808
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,904
That has made a career

1809
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,720
Helping people get murdered by unregulated Mark

1810
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,536
He's been involved in a number of other similar laws

1811
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,096
Because of it has become something of a hero

1812
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
Format world

1813
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,912
His litigation is genuinely allowed

1814
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,472
But I'm all sorts of wiggle room

1815
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Townspeople totally legal

1816
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:22,176
In most of his lawsuit keyboard is representing an organization called The Alliance for Natural Health USA

1817
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,016
Cases used Peterson

1818
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,552
Sandie Shaw as their defense

1819
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,648
Pearson and Shaw supplement designers who make their money by license

1820
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,928
Thunder product companies

1821
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Who sell them

1822
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
Federal Trade Commission wants to enforce a rule like you can't make Health claims about your product unless you have two clinical trials.

1823
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,984
Eboards law office will petition to Ft

1824
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,312
FTC requirements have a chilling effect

1825
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
Pearson and Shaw

1826
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
Recorded their licensees not

1827
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,176
Communicate to the public on labels and labeling

1828
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
Advertising

1829
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Claim

1830
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
Association

1831
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,040
Between the products they sell

1832
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:03,392
Relief of temporary irregularity 40ft

1833
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,416
DC within the claim

1834
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Deceptive advertising

1835
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
I'm using quote

1836
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,792
Because I was reading from his 2011 petition

1837
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Into the ft's

1838
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
By Framing the argument

1839
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Visalia

1840
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
Free speech

1841
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,704
Speak to the customer

1842
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
By doing it that way

1843
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
The supplement industry that's a win-win

1844
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Situation

1845
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,384
You can agree with their petition and allow them

1846
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,432
Difficulty unsupported claims

1847
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,224
Or the FDIC could disagree

1848
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,296
And then they can go around yelling about the ftcu suppressing their fur

1849
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
Watchlist

1850
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
Lasorda framing

1851
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
Is one of the main Hallmarks of

1852
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
Questionable organization

1853
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,280
Quote nothing more than a ploy to 4

1854
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Persuade legislators to

1855
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,328
The permit the marketing

1856
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,120
Aquatic methods without legal

1857
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,936
Another Hallmark of the use of question

1858
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
Travel organization

1859
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,264
Is it the organization opposes proven health

1860
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
Measures

1861
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Like Florida

1862
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,080
According to source

1863
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:58,432
Watch The Alliance for Natural Health USA was a founding member of the fluoride action

1864
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:06,624
For third strike let's just go ahead and say the Jonathan anymore it is a member of the youngevity

1865
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,768
Which is something

1866
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:16,864
Deserve to be on the youngevity Hall of Fame please do not put me on

1867
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
The posterity list

1868
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
Unfortunately I can't find a list of people in the Hall of Fame

1869
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:26,848
Pictures of

1870
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
They don't want to

1871
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:34,272
Have a list out there

1872
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:42,208
Recalls whenever the FDA

1873
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,072
He's also a lawyer for youngevity but the only cases I could find of him representing them

1874
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,096
A supplement related

1875
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,632
It stopped there for like business

1876
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,680
Thoughts up

1877
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
I don't know

1878
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,592
Please Don't Lie by omission

1879
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,176
What if we just lied a bunch

1880
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,992
But like a little bit differently than those

1881
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
It's most

1882
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,600
Is mostly Alex jumping back and forth from

1883
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,160
Anymore

1884
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
Tennessee

1885
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
Who cares and you should probably buy gold

1886
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,072
All that

1887
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Folks here

1888
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
Kind of makes

1889
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,264
Things a little too overt about what he wants

1890
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Quite frankly Alex

1891
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,872
I couldn't be happier

1892
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:36,480
If the medical system collapses because we

1893
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,552
I mean

1894
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,560
Is going to hell in a handbasket

1895
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,632
Is because we've taken the wrong.

1896
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,424
What do you think there

1897
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,704
Is we

1898
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,520
Western medicine

1899
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:03,616
This medical system that we have

1900
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
To his

1901
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
Supplements and Weirdos

1902
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:11,296
What we should be doing to taking ginkgo biloba

1903
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
Goddamn

1904
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,976
And I we don't need to deregulate we don't need to overhaul

1905
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,536
We need to destroy the medical establishment

1906
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,864
I think if you lead with that people are not going to get on board

1907
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
Usually that's a bad idea

1908
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,704
It's probably a bad opening

1909
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,752
Vale especially when you're trying

1910
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,032
I mean what you're doing is

1911
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
It involves so many aspects of his like Health policy

1912
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,944
So many people

1913
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
It's it's

1914
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
Almost shocking to imagine

1915
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,344
Number

1916
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,648
He actually legally can't call him

1917
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,208
Doctor

1918
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,488
He's a naturopath

1919
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,144
I thought he was an actual doctor

1920
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,680
If he's a naturopath

1921
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:03,008
We got trouble for calling

1922
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,288
A doctor

1923
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,224
I don't want to sit around and just listen

1924
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,016
Listen to these people talk about their

1925
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
Propaganda

1926
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
Industry

1927
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,904
I just want to highlight that this is all just too young

1928
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,712
That's what it all comes down

1929
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,760
He says we're going

1930
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
Andover Drive

1931
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,808
With doctor

1932
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
The whole fourth hour

1933
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:53,952
Is all an adverb

1934
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
Earlier complaining about how he doesn't have the time to get the globalist Playbook

1935
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:13,152
Exactly what was going to happen

1936
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:19,552
Play I do wonder I do wonder if there's craft like that gets it's hard for me to say

1937
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:29,024
3 hours ago and like doing other hour

1938
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,352
It's it's

1939
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,656
I mean there's coordination that needs

1940
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,936
To be involved in Oakland

1941
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:40,288
Schedule

1942
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,128
Dick

1943
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,408
Bulshit

1944
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,856
Could have at least dip your toe into it just read the protocols that yeah

1945
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,184
11

1946
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
12th Street

1947
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,000
In 2013

1948
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
Definitely

1949
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Interesting

1950
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,584
Meet me here but Alex's

1951
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,376
He is so far adrift

1952
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,424
I don't even know what's going on anymore

1953
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,728
And the past

1954
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:16,128
We're talking about racing that we're in a low before

1955
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,200
Call Nora

1956
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,224
I think

1957
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,784
Some people speculated about this

1958
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
Text mother people have this wild that

1959
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:27,648
It becomes deeply entwined with the Boston bombing

1960
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
So we're in this March

1961
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,768
Stretch right

1962
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,072
But it does offer at these great in

1963
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
Alex's

1964
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,912
Former position on Kim Jong-kook

1965
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,704
Nodo Alex interviewing

1966
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,288
Professor Griff like he is one of the most important celebrities in the world

1967
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,664
I would rather you Old-Timers There's an opportunity to learn about Allah

1968
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
Stop along the way

1969
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
That's a good use of our

1970
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Italian Bible

1971
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,064
Absolutely

1972
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Everywhere

1973
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
It is all over the place

1974
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,000
And there are

1975
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Stepping parallels

1976
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,560
Between the present

1977
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,840
And 2013

1978
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
That are

1979
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
I mean it

1980
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
Every time

1981
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,264
The present we're just going back through assert

1982
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,288
Dayton

1983
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,592
And there's a one-to-one comparison

1984
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:25,248
Well I mean

1985
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,552
Some of that is

1986
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
Because

1987
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,368
The same things that are true but

1988
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,416
Between

1989
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
Neit communist

1990
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
Extremist

1991
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,536
In the early to mid 60s

1992
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,376
Victor similarities are there and they haven't changed

1993
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,400
To the present day

1994
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,216
Of course just because a lot of these people using things like

1995
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,800
Cultural Marxism replacement fears

1996
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,104
A lot of it is using the same operating

1997
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,664
Right-wing extremist

1998
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
Have

1999
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
Baby communism

2000
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
And

2001
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,368
The world that the people who were primarily motivated by

2002
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,392
That paradigm

2003
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,184
Exist throughout a ton of

2004
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
Extremism

2005
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:10,048
Change

2006
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Shocking because

2007
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,216
It's also not that surprising because

2008
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,496
What is a piece of

2009
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,520
The continuum

2010
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
Is right wing

2011
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,312
Terrorism

2012
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,592
Stochastic Lorax

2013
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,128
And I think

2014
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
You just have to deal with that

2015
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,504
Why would they stop doing

2016
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Exact same

2017
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
Propaganda

2018
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Text if they are

2019
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
Continuing to work

2020
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,672
Yeah course there are parallels

2021
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
Between

2022
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,304
I mean the beginning of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2023
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,328
So well that they

2024
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
Rolling with it

2025
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,912
And we still haven't figured out a fix for it

2026
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,728
For this b*******

2027
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,824
It stopped

2028
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,176
I think if we don't figure it out

2029
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,968
There will be

2030
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:09,696
It is

2031
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
Something that

2032
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,768
It will continue to be a problem

2033
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,536
Until

2034
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:19,424
We figure it out. There's a lot we need to figure out

2035
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,472
What is behind all of this

2036
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,776
That's been going on

2037
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,616
The present episode

2038
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,736
Ray of sunshine

2039
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:39,136
Is it because every question that I was thinking of

2040
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Fair enough

2041
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,488
Natural reaction

2042
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
To have right now

2043
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
Island

2044
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,304
I hope everyone is

2045
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,120
All right be well

2046
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,680
Website

2047
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:58,080
It's knowledge freight.com

2048
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,384
We are weary if you want to download the

01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
Go to I-10

2050

You could also leave a review there you could if you have a
