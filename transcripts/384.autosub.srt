1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Hey everybody

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,120
Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
How old was your first

8
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Experience with

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
We being legal in Illinois

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
We became illegal on the 1st

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Of January and that evening I got a text from a friend and

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
Remember who it was it was Jordan

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
Sent me a text that he wanted to go and down

14
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,880
The Dispensary on the 2nd of January

15
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
And I thought hey I don't smoke weed why not

16
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Which is a stupid decision

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
No not really so down there and

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Enzo's

19
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
Springtime is a bit of a long line

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Professional processor

21
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
Pretty smooth

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Considering it was the second

23
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
Today they were in operation

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
I got a couple of gummies and

25
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Seeing if it helps with sleep how is it going for you so far the results are inconclusive

26
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Like it's helping a little bit but

27
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
I'm not entirely sure if that's

28
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
Sibo Factor whatever but

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
It's interesting

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Yeah I'm driving my my ability to metabolize things is a little bit rough because they said

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Said that the average dose for a the gummies would like a half of one that's so the people at the place

32
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
I-82 and it barely

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Registered

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Like it

35
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
It was bad you may have a problem that might be on my end not there

36
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
Almost no interest in using any of this

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,000
Hyper say so I don't really even care about your trouble.

38
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
You're inside

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Super 8

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
We'll see what happens

41
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
It was surprising

42
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,832
I've never waited 4 hours for

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
That long

44
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
And they allowed

45
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
You like it you had a really interesting

46
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
Sting set up where you would sign in

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And then they were text

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Text you when you were it was ready for

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,656
Come to be light in that was brilliant

50
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
And I wandered around

51
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Andersonville a

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
I wasn't I wasn't like you standing there waiting

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
Which would have been a deal-breaker

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,040
I was already ready to leave anyways

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah so anyway I don't know I don't know about that but I do know a lot about Alex

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Today we have an episode

57
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm not really positive that I am wanting to do at a while to get out of the present day

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,592
Yeah well I mean me to keep her many different I keep having like a

59
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,688
Like a while we've done a bunch of presents episodes

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
Time to go do something else and then something will happen in the world

61
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Like Alex's depositional happen

62
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
You know it'll come out that he lost $100,000 in

63
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
Confused to the court

64
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Trump goes ahead

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
Assassinate

66
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
Not cover the outside of the public

67
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,823
I'm not sitting here complaining

68
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
To be in the presentation

69
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,759
It is a slug a little bit I think it probably is for the listeners to I apologize about that

70
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,599
As soon as we have a chance to do an episode that is not the present day I promise you

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
We will do WhatsApp

72
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Development

73
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Situations

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
Positions on them

75
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Are interesting to note generally speaking when the when historians will look back and say this was where we

76
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,847
Highly doubt that

77
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,687
Yes

78
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711

79
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247

Yes thank you very much

97

To our website

98
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Extremely

99
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,623
So today is episode they were going over his January 3rd 2020

100
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
Hey

101
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,655
It's Friday of last week the day after Trump

102
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Ordered the strike

103
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Dua LIPA

104
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Steak-Out sulaimani

105
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,639
Get into some of that a little bit before there's not a complex dropped

106
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Today Show

107
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
I'm Alex Jones at this year's 2020 he's ripping off Barbara Walters

108
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
Do that everyday

109
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
What a dick

110
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
Acclaim for weekend Today show I want to give a little bit of a

111
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Disclaimer

112
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
I'm not an expert in geopolitics

113
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
I can really only go on the information that's available and I can

114
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,799
Can find witches oftentimes limited particularly in the case of evolving and ongoing

115
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Situation

116
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,919
Some potentially major events unfolded over the course of the last weekend

117
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Things will come up on this episode

118
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
I want

119
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Rest I'm going to

120
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
Try my best to stay away from over

121
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Analyzing things

122
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Too much

123
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
Since I will probably be a little bit irresponsible of someone like me to do

124
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
There are many other great places where they kind of work

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,839
Is being done by far more competent hands and I would encourage people to rely although sources

126
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
For more nuanced

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Discussion

128
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
The geopolitical C

129
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
I don't know what Iran is going to do to respond

130
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
And I don't want to stay

131
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
If you're off track

132
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
If you and I playing guessing games it's not productive

133
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Yeah

134
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
That being said I want to offer two very strong positions that I hold

135
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
And it'll probably best to acknowledge up top

136
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Before we get into anything

137
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Whenever I say that you're welcome to speak your piece

138
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Pieces well Jordan position

139
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Alright the first is that I'm absolutely

140
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
Categorically opposed to a war with Iraq

141
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,887
And I'm equally opposed to the actions that makes such a war more likely

142
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
I understand that many would see the invasion of the US Embassy

143
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Being a rock is ground to a response

144
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
And I understand that position where that's coming from

145
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
But I think

146
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
This level of response seems way out of

147
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Proportion and Rec

148
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Second from everything I've read on the subject

149
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,063
Trump crosses very serious line by killing soleimani

150
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
In the to the money was an official of the Irani and

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
This is an official of a sovereign government who Trump has openly admitted

152
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
You ordered the assassination of

153
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Which is a really f***** up

154
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,679
I have some discomfort with the idea of drone Warfare generally speaking but when it's being used

155
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Commit political assassinations on government

156
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Figures Within

157
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
Countries that we are not at war with is a very serious matter

158
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
In an article in the Atlantic owner Hathaway

159
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
Professor of international law at Yale Law School

160
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,087
Applying that the strike to kill soleimani was a breach not only of our constitution

161
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
But also international law

162
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
Because Trump did not inform Congress nor did he approach the UN Security Council before make

163
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Decision

164
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
These problems could be resolved

165
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
If the attack was done to stop an imminent

166
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is claimed

167
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
But no one is produced any proof.

168
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Support that assertion

169
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
It's my feeling that

170
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,151
Leaving aside how bad a guy soleimani might have been or may have been probably was

171
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
What Trump did was wrong and profoundly dangerous

172
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,295
Given all the information I have at my disposal I don't see

173
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Any gray area there

174
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
And Trump's actions sense

175
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
The Killing have only made me feel

176
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
Concerned even more so

177
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,559
It's probably debatable if the assassination count as an act of provocation

178
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
That would justify a Ron

179
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Declare war

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
But what's not debatable is that after all of that

181
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
Trump took to Twitter and literally threatened to

182
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Commit war cry

183
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
He said quote

184
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
Let this serve as a warning that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we've targeted 52 Irani and site

185
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
Representing the 52 American American hostages taken by a Ron many years ago

186
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,415
Summit a very high level and importance to Ron and the Irani and culture

187
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
And those targets and around itself will be hit very fast and very hard

188
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
The US wants no more threat

189
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Brett's

190
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
The part about a roni and culture being targeted is a massive red flag

191
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Targeting cultural sites as University

192
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Considered a war crime and not for nothing.

193
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
People you generally

194
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Killing by attacking

195
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Cultural sites

196
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Are noncombatants

197
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
So the very idea that a president would say something like this

198
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Is absolutely unacceptable territory for us to be in

199
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
The way Trump is behaving is villain

200
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
This is authoritarian level s*** and I just don't even know what to say

201
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
There's obviously more to the story than we know right now

202
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
And putting singular blame on Trump I think would be foolish

203
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
He's ultimately responsible for the decision

204
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
But I think you'll be naive to think it was

205
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
The decision was made in a vac

206
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Obviously advisor

207
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
They're surrounded people court hearing him and direct

208
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Score for me to speculate on the

209
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
The precise precise aspect of that

210
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
I think at this point would be

211
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
JustBats regulator

212
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,343
One thing that strikes me is that I feel like Alex and I should be on the same page on this

213
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
The fact the trumpet

214
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
Kill a government official from a state were not at war with

215
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Without notifying Congress

216
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
To be everything Alex is against in an executive

217
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Alex is an anti-war guy release pretends to be

218
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Food should be pretty clear as a case of

219
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
Trump stepping way outside the bounds of acceptable action

220
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
And doing things that tend to make war more likely not less

221
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
This should be a slam dunk for Alex's way to leave Trump

222
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
But I think we all know how

223
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
So these are sort of the position

224
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
That I'm coming in with and I don't want to necessarily litigate a lot of the

225
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Like

226
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
But what about

227
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Right now

228
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
The angles of it

229
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
I think

230
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Leaving everything aside

231
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
This is not an acceptable action now and then the way Trump has behaved afterwards has made the action itself even were

232
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
And so I

233
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
That's sort of the position I'm coming

234
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
I I suppose the only thing that I can say now that makes me

235
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Field I guess

236
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Istick

237
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Intruded my prince

238
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Supposes that

239
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,767
W Obama and Trump should all be prosecuted for work

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
Like I guess I guess there's no other way to make

241
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Extensive list sure

242
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
You know

243
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,239
Like it's if we hadn't done anything if we did something to process

244
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Cqww for his war crimes

245
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Maybe we would

246
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Maybe and we didn't do anything

247
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
And we just allowed it to.

248
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Deteriorate so

249
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Our government should

250
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Most of them being tail

251
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
I guess that's

252
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Yeah we've had

253
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
How many

254
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
My life has been spent at War

255
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,023
You know how many how many opportunities have we had two to do this and

256
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
The extent to which we've

257
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Given the executive branch

258
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Carte blanche

259
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,959
Has led obviously to a

260
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
Situation where the Mad King can do whatever you want

261
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
This is a this is the endpoint

262
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Of

263
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
What happened

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Yes it's The Logical conclusion of that

265
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
And like I said I don't want

266
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
To overanalyze stuff because I'm not

267
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm not equipped

268
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm not I am not

269
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
I would be putting on a

270
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
I'll be back Sunday

271
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Some sort of capabilities

272
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
Without getting too deep into anything

273
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,775
Until things come up along the way I do want to say that this episode

274
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
The total mass

275
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
But honestly only half of the situation

276
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
That makes it a mess is because of what's going on with her on

277
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
As you might expect on a day like this of international intrigue

278
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Alex and Steve pieczenik on to get his expert

279
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
And you not think

280
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
And that interview deteriorates into territory that even

281
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Shocked meme

282
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
What you're saying a lot considering

283
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
These recent appearances on the show or he said that representative

284
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Permit to go away

285
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Due process is stupid

286
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
Yeah but he was involved in the death of Utah crabbing

287
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
That one was a little bit of time slot for Steve to shock me

288
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
Suffice it to say somehow he managed

289
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
To do I'm surprised

290
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
He's not claiming any involvement in the

291
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,343
Okay cuz I really think he might not in the present

292
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Although he does

293
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Say that

294
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Repeatedly

295
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
That he is he knew the Ayatollah

296
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Before

297
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Okay I got

298
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,007
And they said I feel like a maniac said that his son was stupid

299
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
Okay alright

300
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
It's an interesting

301
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
That's that's f******

302
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Bonkers

303
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Dad said when he gets in about the 2nd hour

304
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
For now Alex starts the

305
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Show off in a very weird way

306
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Because this is Giant

307
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
News breaking

308
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
And having conversations

309
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
About

310
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Shades of 2,000

311
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
3 people having

312
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Conversations about what

313
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,215
Does this mean are there like this legally justifiable in anyway

314
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
So I'm going to go with

315
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
He's going to talk about the movie Oblivion

316
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
No

317
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Now this is what

318
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
13 East forgotten about the way to go if you don't want to talk about this

319
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
Forgotten that that's a movie and now things

320
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
This is a white paper

321
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
Do you start out by bragging about how he's getting a lot of traffic

322
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
The Infowars servers are laboring

323
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
Record traffic As the World Turns in

324
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
Myself and my guests are going to break down and say and what colors

325
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Broadcast

326
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
You're going to say about the historic

327
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
Credibly bold move

328
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
That we witnessed yesterday

329
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
So Alex starts out on a pretty

330
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,887
Like Hey we're getting tons of point is that we're getting record traffic with first of all

331
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Maybe a

332
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Recent record of something

333
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Record traffic

334
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,335
Pick from your yeah yeah

335
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
But it is a

336
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
A selfie

337
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Aggrandize

338
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Using opening

339
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,039
Hey yes there is a lot going on in the world

340
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,439
When big things happen in the world everyone wants to know what I'm saying

341
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
I think it is

342
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
On the other hand I think

343
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,887
The last time Trump bombed somebody Alex got really drunk

344
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,935
Cried on air so I think

345
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
People are thinking like call God

346
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,591
Yeah yeah yeah it is a certain amount of

347
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Training the people have gone under the

348
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,039
Crazy's going to have to be surprised if he did get a lot of eyes toon again to be like what

349
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Going to do

350
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Is he going to finally break with Trump over this he's already the last time he said he crammed Isis up

351
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,071
A dirty a*******

352
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
You got to take it up

353
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Not you

354
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
I would believe he's getting increase traffic

355
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,359
It's not people who are like I need to know what he's going to say

356
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
I think that's what's going on but

357
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
It seems to show where his priorities are released where his head is

358
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Yeah as

359
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
So Alex said you heard him say that this was a bold

360
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
Trump drone attacking sulemani

361
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
And

362
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
You know that

363
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Continues he keeps

364
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Calling it Bowl

365
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
At the beginning of the show he's trying to walk a line here where is

366
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
He's not

367
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Into donating a right

368
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
But it is a bulge

369
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
Decisive move by the

370
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
The sense that I get from listening to this and it doesn't change

371
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Really throughout the

372
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
The entire time is it

373
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
In favor of this

374
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
But doesn't want to be in favor of

375
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,903
Doesn't want to be like overly like you're right but is

376
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
Pretty in favor and I think

377
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Wants to go to war with Iraq

378
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
He also doesn't want to say he wants to go to war with Iran

379
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Defensive

380
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
Quite frankly he sounds a lot like a lot of the people I remember Becky

381
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
Beginning of the Rocks sounds very similar

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
Which is weird lot of those folks are coming back up

383
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
What I'm showing backup makes total sense

384
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Alex Jones

385
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,319
Becoming one of them is a transformations

386
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
But anyway

387
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Here's how Alex or two starts this

388
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
If you eat encourages of Siri

389
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Febrile response

390
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,399
Really pull back and be cerebral about this and I'm trying to that myself

391
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:52,287
Also really quick this sound is terrible

392
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Do we need to stop now is atrocious

393
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,919
Just I don't I don't know what it I don't know what the problem is the audio is

394
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
The disaster

395
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
How much for myself

396
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,903
Look geopolitically what's happening around the world and what message President Trump

397
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
North Korea

398
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,839
Obama and Hillary and John Kerry that I've been working with Iran

399
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Against

400
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
President Trump and Congress

401
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Against the law

402
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
The fact that they been encouraging Iran to

403
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Attack ships

404
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,711
Engage in massive military activity across the Middle East

405
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,807
So I don't I don't know if people are actually doing that

406
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Yeah

407
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
Don't don't you don't do that well it's only because Obama actually made this all so I can

408
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,751
The second thing is like this is a message to everyone

409
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
Message to

410
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah yeah yeah

411
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
Alex starts talking about a Ron

412
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,135
He starts talking about the country is in some pretty glowing terms but also at the same time

413
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
You know how licking pro-wrestling

414
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
A really good

415
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Opponent

416
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
We'll talk about how great you are if you fighting

417
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,959
Right because they want to beat someone that they have built up

418
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
You're like a person you're in a few to get a piece of s*** you

419
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,383
You suck now. Either of you no matter what ends up happening

420
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
It's the Travelling Ronin looking for the greatest swordsman in the land in order to defeat him and test his true powers

421
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
Someone over

422
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
And that's kind of how I feel a little bit about

423
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Alex

424
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
At the way he talks about a wrong

425
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
This episode is very much like

426
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Building them up

427
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
But also like

428
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
There are worthy adversary

429
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
Won't it be glorious when we defeat

430
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
And the Iranians are where the word

431
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Aryan come from

432
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
Models of the Aryan plan

433
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,223
Believe for 3000 years they have a right to rule the Earth

434
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
Iranian people are very smart

435
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
They founded what is Modern India today

436
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,232
Pakistan they invented shafts much of language astronomy

437
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
And a mixture of that was

438
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
Islam is a good case of cancer

439
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Anyway you slice it

440
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
So we already had one guy last century

441
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
Going to take over the planet

442
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,664
We we do have that going on again I'm not saying I want to have war with Iran

443
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Either the devil

444
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
That the

445
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
Hezbollah militia

446
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
Islam

447
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Dinner working with globalist deep state

448
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Trump and America

449
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
That's not being discussed the news why this happen

450
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
Well that's cuz this is convoluted not is anything that he just said true there is one little colonel

451
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Send Ronnie and culture cuz I'm pretty sure they didn't invent chess

452
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
Exist

453
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
As a name for one of the 16 Nations mentioned in the zoroastrian text

454
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
The avesta

455
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
It denotes the Central Asian group that was known for being good and lawful people

456
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,584
It's not a racial or ethnic designation it's more of a cultural descriptor in the tax

457
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
And the oldest known copy of that dates back to about 2

458
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
224 2651

459
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Who's a really easy

460
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
I text you

461
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Absolutely not Beacon

462
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Confused with the racialized

463
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,456
Concept of area that's associated with Hitler because they're

464
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Completely separate ID

465
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
The notion of an Aryan race didn't come into being until like the midday

466
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
1800

467
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
It was largely uses

468
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Vehicle to Ark

469
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
For Caucasian Supremacy

470
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
Referencing back

471
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
2

472
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Prince's India Vesta

473
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
That was one of the pillars

474
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Evidence that

475
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
It was used to bolster the

476
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Caucasian

477
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
Aryan race

478
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Bulshit

479
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
Obviously Hitler had a plan that involved Aryans and racial Purity but I'm not entirely sure there was ever such a thing as an official

480
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Plan called

481
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
The area

482
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
10 plan

483
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
I can find

484
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
No references really

485
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
The Arium plan in any official writing

486
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
Things are serious places

487
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
The only place I can

488
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Find where the term comes up is

489
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Make some Neo-Nazi blogs

490
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
A book called the holy book of Adolf Hitler

491
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
For some context that book was written in 1950

492
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
E2 by James Laurent Battersby

493
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Who was a British fascist

494
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Who believed the Hitler was Christ

495
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
One wonders if that's one of these gift

496
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
2000 books about World War

497
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
What's claims he's red man you got to be you got to be bones if you think Hitler's is the next Messiah

498
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
Call Dan

499
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
A lot of the stuff Alex bring something like

500
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,512
Complete muddying of historical Concepts in linguistics that I really have the page

501
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
To address

502
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
Cuz there's a larger point

503
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Worth mentioning

504
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:09,216
Alex is literally saying that last century we had a guy who called himself an Aryan who wanted to rule the world

505
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
That's happening again

506
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
He says that he doesn't want war

507
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,360
Everything you saying justifies war is being the only

508
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Only possible outcome

509
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
These are the words of a warmonger

510
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
Who's also too much of a coward to be pro-war when

511
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Mayfield's

512
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,088
That's his position that's it that's the sense that I get its

513
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,208
If you're if you're saying that there

514
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
I like that's just

515
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Setting them up as the next Hitler

516
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
You didn't even know that they were going to be the next Hitler yesterday and today all the sudden you're bringing out the zoroastrian and

517
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
Mistletoe prove that we need to bomb

518
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
The mask

519
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,384
So Alex every single time there's something major in the world

520
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
It's a false flag

521
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
This one is probably not a false

522
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
This one

523
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Is absolutely not a fault

524
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Clear

525
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
This is not a false flag this is not a staged event

526
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,096
Put a white person did it

527
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
F*** you

528
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:19,616
So getting that makes it seem pretty positive strong message from the president's not at fault

529
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Flag

530
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Shiite militias have been killing all over them

531
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
It seems like he's

532
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,112
Justifying the act more than he is analyzing it any meaning for what

533
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
Like I really don't like the same like

534
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Propaganda push in 2000

535
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Three I'm just feeling that

536
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
From so many side

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
I-it's

538
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
It's just so creeping

539
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Insidious

540
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
I hate it is frustrating

541
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
But if it makes you feel any better

542
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
You should take some comfort in knowing that Alex

543
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Isn't taking a side

544
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
True

545
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Very much

546
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
He's not taking the side he's at work

547
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
Just reviewing all the ankle

548
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
I am not going to come on this show

549
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
And

550
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Choose a side

551
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,328
Crime against the strike

552
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
And I'm not doing that to be lukewarm.

553
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Take a side

554
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,288
I'm doing that because I want to look at this

555
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Perspective

556
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,384
Government

557
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,064
And the individuals running our government and talk about the different players that are involved

558
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
And what has brought us to this point

559
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Then

560
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,768
At the bottom of the hour I am going to give you my personal you

561
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
I think about this situation and where I think it's headed

562
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
What my

563
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Richard Menendez

564
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Spiritual gut-level

565
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
B is

566
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
So he's not going to take a side with the bottom of the H going to take a side

567
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Sure

568
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Sure I like

569
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
Hey I know what is what I'm hoping for

570
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
I'm hoping for

571
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
One-on-one combat

572
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Trump versus Khomeini

573
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
We take it that everybody's taken

574
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Right

575
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Nah

576
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Winner-take-all.

577
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
We we become Iran if they've Khomeini beats up truck we become Iran Alex would love that because he thinks

578
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,592
I got to chastise for that because I

579
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
I am

580
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Yeah

581
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
I think that

582
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
He doesn't

583
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
Need to say that I'm a

584
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm not going to get on the show and take a side cuz you've already taken

585
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Yeah

586
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,696
You already Empire

587
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
All you can do is

588
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Break that's all you can do

589
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
You can either just

590
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
Do what you're going to do whatever mealy-mouthed nonsense

591
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
This is

592
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,960
Is just a continuation of the side you're already on the only way you can

593
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,776
Can say anything meaningful as be like this is it

594
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Yeah and he's never going

595
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
I don't never but he's certainly not doing it on this

596
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
Surprise

597
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
You say you're not taking aside

598
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
You're still then giving tacit

599
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Permission

600
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
For them to do that

601
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,928
That you know either you are against it or you are passively

602
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Adore active

603
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
So Alex begins his sort of analysis

604
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
About the situation with

605
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
Ron and Ann in Iraq by talking about

606
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Syria

607
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
Emotion

608
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Included

609
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,224
I want to analyze the facts here

610
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:43,648
We know that there have been six different chemical attacks that have all been confirmed

611
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
3-stage

612
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
5 years

613
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
Before

614
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
The office I'd say several

615
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,448
The Isis and Al-Qaeda operatives would fire the chemical weapon

616
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
Videos wanting to get

617
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Rockstars

618
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
The Assyrians

619
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,296
We would come on Aaron say that is not the case that is a stage chemical attack

620
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
And it's all been confirmed

621
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
So when I was just a chemical weapon

622
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,256
The taxis not talking about a Ron this is just about Syria

623
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,096
Endlessly complicated topic

624
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Disingenuous fired

625
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
Present myself as an expert on the topic but I can

626
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Tell you that I've read up a bit on the relevant literature

627
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Anythink

628
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
These attacks were faked

629
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Defensive

630
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,456
Alex believes that the rebels in Syria attack themselves with chemical weapons in order to sway World opinion

631
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
It against the Assad regime

632
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
Impromptu us attacks on Assad

633
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,136
This is not based on any evidence really it's just kind of Alex

634
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Got feeling in the gut feeling

635
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
How much is gas

636
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
It's kind of the same thing as when I was

637
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
It's predicted that the glow stick

638
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Because that's what he would do if you were there

639
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,448
He's discussing these artists for in Conflict so little of it is based on reality

640
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,336
And so much of the analysis seems to boil down to what Alex would probably do if you was in the rebels place

641
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
Is desired outcome

642
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,968
So everyone must be similarly inclined absolutely

643
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Kind of Howard

644
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
The real giveaway that Alex is talking s*** here

645
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,136
Is it he says that the UN has had to admit that these chemical weapons

646
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Is that extra staged

647
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
That's a bald-faced

648
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Reply

649
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,096
The only sliver of truth to it is that Russia has consistently vetoed measures in the UN Security Council

650
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Investigate the use of chemical weapons

651
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Syria

652
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Which seems weird

653
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
All Alex's doing is repeating Rush

654
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Russian government

655
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,872
Going going back to at least 2013 Russia was arguing that the chemical attacks

656
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Being staged

657
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Sway public

658
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Opinion against

659
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,016
Facade which makes sense given the he's a major Ally there's in the region

660
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,368
All credible investigations done by groups like The Human Rights Council in the organization

661
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
The prohibition of chemical weapons

662
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Do not support Alex

663
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
And Russia's conclusion

664
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Anyone

665
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,328
Has not had to come out and admit because Alex was so bold

666
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Report

667
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
The truth I'm pretty sure that would have been much bigger

668
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
News

669
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,008
If that would have been a real big news dad remember that twin

670
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
24-hours Michael actually great dude

671
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Yeah no not happened

672
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
Strange but that's the perception

673
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
To have

674
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,368
I will get back to this a little bit later cuz it comes back up

675
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,184
Just got a tiny bit more.

676
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Detailed but

677
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Suffice it to say I just find that

678
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
That's Tuff

679
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
Yeah when these guys

680
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Talk

681
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
You can see how much

682
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Damage

683
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
Is really possible when Alex starts talking about 4 in

684
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Because

685
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
You know when you get

686
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Sure you can

687
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,664
F****** our ability to get Medicare for all

688
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
And that's going to ruin

689
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
A lot of people a lot of

690
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
People's lives but when he starts saying nonsense about foreign policy

691
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
This how we get into a f****** War

692
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Where hundreds of thousands

693
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
The people die

694
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
I've been violently

695
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
No fakes

696
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
Actually I think he's irrelevant enough

697
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Probably isn't having a

698
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:10,752
Any like actual impact on decisions that are made but there is

699
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824
You know it would be Hazard considerable audience

700
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Deleting them as a block

701
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,456
Block as an electorate you know of some sort of voting

702
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
That didn't able

703
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
Facilitate

704
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Negative

705
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,208
No information or on no factual information

706
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Yeah exact

707
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,840
And that's that's not good justo is opinion

708
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,704
Admitted it must know but he feels like

709
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Alex believe that

710
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
The message Trump is sending

711
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
And this whole thing

712
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Is about

713
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
China is the real issue

714
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,016
Middle-east isn't even an issue we don't even give a s*** about them anymore

715
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,904
Yeah there's if there's a kernel of it okay

716
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
Pragmatically saying we're not going to do this in the Middle East is not an issue where are the energy independently

717
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
You asked

718
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,216
China they're the real threat and the globalist want to divert us and our military in our blood

719
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Trap

720
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,104
I don't touch it on this in the past but Alex is parroting a disingenuous Trump talk

721
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
I'm going to hear that

722
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
Is unacceptable to like Stan

723
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,576
He's trying to present the idea that Trump is above The Fray because now the US Energy Independence

724
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Sorry about the Middle East

725
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
Kind of a f*****-up notion on a

726
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
Let's face and it does seem to imply that our only interest

727
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
Booby yeah that

728
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
If I'm

729
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
Yeah something that Trump himself

730
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
But the reality here is that we're not energy

731
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Dependent person

732
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
Alex is confusing that with our Trend towards becoming a netex

733
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Exporter of oil

734
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
The same thing

735
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
According to foreign policy we still imported

736
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,992
Proximately a million barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia in

737
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
2018

738
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,648
The generally agreed-upon definition of energy Independence is that we would be producing more energy than we

739
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
We consume

740
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,744
And during couple months of last year that was something we achieve

741
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
But this isn't the Trump thing though

742
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,376
It's been a long trended process in the process of

743
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,704
The steady rise in energy production and relative stability and energy

744
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Consumption

745
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Going all the way back

746
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Text through Obama's entire presidency

747
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
I don't believe that Alex is using the term energy dependence

748
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Independent in that

749
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Contacts though

750
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
It feels more like you saying that we don't

751
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
Import anything we can just create all our energy ourselves

752
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Which is defended

753
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Yeah it does sound like

754
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
He saying if

755
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,256
If United States were suddenly cut off in the entire world

756
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
That is

757
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
The image that he's hoping to

758
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
The present that's not true

759
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Like weed

760
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,192
A lot of the energy that we produce so in order to meet our

761
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,264
Assumption needs we still bringing a ton of foreign energy

762
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
LG products

763
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Why was that

764
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,736
So well that's why when you see the Strait of Hormuz taken down 45 hours a hundred million dollars

765
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
And all that so you know that everything is just

766
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,856
Disrupted right massively anyway

767
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Anybody for a net exporter of oil

768
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
It doesn't mean that

769
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
We're immune

770
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,536
The fluctuation

771
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
All this stuff is interconnected in ways that Alex is a sort of poo poo in

772
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
It's not a good

773
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Perspective

774
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
I mean again that comes back to this type of

775
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,616
It's like if if you are incapable of understanding the new one

776
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Just like you know

777
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:35,552
Not neither you nor I are going to claim to have good policy-making ideas or experience for for Impala

778
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,856
Countries that we have no

779
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
But somehow this dude will f******

780
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Do you say he knows what's going

781
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Simple

782
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
If ya simple like

783
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,376
Will you hit him there and then that. That's done he's cracked this

784
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
But he can't explain

785
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
Unless he had 20 pages

786
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
The paper that he could give you a

787
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Brief sketch of it

788
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
But you knows it all is that

789
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
And that's why the input

790
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
Create such easy output

791
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,040
Of course it's all very simple in his head

792
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
So much that

793
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Use

794
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:14,208
Just it it willfully ignoring or unaware of whatever it is it stupid

795
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Anyway we're only at this

796
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Is red right now with Iran

797
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
Because he's

798
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Double-dealing globalist

799
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:27,008
I really don't feel like that's true I think the people who got us here were very straightforward

800
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
Directed their desire to start a war

801
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Double-dealing level

802
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
So why we got to this point

803
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Because

804
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,016
The Deep state bureaucracy CFR

805
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
The Bilderberg level is leftist arm of it

806
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Neocon

807
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
Everyone but the guy who ordered it with Iran

808
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Barack Obama

809
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Hillary Clinton

810
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
The only Hill the general McMaster time

811
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
They have been working

812
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
In Shadow diplomacy

813
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
Derail everything the Trump trying to do to bring real daytime

814
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Stalemate

815
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
Fire

816
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,808
Africa and the Middle East and in the global strategy

817
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,648
Flooding turkey

818
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Stabilization

819
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Backflip is a prime example of Alex saying nothing

820
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
He's accusing vague factions like

821
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,472
The quote Bilderberg globalist a leftist arm of the CFR with a run for

822
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,776
Stabilization what did he say what does that mean

823
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
What the f*** other than salad is Bilderberg globalist electus arm of the CFR

824
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,552
Things to work with neocon mean salad it's a very very

825
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
Specific group of people

826
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,648
So dumb maybe three or four people fit that

827
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,256
Right when you get that many qualifiers and do it because

828
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,864
Inclusive it everybody everybody everybody

829
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Modify

830
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Globalist

831
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,240
Even Beyond

832
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Concern

833
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
What is a Pakistan rating about

834
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
If you talkin about

835
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,712
What are Obama Hillary Fiona Hill and the general

836
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Master types do it

837
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
I want to sing the working

838
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,088
Publicly in Shadow diplomacy but what does that mean

839
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
It can mean whatever you needed to mean dear listener whatever you think it is

840
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
Iran nuclear deal that's talking about

841
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
It's all

842
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
It's all just him throwing it a bunch of words to give you the idea that it's

843
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Anybody

844
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Sport.ro

845
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
It is not his fault

846
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Nothing is his fault that's a big piece of it but

847
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
I think the larger

848
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
The thing is that

849
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Vagueness is a weapon for someone smart alec

850
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
You can just rattle off a list of his enemies name

851
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,320
Make some meaninglessly vague accusations about things they're doing

852
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Whatever

853
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,952
The hot-button topic of the day is going to move along acting like he knows everything and he said something

854
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
But you haven't said s***

855
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
ISM doesn't mean anything

856
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Nope

857
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Anyway I wish you'd be more specific

858
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
Feel like it does

859
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
So did the big is it

860
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
What Trump is doing

861
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
Is that he's letting these

862
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Government

863
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,664
Like North Korea

864
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Is the carrot or the stick

865
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
You can okay

866
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Isleta

867
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Tyranno just like

868
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Situation

869
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
Maria's at the stick

870
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,376
If you stop all this the sanctions will go away and will work with you if you keep escalating and working with the Deep state

871
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,448
The international global system for the icons

872
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,264
Baris America into sabotage

873
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,104
And to bankrupt our military and our country we are going to

874
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,432
When you're militarily expanding and

875
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,320
When you proportionately start attacking us we proportionately attacking you it's going to ask you later until we

876
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Bunker-buster bombs

877
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,648
Kill the mulas

878
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
Anti Ron

879
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
That's something

880
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Please

881
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
Individuals understand

882
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
This Is War enabling nonce

883
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Incense

884
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,544
Like for one thing Alex is saying that these countries are working with his globalist enemies so Trump is putting sanctions on that week

885
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
Play play ball

886
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,248
Seems like a pretty Far Cry from the sort of Auntie intervention is posturing Alex used to engage in

887
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
A far cry from his

888
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,624
Constant reasonably Fair attacks on the United States government

889
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,720
Were there at the end over the sanctions are applied to a rock that killed so many Sevilla

890
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
Absolutely

891
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,072
The f****** time and just seems very

892
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Not in line with that

893
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,936
As for North Korea I don't see how that's a good analog

894
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,288
If you look at the real world Trump's meeting with Kim Jeong Hoon of not really done

895
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Anyting

896
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,408
There's no positive outcome in it for the United States and only positives for North Korea

897
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
Just the other day on January 1st

898
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,552
NPR reported on a speech carried by the Korean Central news agency

899
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Or Kim Jeong Hoon had announced that he quote

900
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
No longer feels Bound by a selfie

901
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
Imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range

902
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Missile testing

903
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
The Story Goes On to say quote

904
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:10,400
Kcna quoted him as saying there was no reason to remain committed to his moratorium because the US

905
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Not reciprocated

906
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,544
But it continued to hold joint military drills with the set with South Korea and send advance

907
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Best weapons to the South

908
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,920
In situations like this with Trump is doing is not saying I hate

909
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
The character the stack

910
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
What are you doing is providing

911
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Pretext

912
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Which Rogue actors

913
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Used to just

914
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
5 horrible s***

915
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,672
Trump pulled out of Iran nuclear deal unilaterally and imposed harsh sanctions on them

916
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,232
What according to all experts on the matter of Ron was

917
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
Complying with the deal

918
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Trump made some kind of it

919
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
Beetle with Kim Jeong Hoon which Beatles are

920
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Has not been honored

921
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,704
Both of these are examples of really shity for in relation

922
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Witch makeup

923
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
The possibility of

924
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,824
An outbreak of hostilities more likely than they were before

925
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,151
Trump isn't trying to create peace he's f****** with people

926
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Civilians are the ones who are going to

927
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Pay the price ultimate

928
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
This is ghoulish stuff

929
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
And for Alex to cheerlead this order bulshit

930
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Really upsetting

931
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Yeah

932
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Pretty bad

933
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
Yeah

934
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
It's

935
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
It's kind of mind-boggling

936
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,023
It really isn't even that thought process of like

937
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,607
Oh well we did something stupid so they're going to respond proportion

938
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Finally and we can respond for porch

939
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Let's just

940
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
That's just dumb

941
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
I mean it's just really really dumb we have

942
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
All of human history to point out how dumb that is

943
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
18

944
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
We can't

945
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
Boiled down global conflict into a Hatfield versus

946
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Is The McCoys

947
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:34,623
Situation where you take one I take one we just do this forever and ever

948
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
That's f****** incredible

949
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Yeah

950
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Not

951
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Right

952
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
No

953
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
No it's not right

954
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
It's not regular truck just f******

955
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,887
Presses a button and a dude dies in

956
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
That means but

957
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Because of that because

958
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Trump is a f****** lunatic

959
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,543
No people who have nothing to do with that s*** are going to

960
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,615
That's just a thing

961
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,455
The situation we find ourselves in is one of escalation

962
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Supposed to

963
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
Closer to

964
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,879
To progress and there's no way that you can negotiate anything with Trump

965
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,207
It's like it doesn't seem like it with if your Iran

966
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,303
I don't know way to negotiate

967
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Anybody

968
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
You're anybody why would you

969
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
Yeah you can't trust anyone

970
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Okay we've

971
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
Negotiated this well

972
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Anything that he

973
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,311
He's ever negotiated he's just redic. So

974
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
You can only even deescalate this war

975
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
After Trump is gone

976
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
That's it

977
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,343
And even then you probably be a little bit wary because

978
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,391
Decide to tear up this agreement to

979
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Yeah

980
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
I don't I don't know

981
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
It's at

982
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Desert adopt

983
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
Pics of it are really traveling

984
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
I guess that's kind of

985
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,191
The end result of us having such a

986
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,311
Addie emphasis on diplomacy

987
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
It's just it's just a mess

988
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
It is well and truly

989
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
The thing is

990
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Global

991
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
The ones are doing all this stuff really feel like it

992
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,367
It's still just Trump and who's his guide

993
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
No but I really do

994
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
Okay never

995
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
The globalist wanted to embarrass

996
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Trump with the situation

997
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
At the embassy

998
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Anorak

999
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
That was that was their plan

1000
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,935
But now Trump has gone and done this

1001
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
Assassination right

1002
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
Switch ruined the globalist

1003
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,335
Plans are blocked it somehow now listen to this clip

1004
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,967
I would posit that the way Alex is framing this is very much a positive thing

1005
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
If he's

1006
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Blood enemies are the globalist

1007
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
And they were trying to embarrass his

1008
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:45,439
Hero and his hero stopped of their plans to embarrass it through this

1009
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
It must be a good thing

1010
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
They want to use Iran to embarrass from

1011
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,823
Is winning the political war

1012
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,407
Are you afraid to go to the mailbox because it letter after letter from the IRS

1013
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:10,527
Cut up by the break their man get a lot of commercials about tax settled syllable away from

1014
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,087
Cutting a cutting to break on time and it

1015
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
It's just

1016
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Gastly

1017
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
I just I see that Alex is cut

1018
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,559
Lucky's pretty regularly giving lip service to the idea of like we don't know what kind

1019
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Next

1020
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
That kind of know how they're going to respond

1021
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,703
It's a dangerous possibility

1022
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Sometime everything that he's

1023
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Putting this

1024
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
The language surrounding it is

1025
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
Trump made a big political win

1026
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Yeah that's a bold move

1027
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
Surrounding

1028
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Adjectives reuses are very Potter

1029
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
It's it's a soft

1030
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
Pressure campaign 2

1031
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,511
Influence people into thinking that regardless of whether or not they want war with Iran

1032
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Trump is right

1033
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
To do what he did

1034
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
Right and you know what its defense

1035
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,191
Because the Ayatollah

1036
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
You taunted Trump

1037
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
What is the Ayatollah say to Trump

1038
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
I said you can do

1039
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Nothing

1040
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
You can't do

1041
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Any

1042
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Then why would you say that again about

1043
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
The treason

1044
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
John Kerry

1045
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Barack Obama

1046
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
Who travel the world

1047
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Korea to Japan

1048
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
The China

1049
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,775
To Iran to Israel to Germany to the UK

1050
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Canada

1051
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
2

1052
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Argentina

1053
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Brazil

1054
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Don't listen to Trump

1055
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
He's going to be gone soon he's a loser he's an idiot

1056
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,671
In fact if you embarrass him

1057
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
Sinking some ships

1058
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Strait of Hormuz

1059
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
Remove him back at home and he's not going to get the bike

1060
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:10,335
So John Kerry and Obama apparently not US citizens because they're globulus to run all over the world like little

1061
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:16,735
Legos Whispering into world leaders years if they should have Barrister you listening to this childish

1062
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Bananas

1063
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Here again

1064
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
And Alex is using

1065
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Vagueness as a weapon

1066
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
Okay

1067
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,671
So you're asserting the Kerry and Obama told these foreign heads

1068
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
The state to sink ships

1069
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
The Straits of Hormuz

1070
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Prove it

1071
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
That's a serious accusation that Alex

1072
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
Skidaway

1073
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Substantiate

1074
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
Leaves

1075
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Get the f*** out of here

1076
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
Yeah or retract

1077
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:49,247
Good present a episode where I don't think we have at least middling grounds for a libel defamation

1078
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,551
Other public figures

1079
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
There's a part of our relation

1080
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:58,719
Community that almost certainly has been putting out of vibe of like Trump going to be gone eventually

1081
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,047
That's probably because he's threatening long-standing Alliance

1082
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Relationship

1083
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
People who dedicated their lives

1084
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,191
The international relations work aren't going to see

1085
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
See Trump get elected watch him

1086
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,311
Rap about how our closest allies are paying enough into NATO

1087
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,175
And just shrug and be like well I guess who's the boss now this is what we do yeah no kidding

1088
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Against their lives work

1089
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,575
Course they would be trying to reassure people that they have

1090
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
It was a long-standing relations with

1091
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Like a please

1092
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
Please look look

1093
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
I know whatever

1094
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,071
But the accusation that any of them were going to go around until countries to commit provocative actions like sink

1095
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
You can ship that really needs to be

1096
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
That was never going to do that cuz

1097
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
Who's making this s*** up

1098
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,031
Look the issue is to that the these are Ronnie and mullahs

1099
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Other

1100
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,895
And talk about that Alex drops in

1101
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Rephrase

1102
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
CentraState

1103
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
I mean when you think about the Iranian mullahs

1104
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,599
Quadruple games of cats

1105
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Strategic

1106
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
It's mental illness

1107
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
Break shooting is the most sophisticated

1108
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
University

1109
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Sophisticated

1110
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
It's so

1111
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,399
Simplest complex these guys don't get it

1112
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
They don't get the Christian

1113
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,775
Saxon Legos or

1114
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
Access or orgenesis

1115
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Very sad

1116
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
Firstmark close

1117
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,967
Just appointed I've never heard Alex talk about logos

1118
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,807
Before and you can tell that he's new to the concept because he pronounced it Legos

1119
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
That's e Michael Jones

1120
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Alex's drift

1121
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
And a territory

1122
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
Activities talking about these are Ronnie and Milos mulas not having Anglo-Saxon Legos

1123
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
Not good

1124
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,703
That's a pretty bad sign

1125
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
What is

1126
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Then now

1127
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
I guess the most

1128
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,223
Complex thing is this Simplicity yes shut the be like

1129
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
Right

1130
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:03,391
Whatever you don't even tell me about straight-shooting when you're just lying to my face all the time later

1131
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,791
And later he's going to talk about Trump like being engaged in this 4D chess stop where it's like he makes a boob

1132
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Really about something I like

1133
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
That's not straight shooting assholes

1134
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,703
Yes but straight-shooting is the best way to

1135
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Trick people

1136
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,335
Everything is like a f****** convoluted nonsensical

1137
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Accusing

1138
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,943
Obama and Kerry Estates General McMaster types

1139
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
I'm going around and telling around 2

1140
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Sink ships and stuff like that

1141
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,159
It makes it more funny when he says this about why people don't want him on a

1142
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
Please remember

1143
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,791
When you share the link that infowars.com live show

1144
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,863
. video and Alex Young section more

1145
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,727
This show because we're really covering real facts

1146
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:56,127
Establishment

1147
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:00,479
Outside well we do have a side it's called the truth

1148
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
Like the reminder

1149
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,671
I'd like to remind you that under oath when asked about the show he said that is mostly opinion

1150
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
No they want me off here because

1151
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
Truth. Telling you how the world

1152
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Works

1153
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
So

1154
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
Alex comes back

1155
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
Break and you talkin about how

1156
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,007
Ron is muscling through the Middle East

1157
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
And how eventually that

1158
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
It's going to be

1159
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
Essentially saying that this is a world domination

1160
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
When you're using

1161
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
Rhetoric like this

1162
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
This is the way your framing things

1163
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
It really is

1164
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
Adjust application for

1165
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
And I don't

1166
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,439
That is an unfair way to characterize what's behind what he say

1167
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
When is muffling its way through the Middle East

1168
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Blaziken topple

1169
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
The other Islamic regimes

1170
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:58,591
And if that happens you'll have an organized Islamic Force even more deadly with three billion Muslims ready to take over what's left

1171
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
West

1172
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
Long-term

1173
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
Taking I ran out of the control of

1174
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
The captured

1175
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
The secular country

1176
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,231
And we can take that away

1177
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
The radical islamist

1178
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
Wow

1179
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,191
We are I mean like the unpopularity of the regime in Tehran

1180
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
It's not really a just

1181
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
Application for this at all

1182
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,591
I don't know I don't I don't feel like this argument

1183
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,407
Is very good well all I can tell you is that

1184
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:38,783
Every other time that the United States is f***** around with regime change in Iran it is worked out

1185
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,855
Perfectly every time that you press

1186
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Things with like

1187
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,951
You know hey the people would really love it if you did

1188
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
Weird

1189
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,047
Not really worked out though

1190
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
There's a

1191
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,095
If you

1192
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Watch

1193
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,215
If you watch those videos of people screaming death to America and you don't at least go well

1194
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
I understand how we got

1195
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
Then your disingenuous liar

1196
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
That's the only way

1197
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,919
What are the things I think was probably the

1198
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
One of the hardest hurdles that Alex needs

1199
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Queer is the fact

1200
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
Did Trump do this without informing concur

1201
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Right

1202
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
Pretty problematic for Alex's beliefs about the war powers that the President should or should not

1203
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
Not have right he likes

1204
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
The Constitution write love

1205
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Loves it

1206
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,607
Can't Get Enough

1207
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Bathe

1208
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
In the Constitution

1209
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Truly is not

1210
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,751
But it turns out that the secrecy was totally fine

1211
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
He's not telling

1212
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,919
What's going on he fired the moles National Security Council

1213
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
He's really

1214
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Pelosi

1215
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,087
House and Senate intelligence committee what he's doing now

1216
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,647
Tell why because their globalist a lot of them

1217
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
The information

1218
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
Oh fun

1219
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
I didn't know that that was all you needed that's all the excuse you needed to support the Constitution I need everyone is out there almost

1220
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,215
I've just decided they're all Global they're all moles

1221
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,615
What we should do is Target political enemies call them traitors and remove them from Power that's how

1222
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,687
How you get a more perfect democracy dancer

1223
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:15,039
I guess that all of Alex's like protestations about former

1224
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:19,135
Military actions that were taken without the approval of Congress

1225
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:24,511
Just be noted it's no big deal as long as

1226
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Congress

1227
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
It's really kind of funny

1228
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
Timmy that

1229
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
As as brexit is going on it's

1230
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,823
It's like Boris Johnson is trying to sell England into a United States colladay

1231
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,687
And at the same time the United States has a bunch of people trying to turn the president into a cake

1232
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,479
So it's a it's a twist

1233
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Austin events

1234
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
Weird

1235
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
So Alex

1236
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Get down to

1237
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Business

1238
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,183
And he keeps calling the decision to Trump made

1239
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
I think that's something worth highlighter

1240
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,095
Not just stick some Iranian Patrol motor

1241
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,143
Melissa was some more

1242
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Fighter jets that's what

1243
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,007
Bill Clinton did when he was very unpopular in an impeachment

1244
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
Yes

1245
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
Bring up that parallel

1246
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,943
Dot-com

1247
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
Bill Clinton impeached

1248
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Bombs Iraq

1249
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:25,183
Impeachment vote in house delayed as Clinton launches Iraq airstrike

1250
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
I need to move

1251
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
Nothing actually happened

1252
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:33,375
In Iraq when he did that already Bond aspirin Factory in Sudan

1253
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Distraction

1254
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
This is real

1255
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
What Benicar

1256
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Embassy was attacked

1257
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
Because they've been probing and we've been putting up with

1258
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
And so instead of bombing

1259
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
An aspirin Factory

1260
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
Boldly

1261
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Killed

1262
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
The leader

1263
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
The organization that has sleeper cells

1264
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
Inside the United States

1265
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
Now that's

1266
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,815
Even though that'll blow up in their face

1267
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
And the UFO and even bigger

1268
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
How to connect a light into a wider Regional War

1269
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,079
And so this is a really bad decision

1270
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,431
But it's one of the best decisions you can make out of a lift of even

1271
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Worst decisions

1272
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:26,111
So just for fun Steve pieczenik when he's on later Alex brings up the ideas sleeper cells and Caesar

1273
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,695
Feel a little better

1274
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Disagreement

1275
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,767
On the show

1276
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:38,399
Largely I would agree with Alex at this was a bad decision but I'm going to take issue with the characterization that it was the best

1277
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
On a list

1278
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
Awards choice

1279
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,543
Considering there was an actual list according to the New York Times and it was supposedly

1280
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
The worst on that list at almost

1281
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
Topically the worst on that list

1282
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,943
Except if he did this

1283
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
I was on the list

1284
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
US Embassy was targeted and that's

1285
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Not good

1286
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,623
And you think that you need to do something to respond to that

1287
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,695
Assassinating

1288
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,511
I really think that should be on the list of possible choices

1289
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,143
Particularly considering that that standoff at the embassy had already ended by the time Trump

1290
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
According to USA

1291
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
Today quote

1292
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
Militia Leaders with

1293
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,567
The popular mobilization forces ultimately ordered supporters to retreat

1294
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,895
Declaring the demonstration to win in the battle to expel US troops

1295
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Iraq

1296
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
There was no immediate threat there was a

1297
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
Situation to deal with

1298
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,039
The target assassination

1299
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
Probably not appropriate

1300
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
I'm not certain I knows but

1301
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,927
Pacifically what a good decision would have been

1302
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,511
But that's only because I would never be in this situation we find ourselves into

1303
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
To begin with

1304
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,167
None of this would probably have happening if Trump hadn't arbitrarily exited the Iran nuclear deal

1305
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Your sanction

1306
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,287
Which kind of destroys the framework that was building for our two countries to become a

1307
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
How does a stronger understanding and hopefully

1308
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Some sort of progress

1309
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
Between the two

1310
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,479
After that point yeah I guess all options are bad

1311
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
But still this

1312
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
Not the best of a list of bad choices

1313
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,623
I just feel like Alex is trying to rationalize the

1314
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
The possibility of an

1315
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
Upcoming War

1316
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
That's really all I feel

1317
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
He's setting the groundwork so he can be like

1318
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,863
It's the Final War the whole

1319
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,263
And create at least some sort of

1320
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
The pretense that he didn't want it

1321
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,759
I I don't know what would be the best reaction but I know if I were somebody who went on air everyday and screamed

1322
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
About Jesus and God

1323
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:35,647
For several hours at least look into what

1324
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,439
Jesus would feel about

1325
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
The war

1326
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,559
Drones don't come up in the Bible that's true I guess Jesus would be fine

1327
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
Said

1328
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,679
Alex has been very against drone

1329
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
Stop

1330
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
The Pasty

1331
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,311
You took it probably fairly rightly

1332
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,151
Obama to task about the Drone program

1333
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,967
Alex doesn't seem to be too concerned with that

1334
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
Now

1335
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,783
And now he calls this peace through strength

1336
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,343
Let's roll some of the footage of the strike

1337
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Re from the

1338
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Reaper

1339
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,487
Drone robot detailing

1340
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
Animal show you some of the footage

1341
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
From the ground

1342
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
As well but those guys

1343
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
But they were touchable they thought they were working with the Deep State they thought

1344
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Well now

1345
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
They think death

1346
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
Will restrain

1347
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,455
On the Deep State trying to set him up with this Iran

1348
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,343
And tell you better understanding when you have Colitis going to get a lot more serious than their non

1349
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Campbell

1350
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,535
What's wrong

1351
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
I don't care about any of that stuff

1352
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,399
It's nonsense

1353
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:55,775
So Alex already has brought up a parallel to Clinton

1354
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
What he was under a p

1355
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
Stuff

1356
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
And apparently AOC

1357
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,735
Alexandria ocasio-cortez has come out and said the Trump is wagging

1358
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
The dog

1359
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,831
And Alex takes great issue with her comments

1360
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Swag Dog

1361
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
Clinton was super unpopular

1362
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,607
Trump super popular

1363
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
He's just

1364
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Insanely popular

1365
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
Every Democrat I know

1366
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,823
That is a ghost sad person

1367
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
Stop it

1368
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Temperature

1369
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,319
Lake with the Democrats everyone knows they work for the globalist tonight America

1370
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,159
I don't I don't know like what kind of self-selecting Democrats

1371
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Hang out with Alex

1372
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:51,327
Are you probably just be like yeah

1373
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:57,215
Yeah yeah there's no way to get around there's no conversation no and if you don't want to maintain

1374
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,055
Seems like my family

1375
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:06,175
Doctor fun you guys have kids grades so nothing else

1376
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,063
I don't know if you know this Jordan puts a Gallop keeps historical data of presidential approval ratings week by week

1377
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
Pretty much all modern present

1378
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,743
Look up which I decided to clearly if I recall correctly in 1998 Bill Clinton

1379
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Had

1380
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
Negative

1381
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,839
5% approval rating

1382
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,399
People dead

1383
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
Did not approve of him

1384
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
Right Alex is going on about how Trump isn't wagging the dog

1385
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,847
Because he's super popular where has Bill Clinton was because he was

1386
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
Super unpopular

1387
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,919
When I went out to Bob

1388
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
Froggy Went A-Courtin

1389
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
Clint without a bombing

1390
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,879
The right now Trump has a 42.5% approval rating with a 50

1391
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
3% disapproval rating according to

1392
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
The aggregate compiled by 5:30

1393
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,559
RealClearPolitics a listing of recent polls

1394
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,143
Literally none of them have Trump with a net positive approval number

1395
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,215
The average of their poles have trumpeted - 7

1396
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
And the old

1397
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,799
Glimmer of hope is a recent Rasmussen

1398
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,639
The end of 2019 to put drop-in even numbers 50

1399
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
D50

1400
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:14,015
And it should be pointed out that this was not a poll of registered voters

1401
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
So

1402
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,367
Listen Pulsar you got a what

1403
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,951
Three bias on that a little bit

1404
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,511
Conservative friends

1405
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Not terribly

1406
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
The political is trumpet negative

1407
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,655
NBC Wall Street Journal azimut - 10

1408
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,703
Economist at -9

1409
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
His numbers are not good

1410
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:39,103
His approval ratings are decidedly underwater and with the level of dislike Trump has

1411
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
Pretty high things around aren't good

1412
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
They're just not many people

1413
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
You could sway at the

1414
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
Yeah I didn't Bill get up to like

1415
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,855
70 at one point that dude

1416
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:56,255
Wildly popular for a while so the movie Wag the Dog was released very shortly before Clinton

1417
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Operation in

1418
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,351
Infinite reach which involve bombings in Afghanistan and Sudan

1419
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,399
This operation began on August

1420
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:05,983
20th 1998 at which point Clinton's approval rating was

1421
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
65% approval

1422
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
If thirty percent

1423
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Cent disapproval

1424
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,407
By December 1998 Clinton was admits to his impeachment trial

1425
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,711
In that setting he started bombing Iraq

1426
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
Switch again made people think of the movie

1427
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
That bombing campaign started on December 16th 1998

1428
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,439
At which point Clinton's approval rating was 63% approval

1429
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,207
33 +

1430
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Disapproval

1431
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
After that bombing campaign his numbers jumped

1432
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
To 73% approval

1433
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,143
But they quickly came back

1434
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
To the item ID

1435
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
Almost

1436
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
After January 1990

1437
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,823
86 Clinton never had an approval rating lower than

1438
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,175
Ain't no point during his dog wagging phase with Clinton

1439
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,991
Approval rating in his right now

1440
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,271
How does he drink

1441
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,087
Complete denial or he's gaslighting his audience into thing

1442
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,903
Is euro is actually beloved yeah there's no other way

1443
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,255
Whatever the case is real

1444
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
False that upside-down real

1445
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
Complete inversion of reality

1446
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Absolutely

1447
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,751
So we can more talk of how bold was

1448
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Drop here

1449
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,335
And then after this Alex starts taking calls

1450
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,151
And I think this is where the show starts to get a little bit like

1451
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Oh no

1452
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,247
Okay Ono alright so here's our last sort of

1453
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Normal

1454
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
. of the

1455
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,575
The show where Alex is

1456
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,671
Pretending to be covering the Iran situation but not really doing much of any

1457
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:35,327
Well President Trump did something very bold yesterday blowing up some

1458
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,727
He killed soleimani

1459
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,335
Islamic Republic of Iran

1460
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
I know the song now got a joke

1461
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,479
So he's now Alex is escalating this to he is the head of a rock

1462
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
Yeah so like this

1463
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
Even more of a severe app

1464
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:01,439
Yeah we assassinated the leader of a Sovereign Nation and that's a bold move

1465
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
Be something that Alex says

1466
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
No no that's fine it's me it just be like if we assassinate energy drinks that be fine then

1467
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
Okay fine let's go with

1468
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,871
F******

1469
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:26,527
It's a very serious thing even in reality and Alex's framing it escalates things

1470
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,343
Further and he's normalizing the rationalizing

1471
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
That which is

1472
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
Pretty scary

1473
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
What what

1474
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
What is

1475
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,511
Too far

1476
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
So Alex Goes to the phone

1477
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
On his first caller that he takes

1478
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
Is a fan

1479
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
And

1480
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
He feels like Alex's

1481
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
Betrayed him a little bit

1482
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
Thanks for calling what's on your mind

1483
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
I don't really worry about

1484
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
The direction we're having right now

1485
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,039
Real quick just so you know that

1486
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Wife says I'm your big

1487
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:05,695
We're divorced

1488
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
Give you the best

1489
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,471
Barely besides we are

1490
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,519
You like that

1491
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,871
I can't do a push-up

1492
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,503
I thought I was just

1493
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,599
What's your take on YouTube, sleeper cells due process

1494
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,927
The real quick before we get to his answer at that moment is heartbreaking

1495
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
That moment of

1496
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Push your products

1497
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:45,119
Yeah I've been your biggest fan I spent thousands of dollars at your store my wife's is under biggest fan

1498
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,399
All this like

1499
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:50,239
And Alex is like oh this is going to be eaten even recognize the alike

1500
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,895
I ate like she doesn't know the meaning of that no

1501
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
Now's not the time

1502
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,479
Understanding me

1503
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,807
To tell you recognize this

1504
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,415
The Call by saying we drifted a long way from the Ron Paul days

1505
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:11,999
Caller is not calling to compliment

1506
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Recognize

1507
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
I'm here

1508
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Years of color

1509
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,959
I just feel like we're just a long way from you now

1510
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,151
I understand but they've got us caught sir they've got that

1511
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,967
I don't want this War I don't like what happened yesterday okay

1512
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,759
Video doesn't make me get excited

1513
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
At the same time

1514
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
You understand

1515
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,999
That would love letter working with Iran

1516
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,303
At a certain level to try to make Trump look stupid

1517
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,911
They can only make him look stupid by

1518
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Coerce him into a war

1519
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
The best way to make

1520
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
Very different

1521
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
From where we were when we were with us

1522
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,551
So I think this collar

1523
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,623
Something really interesting which is a rebuttal within Alex

1524
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,207
Does framework yeah because even if you do believe the globalists are trying

1525
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
To manipulate this s***

1526
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
The answer within

1527
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
The framework is

1528
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,631
Well the only way that that is successful as if Trump goes to war

1529
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,727
You don't support this s*** even within Alex's

1530
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
Constructed

1531
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
World of

1532
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
Of intriguing and cancel

1533
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Seriously

1534
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,407
Still he's doing the wrong thing

1535
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:38,015
I think it's called her like I mean

1536
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,159
Yeah I think his point that we've come a long way for Ron Paul

1537
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,719
Behavior is

1538
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,255
A contradiction

1539
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
So much of what

1540
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
You

1541
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,375
Backed his brand to be if he's been a fan of his for a long time

1542
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
And it would be completely different if Alex

1543
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
One day

1544
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,751
I got non-air and been like look

1545
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,311
I know we've been one thing for a really long time

1546
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
But I realize that's not it

1547
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,919
That's like what I was saying along

1548
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
If he invalidated a large

1549
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,271
Portion of his past intentionally

1550
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,807
Do I have recognized

1551
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
That the true path

1552
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Is flu

1553
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,695
Antagonizing the Muslim world

1554
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,375
If you have something like that then it would make it a lot more understandable for the fan

1555
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,167
Assess

1556
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,215
Do I want to come along for this

1557
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
Or do I want to say

1558
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Hey

1559
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
This is

1560
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
For me anymore

1561
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
Announces allowing

1562
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
Is audience that Opera

1563
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
I think that's probably not

1564
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,479
Yeah what he just said they're IAAI

1565
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
Iconstituent is almost

1566
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Like that like

1567
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Then he recognized

1568
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,975
Oh no I'm I'm getting attacked from my own

1569
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,047
My own folk here from hyper massive failings if you'd like

1570
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
I don't want to war either

1571
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,191
But we have to have a war

1572
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
And you know

1573
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:07,871
Nobody you've never heard that before you never heard anybody say that they don't want to war and we have to have one day

1574
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
They always say they want

1575
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,479
And this isn't the only

1576
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Express disapproval

1577
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:18,879
Pretty good disapproval is got to be like

1578
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,927
Listening to that has to be a massive

1579
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
Betrayal of everything that

1580
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,487
Dave Lee

1581
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,071
Yeah I think I think it's getting to a point

1582
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
I am only guessing

1583
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,167
It just imagining what it would be like

1584
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
To be one of his lesson

1585
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,495
If you are somebody who has

1586
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,543
Modicum of awareness

1587
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,823
And I think

1588
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
A bit yeah

1589
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
It would be very difficult to experience

1590
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Constant

1591
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,479
Dissonance between what this was

1592
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,271
Supposed to be and what Alex is

1593
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Is doing

1594
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,599
And I think it'll be really difficult to not feel like

1595
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
When

1596
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,695
If Alex isn't going to say enough

1597
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
At some point when do I

1598
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,327
Yeah what is the point at which I realize that this is off the rails

1599
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,143
Yeah and if I say enough to Alex

1600
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,959
Do I say enough to

1601
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,775
What am I saying enough

1602
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
When I say enough to

1603
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591
It's a it's an interesting

1604
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,175
Situation that I would imagine the number of his listeners are in

1605
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
I don't I don't know

1606
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
Just guessing say like it's a lot

1607
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Episode

1608
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,367
It seems like there is at least some of that sentiment

1609
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
It's getting through on a

1610
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
It's pretty interesting

1611
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,023
Anytime I try and put myself in that mindset

1612
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
Regardless of

1613
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,911
Like the beliefs or opinions or anything with no

1614
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,703
Contacts there

1615
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,263
It just has to be an identity

1616
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,823
Like that's the only way that I can

1617
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
Like empathize with a

1618
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,431
Alex Jones listener

1619
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,455
Beyond

1620
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
You know it's just

1621
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Imagine if

1622
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,295
All the sudden Bernie Sanders is like

1623
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
Actually this war is f****** great

1624
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
You know that's an identity crisis

1625
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Like what the fuc

1626
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,975
Yeah or something even more so to Slippery lie

1627
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Like

1628
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:04,607
Alex is doing this we have to do it

1629
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:10,239
Yeah I've heard those words before from the mouths of people you said were Eve

1630
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:15,359
So Alex takes another call and this guy believes that

1631
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
Wioa Ron

1632
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Overthrowing their God

1633
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
Because of

1634
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,991
The shop or something

1635
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,391
Cuz of the other times we've overthrow their we did bad the last time we need to make up for it right

1636
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,951
By getting rid of the Ayatollah

1637
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,511
Repeating history is a brilliant idea

1638
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
It certainly is

1639
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,351
Joseph they got rid of the Shah I think us

1640
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,935
Always stay raining

1641
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
People

1642
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,567
Basically a payback to the Ayatollah because they brought him in

1643
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:49,407
And I think you asked me to help that uranium people just empowered

1644
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:02,207
So this caller claims to be the child of former Irani and counterintelligence couple like his parents workout

1645
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
Counterintelligence in the erotic Museum

1646
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,559
They were driven out of the country

1647
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,327
The Ayatollah

1648
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,095
Came to power

1649
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,495
I have no idea if that's true or not this is just a random person calling into a very dumb radio show so claim however you feel like

1650
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,847
Whatever the reality is I'm certain that Alex would have argued against

1651
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Two parents immigrated to the United

1652
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,455
It states if you had a chance to

1653
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,551
The only reason I got this clip is because Alex at the end

1654
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Support for something

1655
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,647
Express support for which is the restart a run

1656
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,231
Restart A-Rod was started by Syed Mohammed hossain

1657
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
A former game show host who wants to restart the country

1658
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,143
According to 2018 peace and Bloomberg

1659
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
2011

1660
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:48,287
Today he lives in America and urges Ronnie

1661
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,359
Rossini began spray

1662
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,895
Snow in Toronto

1663
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:56,223
I'll send you began spreading his message on telegram ultimately having a

1664
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,807
Rocks through government building

1665
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
And film it

1666
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
Supposed with his hashtag

1667
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
With telegram considered

1668
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Vandalism contest

1669
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,511
That just got him a warning though

1670
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,839
He raised the stakes and told his followers

1671
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
Cocktails in tomorrow

1672
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
That might be too

1673
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,215
Oh no it seems like a pretty f***** up dude

1674
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
That sounds like a

1675
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:22,591
Really want to litigate the properties of violent protests in the face of an oppressive regime

1676
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,663
Play except there are good arguments on both sides of that discussion

1677
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
However I do think

1678
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,343
It's someone like hussaini trying to encourage that kind of behavior while living in the United States are not ever

1679
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
It's something that I find

1680
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,439
Do not be a good model for positive social progress

1681
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
Probably

1682
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
I think that Alex just likes

1683
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,023
Because

1684
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
He has publicly compared himself to

1685
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
Trump a number of times in the past

1686
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,191
Highlighting how they're both former TV stars

1687
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,031
Alex is painfully susceptible to people who make their brand

1688
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
IMAX

1689
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,335
Country's version of trump

1690
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:58,431
Yeah they just can't eat the catnip to I love you

1691
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Yeah

1692
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Ridiculous

1693
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:02,783
And if their favor

1694
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,623
He is very much a star

1695
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
That doesn't

1696
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
To be the case

1697
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
So this

1698
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,487
Colored says Vapes

1699
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Hey

1700
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Trump

1701
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,071
We got our support

1702
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,399
Because there's got to be a maginary intelligence

1703
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
That we don't know about

1704
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,983
Doesn't when will people learn

1705
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
There doesn't

1706
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,543
Have to be imaginary until

1707
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,847
They're willing to lie

1708
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,639
There's imaginary until

1709
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
And then this person the conversation

1710
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
Steers into

1711
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,295
Divine Providence

1712
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
Warren issue

1713
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,023
Should I not go

1714
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
Forum

1715
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,327
We cannot believe it because there's

1716
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
There's so much going on

1717
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
Everything that's going on

1718
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
I completely understand

1719
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
Believe that

1720
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Okay

1721
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,951
Okay

1722
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
Stop believe

1723
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,791
I strongly disagree

1724
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:24,191
When you're on a show that's complaining about a theocracy in Iran

1725
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,727
Say that your president was

1726
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,543
Chosen by God

1727
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
There's a slight

1728
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,103
Problem

1729
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
That's

1730
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,663
I would say that

1731
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,455
That is

1732
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
Purely unacceptable way of think

1733
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,855
Yeah you know like yes regardless of

1734
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
Just that idea of like

1735
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,487
Well you know he made one bad decision so we still have to

1736
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Support head

1737
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
Is like okay

1738
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
Put

1739
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,375
Green peppers on the pizza that

1740
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,655
And you don't like green peppers

1741
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
I get it you still support the guys

1742
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
As president

1743
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,263
He starts World War 3

1744
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:05,663
I think then we need to start talking about other options I even understand I even understand that kind of mentality

1745
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,967
Being acceptable in terms of like kind of

1746
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Border Collie

1747
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:15,391
Yeah there's some time to do political decisions that have really negative consequences that may or may not

1748
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
Abby

1749
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,999
Justifiable

1750
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
As you can kind of take

1751
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
The position of

1752
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,095
Hey that was really bad but

1753
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
That's it

1754
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,911
Make you right

1755
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:30,751
But I don't think that applies to Prince of process versus results

1756
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
True you know like

1757
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:39,455
That's why it's hard to show your work and that's why it's important exactly on vague ideas of imaginary

1758
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
Exactly

1759
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,831
Promise that the caller has a ton of stuff we don't know

1760
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,367
No

1761
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Is left to be seen

1762
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Until we know

1763
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,719
Whether or not

1764
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:53,535
The secret stuff

1765
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,095
Extra

1766
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,143
It's unclear

1767
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,447
Guys instant assumption is they like

1768
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:04,031
Wow yeah everything that we don't know justifies all this

1769
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
That's why we got a keeper

1770
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
Keep supporting the God can

1771
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
Boggle by

1772
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
That idea of

1773
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,807
Anytime somebody has asked for evidence from Trump

1774
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
Regarding

1775
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Any

1776
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
Possible thing

1777
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
It is operations

1778
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,719
Right there is nothing

1779
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,535
Nobody's ever been like

1780
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,143
It's either we're not going to share any of it into or the evidence we do share makes him look like a psycho

1781
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
Seems like

1782
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,007
So there's a preoccupation that the embassy

1783
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
Situation

1784
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
In Baghdad was supposed to

1785
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
2B Trump's Benghazi

1786
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,895
This is something that keeps coming up this

1787
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,967
Comparing Benghazi to the Embassy

1788
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,015
Do you see that you're a little bit

1789
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,575
Daniel Khan's in the CIA

1790
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,903
Wanted a war so they made a little packed with their leftist

1791
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,439
CIA

1792
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
They could have a bye

1793
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,047
You know what the situation but either way the Deep

1794
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
Say when

1795
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
And then Sean

1796
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
Trump comes out of

1797
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,959
Field has killed our leader

1798
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,751
Dino ranus IHOP

1799
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
On the beach

1800
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,079
Dayton 1 a.m. projected American

1801
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:15,455
Power boosted at 3

1802
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,599
It's him I get chills I mean

1803
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
I mean I agree it smells of him

1804
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,719
Let's not start you know what yet my clothes doesn't Pulp Fiction but

1805
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,535
Right now looks like a masterstroke by Trump just saying

1806
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
Masterstroke

1807
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,423
This caller is laughing about the the attack

1808
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
This is all very

1809
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,263
Positive stuff like I isn't really

1810
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:44,383
Outside of a couple of callers who are like expressing the thing like the guys that we drifted

1811
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
Ron Paul

1812
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,199
I typed that there's

1813
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
Not as much

1814
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,503
Negative

1815
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,295
Expression

1816
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,367
And what it does, comes in like really f***** up ways I

1817
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
The next caller

1818
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,463
Let's just go ahead and get to that because this is kind of

1819
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,767
A negative like this

1820
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
Attack wasn't

1821
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Good

1822
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,351
But the way it is it

1823
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
It's Express

1824
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
Is deeply deeply troubling

1825
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
Herself with Iran

1826
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:14,848
We need to treat Iran like a bee's nest what do you do with a bee's nest in your yard

1827
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
You have two options

1828
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,176
Ephraim it

1829
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,760
Wait until the evening comes every become home to nest

1830
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,344
Kill every single one and destroys an s

1831
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Iranian

1832
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
Literally believe

1833
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,232
To bring

1834
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,816
Apocalypse in the end of the world

1835
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,168
We believe that the twelfth Imam is just going to show up and Iran and save them all

1836
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,704
So this caller is Express

1837
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
Sing like this attack isn't

1838
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Good

1839
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,080
Because we need to do is leave them alone or commit genocide

1840
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
This is not

1841
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
Acceptable stuff to be disliked

1842
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,944
Discussing on this radio

1843
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,504
That is not like Alex shouldn't be

1844
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,040
Alex engages with

1845
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,064
The bees nest

1846
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
Metaphor after that

1847
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
You shouldn't be doing that

1848
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,440
You should push back on that

1849
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,000
This guy is explicitly using a metaphor

1850
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:04,768
That is

1851
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,328
Eradicate

1852
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,632
One of the two those are the only two options

1853
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
Because all the Ronnie ins

1854
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
You're the one

1855
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,776
The world and that just is not

1856
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,104
There's no way there's no way then

1857
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
That that can be

1858
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Appropriate

1859
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
As Converse

1860
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
No I

1861
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Just don't

1862
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
I just don't

1863
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,344
I don't I didn't cuz I

1864
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,136
I'm on a very

1865
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,072
That's just Psychopathic murderer

1866
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:43,424
Like you can't talk

1867
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,984
Disguises disguises

1868
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:50,848
Whatever she's never going to be able to do genocide or anything but that thought process

1869
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
Is very much

1870
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
In his world

1871
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
F****** Psychopathic murderer

1872
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,808
Domestic Relations

1873
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,624
My complaint about it is too full one

1874
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
It's horrible

1875
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
Perspective that this caller has

1876
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:11,072
When Alex allows callers to call in and express these sorts of things and not push back on it but not

1877
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,144
Discuss why that is a dangerous idea it has

1878
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
Effective normalize

1879
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,984
Effective like oh that is a position

1880
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,032
Spit Alex deemed worth it

1881
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,616
And for any impressionable listeners they're going to

1882
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Much less shocked

1883
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
By the car

1884
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
Concept of extermination

1885
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
And just the way that

1886
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,296
It's being discussed

1887
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,576
Yeah like this.

1888
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,856
This is

1889
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Tragedy

1890
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,928
Even if you think that even if you think

1891
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,488
Honestly in the long-term that this is better

1892
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
This is all a f******

1893
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Tragedy

1894
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,072
It should be

1895
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,096
Talked about it

1896
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,888
Yeah

1897
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
Center on

1898
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,520
The civilians

1899
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
Disposition by

1900
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,128
Geopolitical ship

1901
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Yeah

1902
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
So I would argue that

1903
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
On the 5th

1904
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
2020

1905
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
I'm not into it

1906
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,280
I did think the 2019 was a bad year but 2020 is really shaping up to be a dude it's a small sample size

1907
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
So

1908
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,120
Maybe the year will get back

1909
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:21,472
Pandora getting to the hear Alex has a slightly different

1910
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,264
For sure

1911
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,824
2020 has to be amazing

1912
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
Every way

1913
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,456
Dr. nography

1914
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,760
I just

1915
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,296
The numbers alone

1916
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,648
Incredible

1917
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,720
Call here

1918
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,536
I think it's going to be incredible and

1919
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
Because it's amazing how to restart the show

1920
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
Record traffic

1921
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:51,168
Yeah these sorts of events have a tendency toward

1922
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,960
Giving him hope that is business

1923
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,264
Viable

1924
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,824
Right nobody knows what the hell is going on

1925
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
So

1926
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,640
Let's see what the crazy person has

1927
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
But he's willing to give us cold comfort

1928
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Sure

1929
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Let's take a little boy

1930
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,040
Sure from the show

1931
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
And enjoy a commercial

1932
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,160
I was listening to I accidentally left it on during the commercials

1933
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
The feed

1934
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,488
And it turns out the

1935
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,768
No

1936
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
The guy who runs

1937
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:22,656
Genesis Communications Network and formerly Midas resources before he had his gold sale license

1938
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,936
Provoked by the state of Maine

1939
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
Minnesota and Alex said to

1940
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Probably help him

1941
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
Pay off some

1942
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,824
The legal fees

1943
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,616
Maybe

1944
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Anyway

1945
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
This guy

1946
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,944
Still running scams

1947
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
I kind of thought he faded into the background

1948
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:47,232
Why I have a reason to believe that he was the reason that Alex did that

1949
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,536
Sort of the infomercial with jeunesse

1950
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
Because Alex

1951
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
And the Infowars brand

1952
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
The end up working

1953
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
Right

1954
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Communications Network debt

1955
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,264
Okay

1956
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,848
Speed of Alex's show you'll hear commercials where George Noory

1957
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,616
Promotes

1958
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,432
The Infowars Lyfe Genesis

1959
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,712
Life

1960
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,600
The George Noory from Coast to Coast AM

1961
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,160
Has cut a commercial for them that airs

1962
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
Seems to be maybe the

1963
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,512
The scam that Ted is on board

1964
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,048
Has more on the pier

1965
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,120
It seems like an MLM multi-level marketing age

1966
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
Is there

1967
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,424
You got another thing cooking

1968
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
It's a little bit of a sweet

1969
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:33,056
Steaks I would you like to hit the range tomorrow with a brand new gun

1970
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:38,688
Because the United States Concealed Carry Association wants to give you a free gun right now

1971
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,480
Completely free

1972
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:46,880
The uscca is here to give every responsibly Armed American the education train

1973
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,952
Legal and financial protection they need

1974
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
And today they're giving you

1975
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
Not one

1976
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,352
But for free chances to win $1,000

1977
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,960
Simply text juicy on 287 to 22 to get entered now

1978
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:05,312
Can you get for free chances to win $1,000 for any gun you want

1979
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:10,432
I think they have to do that cuz it might be illegal to have a gun

1980
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,784
I don't think you're allowed to just give away gun

1981
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,600
You think about this

1982
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,392
Is this is

1983
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,672
22nd

1984
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,976
It tells me that Genesis communication

1985
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,024
Can't be a good financial position

1986
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:29,120
Because if they were why would Ted Anderson do this voice over himself

1987
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,960
No he's not

1988
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,032
That leads me to suspect you can't hire a voice-over actor

1989
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,104
Or I don't know I could see him thinking he was great

1990
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:43,968
See him being one of those like local car dealer guys is like

1991
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:49,344
Amazing on TV that can probably hear some sort of Music in the background

1992
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,976
The Fingerprints of an editor

1993
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,560
I don't know whatever the case it doesn't look good any sign up

1994
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,840
To win a gun

1995
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
$4,000

1996
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,776
I'm fine with the thousand dollars when you got to say I guess I guess just needs to be attractive

1997
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:11,104
Could have been prevented by concealed carry

1998
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,664
Targeted advertising

1999
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
So Alec

2000
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
What's comes back

2001
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
From break

2002
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:20,064
With a new gun

2003
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,160
We've not heard him talk about the news

2004
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,208
That broke about his section

2005
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
In the Sandy Hook

2006
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,536
$100,000 or so that

2007
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
He brought upon himself

2008
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,656
That was the day to get into that account

2009
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:39,008
So Alex decides here on the January 3rd episode where he is

2010
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
Ben

2011
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,360
Bulshit about Iran

2012
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,944
Like that's the version that's his version of wagging the dog.

2013
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
So

2014
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
Alex's

2015
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Emmett Idaho

2016
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:57,952
I hesitate to explain this ahead of time for fear that it might ruin

2017
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
Surprise

2018
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,048
But Alex's position on it is that

2019
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,840
There's a message media blitz

2020
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,376
About this story

2021
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,192
They're trying to present in people's minds that he lost

2022
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,472
The Sandy Hook lawsuit

2023
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,776
And that the CIA is behind

2024
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,080
Basically

2025
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,128
Disagree with all three of those but

2026
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,688
I think he's got a good movies

2027
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,504
And I haven't spend all the time on this

2028
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,648
I really need to make him into a special report tomorrow just on it

2029
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,768
They put me on every News Channel

2030
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,072
McHenry newspaper

2031
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:40,192
What

2032
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
I'm constantly

2033
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
They had me on

2034
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,624
From 9 at night until about 2 a.m.

2035
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,952
They drop the red Scrolls

2036
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:07,584
Sing Alex Jones found guilty of lying about Sandy Hook parents that's not even true

2037
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,192
The judge said I

2038
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:15,520
That's not accurate either like

2039
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:25,248
$7,000

2040
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
It's a joke

2041
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,208
That turns into Jones is guilty of the Sandy Hook

2042
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:39,840
Why would they do that at 11

2043
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,472
That have been the local paper that meant nothing was a blast year of this judge

2044
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,384
View

2045
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,480
Warriors

2046
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,136
Imagine deposition I asked you a question and you don't know

2047
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,096
Seven-year-old videos

2048
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,680
Violated the court order

2049
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,448
You have

2050
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,240
Go to school

2051
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,056
What is $1,000

2052
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,200
In the rain should have scored the first amendment

2053
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,992
Trump derangement syndrome

2054
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,184
Yes I paid people tell outrageous lies about me

2055
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:39,744
Why

2056
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
Amazing calls

2057
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,472
We really know we're talkin about

2058
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:55,616
I'm right about everything and that's why I say under oath that my show is mostly opinion and by emotion

2059
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,664
I can't allow my feelings

2060
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,224
The only thing that it attorney would say

2061
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,272
It would respond to with

2062
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:05,600
This is unbelievable I've never seen this before is Rob do

2063
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:12,256
Right that's the only thing that you could say otherwise everything else make perfect

2064
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:15,328
Like reviewing Alex's behavior in this case

2065
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,376
Unbelievable

2066
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,240
Barnes is going to work Barnes

2067
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,568
To take over this is unbelievable

2068
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
Payday

2069
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Keep disease

2070
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
That's unreal

2071
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
Yeah I mean

2072
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,480
What I find really into

2073
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:37,344
First thing is that like the news of his didn't break on New Year's Eve

2074
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
Clearly

2075
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,648
I'm guessing maybe he did

2076
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,184
The stories when they

2077
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:47,328
I just had no awareness I guess not I don't imagine that the ball was dropping and then recovering

2078
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Nada

2079
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
Is the narcissist

2080
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,008
And he's having a little bit of a breakdown about it

2081
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,312
In the middle of the show he really does

2082
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,152
I don't know I don't know what it is but

2083
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,432
He's convinced

2084
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
Let the CIA

2085
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,248
Is behind

2086
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,040
Pushing stories

2087
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,832
About him being sanctioned

2088
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,392
Now that is one possibility

2089
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:17,792
Another possibility is that people enjoy these kinds of short

2090
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:21,888
The people. You got yours

2091
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,496
I don't listen to that what confuses me is

2092
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
I really do think

2093
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:31,104
Fundamentally doesn't understand some of what's going

2094
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,688
With his own

2095
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,504
This is the only read the headline

2096
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,784
That's probably Fair

2097
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,600
MacGregor's like but there's some stuff he's lying about

2098
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,416
I really don't think you understand

2099
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,280
I know I really think you just doesn't

2100
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:55,168
Can't be explained to him what's wrong

2101
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,960
You can't say I don't know in a deposition

2102
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,312
Corporate representative

2103
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
Right

2104
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:06,176
Can't really give me a source as well I don't have to have sores that no

2105
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,712
You were required

2106
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,552
To provide your sources or you are violating me

2107
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,576
Court order

2108
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
The thing that I keep

2109
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,928
I keep bumping my head up again

2110
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Is

2111
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
I think it's

2112
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Impossible

2113
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,024
To discern whether or not

2114
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
You understand

2115
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,072
This or not

2116
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
Be some sort of

2117
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
Batalla venture

2118
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
Maybe but

2119
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,936
At this point I find it

2120
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,704
Tubi

2121
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,472
Opaque

2122
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
Yeah and

2123
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
It would just be guessing

2124
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,848
Is it it's a possibility that he doesn't.

2125
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:40,992
Understand what people are requiring with him lying about everything

2126
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,808
I think folks are going on

2127
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
We could be element

2128
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Anyway

2129
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,904
This leads to Alex

2130
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,952
Ranting about how great his show is

2131
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,256
Cuz they really know what's going on in the world

2132
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
And you know what it is

2133
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:58,912
Is evidenced by how great is callers are and hope they don't like him today and how popular

2134
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,960
They don't think of you

2135
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,544
Better than

2136
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
He's really got the thinkers

2137
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,152
Got the best gas

2138
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
You got the best crew for real

2139
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,016
Number one podcast

2140
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,040
2000

2141
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:21,696
Number one podcast 2019 Joe Rogan

2142
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:27,328
Number one in 2018 you didn't have me on

2143
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:33,728
So when Alex says that it's in the news that his appearance on Rogan was the top podcast in the world in 2019 he's being kind of a day

2144
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,520
It wasn't in the news

2145
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:41,152
He's referring to a blog post on National file which is a website run by his employee Tom pepper

2146
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,992
Edit it didn't

2147
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:48,832
In the article it says of Alex's second appearance on Rogan

2148
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:53,696
Quote the podcast is uncirculated over 16 million views on YouTube making it the most

2149
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,256
You podcast in the entire world in 2019

2150
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,560
Elon Musk episode of broken head

2151
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,840
Has 28 million views

2152
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,656
But In fairness that wasn't September 2018

2153
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
So doesn't count

2154
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,216
The 2019 tour

2155
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
Resume comparison

2156
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:11,104
Gordon Ramsay Shaq and Billy Elish has episodes of hot ones

2157
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,384
All have way more

2158
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,920
Ben Alec State on

2159
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:18,272
Billieeilish is sitting at 29 million views and Gordon

2160
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,808
49 million

2161
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,136
So I don't know I guess it comes down to what you call a podcast

2162
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:29,024
I'm sure there are other examples of shows that got way way more views and Alex on Rogan but I don't have the patience

2163
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:34,912
To come up with more examples

2164
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Because

2165
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:38,240
Now I have to watch all three episodes

2166
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
Cuz I'm fairly certain Shaq's has to

2167
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
To be the best one

2168
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,592
It's pretty good it has to be

2169
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:49,248
I think most recent one I don't really watch that as much as I used to I was really sharp for a while and then

2170
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
Guess by Guess Bass

2171
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,832
Stone Cold

2172
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,160
Steve Austin was on nebulon.

2173
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
Anyway

2174
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,744
The national file post

2175
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,768
It really is just

2176
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,792
An absurd Act

2177
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,608
If navel-gazing being carried out by an organization with

2178
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,888
Explicit ties to Alex

2179
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,656
Themself

2180
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,936
It's just a puppy

2181
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
Piece that really comes off looking

2182
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,520
Since it all that really covers

2183
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
How many people watched Alex on Rogan

2184
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,408
It also includes a graphic that Rogan put out that included

2185
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,944
The most liked and disliked

2186
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Episode

2187
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,552
So the year which the post comments on saying the Alex's appearances quote

2188
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
The most

2189
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,880
Joe Rogan Experience YouTube video of the year

2190
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:34,048
Of course the graphic also shows that Alex's episode is East 5th most dislikes right but the article doesn't

2191
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,352
Rub the good times

2192
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
It's not about press

2193
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,656
It's about all press

2194
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,448
If I'm being perfectly honest

2195
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:43,776
The entire post is just begging Rogan to rebook Alec

2196
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:50,944
The giveaway is a comment that Alex very generously provided this totally legitimate news Outlet

2197
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,272
He is not answering a lot of calls

2198
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Quote

2199
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,856
Speaking to the National file Jones saved

2200
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,416
That just shows how popular Liberty and freedom are

2201
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,464
The only question is will Alex Jones

2202
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
Be back in 2020

2203
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
Rebook me

2204
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,608
Right

2205
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,632
Ask desperate

2206
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,192
Also I don't trust the last line of this article

2207
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:17,312
The websites are often vague about releasing the total number of plays of individual

2208
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,336
Podcast episode

2209
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,152
National file was able to confirm that Alex Jones

2210
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,432
Returns was the most list

2211
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,480
Most downloaded Joe Rogan

2212
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,760
Experience podcast

2213
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Of all time

2214
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,320
Exactly the baker

2215
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,088
Confirm that

2216
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:32,160
The only person who gave comment for this story is Alex

2217
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:32,928
Himself

2218
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:36,256
So I'm guessing the baby he confirm that for him on background

2219
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
Because I just

2220
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,072
Cannot imagine Joe Rogan

2221
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,096
Giving this kind of

2222
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,120
Private business

2223
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,400
Detailer

2224
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,960
National file

2225
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Alex

2226
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:50,080
Texted him and he was like that was the most-watched ever right and Joe is like yeah sure whatever

2227
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,896
And then you confirm it with us we'll file done

2228
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,272
Put simply this

2229
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,320
Rampant narcissism in desperation

2230
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
Turn on full display

2231
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:05,952
Alex is feeling he's having a breakdown about this like in the middle of the episode

2232
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,232
Make no mistake about it

2233
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,280
You just start screaming about how you can't lie.

2234
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
People

2235
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,888
Freedom and even my obnoxious loudmouth

2236
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
Texan

2237
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,472
Because I'm real

2238
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:23,616
Obnoxious and all of it is endearing I know just like your obnoxious in season did is enduring

2239
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:26,944
Did you know what eats real folks there's nothing fake here

2240
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:33,856
You think I'm so damn real

2241
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:42,048
I totally real he says in control texting

2242
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
Eli's

2243
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
Author they can't stand that

2244
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,360
They can't scare me

2245
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
Probably

2246
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:12,000
Special reports I don't cut it in a broadcast I'm your calls but

2247
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,680
I think they're getting ready to kill me and I am only seven.

2248
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,872
They don't do that once I got something back to me

2249
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:30,944
Every

2250
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
New Station

2251
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
Country

2252
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
What does that mean

2253
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
100

2254
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,904
Randomly

2255
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,440
How did you check 100

2256
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:46,560
I need the folks running the show there fighting from the beer talkin CIA

2257
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,608
Highest level Brennan and

2258
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,888
They got a plan

2259
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:55,520
They're assassinating my character in my name I had a trying to kill me

2260
01:39:55,776 --> 01:40:01,920
Alex does this anytime there's like some bad brass his name before they

2261
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,224
Really

2262
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,504
Tired stuff

2263
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,296
He says this a lot like he has four

2264
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,064
For quite a while now

2265
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,856
But like it's really

2266
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,904
The level of like

2267
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,952
The way he's delivering this the

2268
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:19,584
The pressured speech the Mania to it I don't normally see

2269
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
That doesn't

2270
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,936
Strike me as meaning that he

2271
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
He feels it

2272
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,520
There's more of it

2273
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,336
Stream this to the performance of this narrative that he's used

2274
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,872
Many times in the past

2275
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
Yeah like whenever he was going through his custody

2276
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,992
He was saying that to all these stories about him

2277
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,064
It's all just a setup to make him look bad

2278
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
Trackitt just Kant

2279
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
Andover Andover

2280
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,392
This is Dorset

2281
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,184
This is Beth that's all this is

2282
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
Bully

2283
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,512
On display

2284
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,792
The CIA

2285
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,328
Planted stories

2286
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,352
About Alex

2287
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:59,008
Having to pay $100,000 for doing a bad job in the temposition being like really an affront

2288
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,056
To the court

2289
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,336
And they're doing that

2290
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,360
Because they're got a job

2291
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,128
John Brennan

2292
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,432
Has a false flag plan he's going to kill Alex

2293
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,480
This is this is childish it

2294
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,296
Right here this is the dis in the middle of an episode

2295
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,088
That is covering some

2296
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
Serious

2297
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
This is

2298
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,672
I would I would

2299
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,512
Venture to say anybody listening to this show like 8 if you take the

2300
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,584
The first let's say our so seriously Alex

2301
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
Getting into the

2302
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,912
The geopolitical seeing a truck made a bold move

2303
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,192
And then out of nowhere

2304
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:32,032
Just starts talking about at the cia's going to kill him and have a false flag

2305
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
Like really

2306
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
Step back and be like

2307
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:39,968
Is someone who is healthy I am pretty sure those are two things of equal historical board

2308
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,016
And

2309
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,552
Also you know

2310
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:47,648
They say in an infinite Universe all things are possible but

2311
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:52,000
A malignant narcissist admitting that he is at fault for his own

2312
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Demise

2313
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
Doesn't seem like one of the

2314
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,096
Well I mean his demise

2315
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
Predestined

2316
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,912
Okay you made in the rain

2317
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,936
Intimate with God

2318
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:05,312
It turns out well he's going to talk about it in the next like already we had a situation where it's like

2319
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,336
What you're saying is

2320
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,920
Is disturbing and now it takes on like an even more disturbing

2321
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Character

2322
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
Every newspaper

2323
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,808
It comes in

2324
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
They did that

2325
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,608
I'm not sure exactly what's going on but

2326
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,448
Do that when they overthrow your government

2327
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:46,272
It's not a pride thing it's a satisfaction thing of a job well done that well I really counted for something I really

2328
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,672
Or whatever you know

2329
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:56,000
I'm not a loser they don't win by killing me

2330
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,048
Whatever is I got plan but it seems bad

2331
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,912
I just thought I'd tell you that cuz I just got to tell you

2332
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,984
I'm not doing okay

2333
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
And up

2334
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,104
Whatever

2335
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,712
5 my life but

2336
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,016
It's nothing to me

2337
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Because

2338
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,344
Long time ago

2339
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,904
A lot of times and I said

2340
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:28,256
I want people to wake up

2341
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:32,096
And and I literally told me it was like after this for 20 years

2342
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
Going to trigger

2343
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,680
The whole movement

2344
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,752
Take down the globalist to do it

2345
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,080
So you sure you want that

2346
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,456
I've literally heard God's voice in my head

2347
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:49,504
No time you know what I mean it's like

2348
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,600
Okay you want that's because you're going to get really Torn to Pieces at the end of it

2349
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Really good

2350
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:00,000
Whatever it is but you know what

2351
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,120
This is a mess

2352
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,912
You talking to me are you talking to you buddy

2353
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:08,704
This is a mess

2354
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,544
That's what I thought that's an internal monologue somebody Haswell

2355
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,592
Sad looking out the window on a

2356
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
The bus

2357
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
I mean like

2358
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,224
You already have

2359
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:24,320
I got to be honest when I look at stuff like that the way I look

2360
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,624
Is presenting all this like the CIA is going to

2361
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,672
To kill me and do a false flag because I'm

2362
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
Going to write about everything and they hate

2363
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,512
How popular I am in

2364
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:39,168
I've made a deal with God literary review's ago that I was going to trigger the end of the globalist but I would be just

2365
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
Destroyed in the process of very reasonable

2366
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,008
I kind of feel like maybe

2367
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,544
He's going to fake his death

2368
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,592
I'm something like that

2369
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,896
I think he's thought about it

2370
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,200
I would be probably thought about it

2371
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:56,832
False flag attack and kill me is like

2372
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,440
Are you going to say I don't know

2373
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,840
I don't know it it makes me feel like I know that

2374
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,144
Probably a part of this is that I find Alex

2375
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,264
Pretty boring person make my mind sort of go off in directions of like

2376
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,336
What might he try it be trying to say

2377
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,664
Preparing the audience

2378
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,712
And it seems to me like this would be

2379
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,992
And the audience for you

2380
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,040
Someday to not be there

2381
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,624
Obviously the CIA John Brennan isn't planning to kill Alex

2382
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Ludacris

2383
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:36,256
But if I find a way to kill himself that would implicate John Brennan

2384
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:44,448
Yeah that's a cool right then I become an idea

2385
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Debbie Carroll

2386
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,264
I'm like some

2387
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,312
General murder

2388
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,104
So

2389
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
Alex has the

2390
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,408
Little bit of a breakdown

2391
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Where

2392
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,736
Is narcissism is really just running wild

2393
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,528
Disturbed

2394
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,344
But not nearly as disturbing as

2395
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,904
What happens when he sits down with one

2396
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Steve

2397
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:11,584
Jay's to know how course you're going to have Steve on his back in your orbit of course

2398
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,656
Some of the stuff he says about what I would have

2399
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,424
Expected

2400
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,728
Some of it I could not have expected

2401
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,008
In a billion years

2402
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:22,080
I'm the king of South America now

2403
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,128
Have a great day enjoy that that would be fun

2404
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,432
That would be fine so here's Alex just introducing

2405
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:32,832
Riding shotgun with us for this Tower is dr. Steve pieczenik you can be back on

2406
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:39,232
I really appreciate him

2407
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:47,424
I know a lot of history and just amazing how many things this guy has been involved in

2408
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,008
You didn't even read that

2409
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,104
I don't believe Alex read that more of it is I will I will say

2410
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
Not having Reddit

2411
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:01,760
It is amazing how many things he claims to have been part of

2412
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,296
Steve would be opposed

2413
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,576
To death

2414
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:08,928
Sure probably be in favor of it

2415
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:11,744
I also kind of figured he would be against

2416
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:12,768
War

2417
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,048
Actually with Ron

2418
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,608
Right that seems outside of what he

2419
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,704
I wasn't too surprised by his reaction

2420
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,056
The issues of going to war

2421
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,408
The problems that arose

2422
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:35,552
The Iran hostage Siege is 911 really has come to fruition right now

2423
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,880
I am for the assassination of soleimani

2424
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,184
Would have done it a little bit more elegantly

2425
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,488
I would have done.

2426
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,560
That's kind of what I would have expected though. The f***

2427
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:48,608
The response I expected

2428
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,632
Yeah

2429
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,656
Define but

2430
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
A little bit

2431
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,496
Little tacky the way this is Carrie.

2432
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,264
That's

2433
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:59,872
That's that's f****** b*******

2434
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,432
Spy version of Mark Wahlberg saying he would

2435
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,480
Stop 911 if he was on the play

2436
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:10,368
State that we do know that he was involved

2437
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:16,512
Was not done elegant inelegant

2438
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,840
So

2439
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,632
Great and it sends a message

2440
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,448
But Alex has been talkin about the sending a message

2441
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,264
Would you like North Korea and other heads of state

2442
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
Even more focused on how it's going to send a message

2443
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,592
Switch to the youth

2444
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:31,360
A-Rod

2445
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,296
One thing to do

2446
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:43,136
Let's play Double Deals in Iran against the US

2447
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,720
Is a message in North Korea on so many fronts Trump made the right move

2448
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:02,592
That was really wishing but we will help them delete

2449
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
So I'm not sure if

2450
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,664
Steve is just talkingshit

2451
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,712
But this is very reminiscent

2452
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,504
The lead-up to the Iraq War

2453
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:15,904
Coming out coming out of the mouths of people he hates liberators

2454
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:21,536
Has a terrible terrible dictator what get rid of him the people will come to us in plaka

2455
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:26,912
And say thank you America there's absolutely no way that the entire region will be screaming death to America

2456
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
Yeah

2457
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:33,824
So like even leaving aside the level of that stupid parallel like recent data assets and put out by Ron

2458
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,616
University of Maryland

2459
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:40,736
86% of our audience have unfavorable views of the United States

2460
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,552
Percent favorable views

2461
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,832
That low

2462
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:48,160
The favorable number has been steadily heading downwards

2463
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,208
The high of 31% in August

2464
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
2015

2465
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:54,048
And the unfavorable number has been similarly spikings

2466
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,584
Hello that's a month it's

2467
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,352
67 /

2468
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:00,704
I'm going to go with maybe something happened in

2469
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,520
2016 to 2017 that made that

2470
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,288
Opinion

2471
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,568
It's what it's

2472
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Yeah maybe

2473
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,128
Stephen Hawking absolution

2474
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,968
No matter how bad the router in a ranas it's absurd to imagine

2475
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,992
Particularly at

2476
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:19,648
Disappointed history after all we've been through that any country is going to be like the US is here deliver

2477
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:22,976
That's just not a response you should be selling to people because

2478
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
People around the world have been plenty of examples

2479
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:31,168
Things didn't quite go that way our boundaries

2480
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,728
Dino not a good not a good thing

2481
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,264
It's a strange

2482
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,336
Position for Steve to have because it's

2483
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,872
A lot of things that

2484
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Has been

2485
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,920
Rhetorical tempo

2486
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
For them over the years

2487
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,784
So Alex realizes as you stalking

2488
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:51,392
Steve that Richard haass of the cfra Council on Foreign Relations

2489
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,928
Has worn

2490
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,696
The Disco.

2491
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,256
Lead to war and Alex if he responds

2492
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,840
Money raised that article up on infowars.com

2493
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
Watson

2494
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:04,960
Singapore president says the world will be a Battlefield

2495
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,752
After iran-us relations

2496
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:10,080
911

2497
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,152
Richard and Hodge

2498
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:17,248
And they are really at the establishments trying to

2499
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:21,344
I thought they loved were so much

2500
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,648
They didn't make this call

2501
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,464
Like what just happened under pechenik

2502
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
Couple quick points to raise here

2503
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:34,144
First Alex says that Steve left the Council on Foreign Relations after 9/11 cuz he knew they were involved in the attack

2504
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,424
This is complete

2505
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,192
Bulshit

2506
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,984
Wildly irresponsible

2507
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,776
Steve not to correct Alex in Media

2508
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,360
And Steve's first interview with Alex from April 24th

2509
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,384
2002

2510
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:47,456
Alex asked Steve about being a member of the CFR

2511
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:51,040
He replies that it used to be an elite organization like 15

2512
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,576
20 years prior

2513
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:56,416
I haven't attended a meeting in well over a year or two because it's

2514
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,952
Become very much a rotary

2515
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,280
Club basically it's the same people returning saying the same thing

2516
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,328
And eventually I found it a very little help

2517
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,888
It was an organization basically designed not to

2518
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
To influence our directive

2519
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,728
Steve clearly was telling Alex

2520
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:13,824
He hasn't been to a CSR meeting in well over a year to and even if you take the most

2521
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,432
Conservative estimate of time that he's describing that would be pre 9/11

2522
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,968
So what hour to saying

2523
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
Is b*******

2524
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:23,296
Maybe it's b******* that Steve has sent a toll.

2525
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,832
Like some Alex doesn't realize it's

2526
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,880
The contradiction of Steve's original story

2527
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:30,464
Or maybe I was just making it up knowing that Steve probably won't correct it

2528
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,560
There's a bond of two Liars who are both totally aware that the other person is

2529
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,840
Is Justice full of s***

2530
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
As the other

2531
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,680
It's the safest relationship in the world

2532
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:43,008
Two people who know the other one could f*** the other guy

2533
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,384
Prisoner's dilemma here it's just two guys knowing where

2534
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:54,784
Second point maybe Alex thinks that all his globalist CFR Democrat enemies are all in favor of War

2535
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,088
Because that's the characterization he's imagined of

2536
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,416
And this characterization is not in line with reality

2537
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:04,768
Maybe sometimes you end up creating an enemy to fight but then the real world version

2538
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,072
But how you pretend they act

2539
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,120
And then you find yourself in this situation

2540
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:09,888
Drive to come up

2541
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,912
The conspiracy

2542
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,936
Why this present

2543
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,984
Cfre supposed to attack

2544
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,264
B.

2545
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
Lipstick

2546
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,200
Cartoonish sketches

2547
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
Nonsense

2548
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,808
He did not leave the CFR because

2549
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,112
911 and knowing they were

2550
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,928
You have a responsibility to correct Alex on that

2551
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,208
Because it's b*******

2552
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,768
It's totally wrong don't even know I can

2553
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,560
Confirm that he was even

2554
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:43,680
Confirm you believe I found his name in the membership roller

2555
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,960
I will believe that for sure

2556
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,264
Okay but that makes sense I mean

2557
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,544
Department of Fairfield

2558
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,104
He had a Consulting business and

2559
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,896
I know I'm sorry

2560
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,920
Tons of people in a

2561
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,688
It's not like

2562
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,224
Some sort of 100

2563
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,272
Two-person shadowy group

2564
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
Thousands of members

2565
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
I understand

2566
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,648
NXT assessment of it like being a rotary club or at like people make

2567
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:04,928
And stuff like that

2568
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
That's not too far off from an atom

2569
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:10,048
A lot of people I've heard talk about it

2570
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:10,816
No

2571
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:13,632
Steve does not refute Alex's

2572
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:15,424
They did 911 and that's why you left

2573
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,448
In fact

2574
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
He says

2575
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,496
I did lie

2576
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,776
Because of 911

2577
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,056
Which is not activated

2578
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:21,824
Now

2579
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,896
This clip also includes

2580
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,944
Steve saying something

2581
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
I find

2582
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,272
It's nonsense

2583
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,856
Not only because of 911

2584
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,624
Because it's

2585
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,416
Aesthetic organization

2586
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:40,768
Paramount aesthetic Jew

2587
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,048
Talks-a-lot

2588
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,096
Never served our country

2589
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:50,496
So why does Steve feel the need to call Steve ASA Paramount pathetic Jew

2590
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,336
Houses jewishness relevant to the conversation about the CFR at all

2591
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,688
I didn't bring this up before because Steve is Jewish himself and sometimes

2592
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,480
Hasn't felt this pronounced

2593
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,248
Does best

2594
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,784
Translate lyrics

2595
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,576
Pointing out people's jewishness

2596
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,136
Particularly when criticizing or insult

2597
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,464
I give it a pass but in this instance it

2598
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,488
Really glaring

2599
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,632
There's no reason to bring up whether or not the head of the CFR who your painting is a nefarious International cabal at

2600
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,960
There's no excuse for making

2601
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,496
Can get a compound insult

2602
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,776
Steve.

2603
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
Pathetic

2604
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
Jew

2605
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,104
I don't know what this means for say

2606
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,384
But it really worried me

2607
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
When I heard that

2608
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,176
That's not

2609
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,736
That's not good

2610
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,552
They are really done

2611
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,904
They're done saying the quiet is that like they're all in on saying the quiet part loud now

2612
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,488
It felt when I heard him say that I was like

2613
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,792
That that that was jarring

2614
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,888
I didn't expect to hear the hard J

2615
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,728
What is vociferously

2616
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:56,800
Yeah that was somebody was tearing into that

2617
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,872
Stay cover J right there

2618
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,920
So Alex and Steve decide to take some

2619
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,736
Calls and they get a call from a farmer in Virginia

2620
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,272
Who has a similar approach

2621
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,552
Or similar feeling

2622
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
Sort of

2623
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,136
To the caller who chastised Alex

2624
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,928
The beginning of oh okay good

2625
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,488
Okay good he has a year the sense that

2626
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:24,448
For you to be like no place like when there's the first Frost

2627
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:27,264
Droid the sun in order to make sure

2628
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,800
He is also

2629
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:31,872
He has a bad egg

2630
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,896
He is not

2631
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:39,296
As sort of grounded as that other color percentage

2632
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,344
He is not the same right

2633
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,648
This guy has a little bit of a worst Chris

2634
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,672
B

2635
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
Really sucks out

2636
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,024
Thirty-one-year-old bomber Virginia

2637
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
And

2638
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,328
Community

2639
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,120
Has really been hit hard

2640
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,400
In my lifetime

2641
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,216
Population has been replaced with

2642
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,752
Brown people that speak it

2643
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,776
Different language in me

2644
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,080
Family have died

2645
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,616
From heroin overdose

2646
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
Farms

2647
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,688
Throwing away

2648
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,296
We believe in Trump Beezy supposed to be America

2649
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
I believe in you and

2650
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
Brian right now

2651
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,160
Because

2652
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,512
Your Infowars stickers my truck I'll buy your product

2653
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,816
You really let me down

2654
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
With this whole situation

2655
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,728
Did you sound like a fool going in circles trying to cover for Israel

2656
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:30,752
And trying to make

2657
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,544
6 of all this when you know it's

2658
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,312
Not right

2659
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,592
And I love you Alice

2660
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,872
This isn't right

2661
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,176
You need to get on your hands and knees and

2662
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,456
You're all in

2663
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,992
And apologize

2664
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,528
This is nuts

2665
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,344
So I told you I was a bad boy

2666
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:52,000
Because he's yelling for his

2667
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:58,144
Really really doing all right there for a second I mean I was disappointed but that's the angle that it took but I

2668
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,192
Kind of should have known cuz the guy was saying

2669
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,752
Surrounded by brown people like

2670
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,800
Clearly

2671
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:09,152
Of course it'll be like you just work for the

2672
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
This isn't good

2673
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:11,968
But

2674
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,760
Alex is very sensitive to those swords

2675
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,528
Criticism

2676
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,064
Is there any reason

2677
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,600
Especially on a high-tension

2678
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,880
Today like this

2679
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,648
He has

2680
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,184
A bit of a

2681
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,280
Like it doesn't happen immediately but it's Frozen Four

2682
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,560
Complete Loop where he has to get

2683
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,584
Super defensive

2684
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,424
Absolute about in fact

2685
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,264
Every time every day

2686
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,800
Is a meteor

2687
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,592
Which I would say is also not good

2688
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Okay

2689
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:46,272
I'm fighting the fentanyl coming into the country and since I was from

2690
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,064
And

2691
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,672
Tater ship that just mowed down 600 their own people

2692
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:57,024
The communist China is a dictatorship million Muslims in concentration camps

2693
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:09,056
I don't want these wars

2694
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:11,616
My honest review

2695
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Dead

2696
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,368
Are one thing or the other

2697
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,648
We're trying to have a discussion

2698
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,184
Okay show show

2699
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,464
Wodify

2700
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,048
Why aren't you to get down on my knees oh my God are Steve pieczenik take on this

2701
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,584
Because what I've done

2702
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,888
That's not a good response

2703
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,424
Because no he

2704
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:40,288
The arguments that he has are we're fighting The Sentinel coming in but that's not all the opiate

2705
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:45,408
Much larger picture to it than just the Fentanyl

2706
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,456
Fentanyl is bronfman

2707
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:49,760
Absolutely

2708
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,784
It should be a part of the

2709
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,088
No secondarily

2710
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:53,856
The other thing is

2711
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,624
Ron has

2712
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,696
Dictators there's dictators over there in China as a dictator

2713
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,744
Response that I mean like

2714
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,024
In this

2715
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,304
Alex Jones

2716
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,096
Nationalism world

2717
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,656
The correct response is who cares

2718
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:08,960
In terms of

2719
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:12,800
Just strict nationalism yep your response

2720
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,080
My response

2721
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
That is not who cares

2722
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
But it should be

2723
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,152
Alex exact

2724
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,688
Yeah yeah

2725
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:23,808
It kind of should be you know why and and that's the other thing is that

2726
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
When your dad's know why he should get out of

2727
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,928
Maybe he doesn't like it

2728
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
Like I mean

2729
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:35,328
I disagree entirely with his collar but that's the problem when you have this

2730
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,864
America first

2731
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,888
Obsession

2732
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,656
This nationalist

2733
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:41,216
Focus becomes very difficult to

2734
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,264
Have a meaningful

2735
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,312
Understanding with people

2736
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,592
Sing to you why you should care

2737
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,872
Foreign affairs

2738
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:50,176
Why you should care about what's going on in other countries

2739
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:54,272
Because it does appear to be not nationalist doubt to the adherence

2740
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,856
Alex is trying to walk this line is like we have interest

2741
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,904
Elsweyr even if it is America first

2742
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
Evans College

2743
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:02,976
About it

2744
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,768
I am still bad

2745
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,560
That he thinks that I was just doing this cuz of Israel

2746
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,424
I was really

2747
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:14,752
Close to being able to like I feel bad for the

2748
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,776
For the caller ID

2749
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,568
Cuz he's very clearly

2750
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:21,408
Please call us to talk about this buyer's remorse

2751
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,688
Yeah

2752
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,224
How much money have all these stickers

2753
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:29,088
We got caught and I hate it

2754
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,392
You know it's fun when rich people

2755
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,440
Will get conned out of all their money cuz f*** them

2756
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,720
But this dude is just

2757
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:40,608
The Stooges live another the s*** life with the rest of us and he gives a racist farmer in Virginia

2758
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,144
It's too easy to

2759
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,936
It's too easy to con races farmers

2760
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,960
That's just a reality

2761
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,752
Steve has Summit

2762
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:48,032
Because Alex does go to get

2763
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:48,800
Steve's take on

2764
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,848
And I would say the Steve

2765
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:51,616
Devices

2766
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,640
Next to meaning

2767
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:01,344
With all due respect

2768
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:05,696
Is he has a problem I understand

2769
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,512
I moved to the South

2770
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,816
I move to Florida to Texas

2771
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:16,704
Northeast virginia-maryland New York California Virginia

2772
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,752
I'll be finished for Sim prediction

2773
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:21,056
Governors Court

2774
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:21,824
Sexual

2775
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,176
Michener's

2776
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:29,248
Do roses do anything else you can complain sir

2777
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:32,576
It's very simple

2778
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:36,160
Texas and we carry guns

2779
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,952
I think you'll be a happier man

2780
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:43,840
Blame Alex Jones don't blame Alex Jones

2781
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
Slowboy

2782
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
This is a

2783
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:47,680
Great example Steve

2784
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,472
Not addressing the issue

2785
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,776
Addressing the wrong issue

2786
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,544
We think it may be

2787
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,568
He's not a good hostage

2788
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:56,128
Negotiator

2789
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:59,456
Today the conversation and you'll see in this next clip the color is

2790
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:04,064
Not interested in that level at CoCo fuckyourself

2791
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,088
Soylent

2792
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:09,184
The beginning of the stuff Alex is trying to express that he feels like what happened was a measure

2793
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:11,488
Did Trump carry out

2794
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,024
And then there's a bit of a backlash

2795
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,560
The color cuz he kind of

2796
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,328
Ignores that

2797
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:17,632
Response to Steve telling him to move to the South

2798
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:21,472
I got really mad when front bomb that little chemical base in Syria

2799
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,080
The Hawks

2800
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:30,176
And to then make the enemies back off and it was a measured response

2801
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,456
Works really well

2802
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:37,856
Okay I'm not going to be happy

2803
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,928
Bad but but I don't understand how

2804
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,976
How how how you think

2805
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:46,560
Betraying you being pro-war I'm not telling Trump what to do

2806
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,864
Juicy

2807
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,192
With Steve because

2808
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:52,960
Steve

2809
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:57,056
Staying in Virginia because my family's been here since the 1700s

2810
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,336
I need a fight

2811
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:00,128
That's all there is to it

2812
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,016
This is an America first we got to get out of all this stuff

2813
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
Eight is Enough

2814
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,832
Alex and you know it is

2815
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:12,416
Geno's down

2816
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,232
Ron

2817
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:21,120
That will absolutely stabilized a lot of them and you won't have them

2818
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:33,664
So yeah we just need to install a populist leader in a run and that will settle everything

2819
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,688
Boggle

2820
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:35,968
This is Ludacris

2821
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:39,552
I mean like I disagree with the color

2822
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,832
The other caller

2823
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,600
That was like

2824
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:44,160
Well within the framework that Alex

2825
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,184
Is constructed

2826
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,208
That is

2827
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,744
The response you're supposed to have

2828
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,816
This caller is more true to what Alex has

2829
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,608
Presented at right

2830
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,424
Revere long time and so there is this dis

2831
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,448
Between

2832
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,752
What are the colors being like this

2833
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,288
This is what we were

2834
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,592
This was about this is what

2835
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:05,664
This is The Logical endpoint of

2836
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:07,200
This s***

2837
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:09,504
You are now no longer

2838
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,552
On board with what you have left

2839
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:12,320
The audio

2840
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,344
Yeah

2841
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,624
And that should be a big

2842
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:15,904
Warning sign

2843
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,184
You would think

2844
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,464
Instead he could

2845
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
Really mad

2846
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,072
It is it is

2847
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,352
Because it is a little bit like

2848
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:31,520
I don't think what we should do is switch to a socialist form of government based around economic safety

2849
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,336
For all of its people and not just focus on the few

2850
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:38,432
And that's because we need to stop is really like no

2851
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:43,808
I guess that's another business

2852
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,832
Conspiracy space

2853
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:47,136
Especially when so many of your narratives a ReliOn

2854
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,928
Anti-semitic s*** from history

2855
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:51,488
Like a ton of this stuff is going to appeal to

2856
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,768
The people who are like

2857
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,048
Not just

2858
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:58,144
Politically against some of the things with the government of Israel does

2859
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:01,216
They're going to have a much larger view of that

2860
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
Right

2861
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,776
Conspiracy space and that's Danger

2862
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,896
You'll end up running afoul of it eventually always will be turned on

2863
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,456
Yeah it's especially dangerous now because

2864
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,760
Of a certain listlessness

2865
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,040
You know

2866
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:18,880
On on the left of somebody who's very much

2867
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:25,536
Hey I'm anti-interventionist I'm anti I want if I want to follow new sources that give me this anti-interventionist

2868
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:29,376
Rhetoric that I like and it all sin it turns out that

2869
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,656
They're also at the

2870
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:32,704
The anti-interventionist are also not

2871
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:35,264
You know you just wandered in and now you're

2872
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,800
It's the same

2873
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:42,944
Ecofascism of overlapping URI

2874
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,480
New York you should not

2875
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,808
You should not make common cause

2876
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,880
The enemy of my enemy is not my friend

2877
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:53,952
2p fire keep an eye on

2878
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,488
Very careful about

2879
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,256
Is it is

2880
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,816
Probably going to be a bigger issue

2881
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,864
Forward

2882
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,144
Unless I mean

2883
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,680
There is a possibility

2884
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,496
Ron does not respond

2885
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,032
In some super provoke

2886
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:10,336
That is a possibility in all of

2887
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:13,920
And it seems unlikely possibly in the

2888
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,968
As we sit here right now

2889
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:17,248
It is a possibility

2890
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,784
In that case all of this

2891
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
Will be much less

2892
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:22,624
Pronounce less height

2893
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,648
But we'll see

2894
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,464
Anyway Alex wants the benefit of the doubt

2895
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,024
Listcawler and I don't think the color is having

2896
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,792
Any of that s***

2897
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:38,240
Doesn't it will start getting upset

2898
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:41,312
You got to give us a little bit

2899
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,920
No

2900
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:46,944
Listen stop

2901
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:00,768
You just called

2902
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,864
Nautical. But I am going

2903
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,144
To insist

2904
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,192
Give me the benefit of the doubt and when you

2905
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:10,752
Start responding and clearly or not I'm going to

2906
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,032
Talk over you and hang up

2907
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:16,128
So cool to have like a little bit of

2908
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:20,736
And stuff like that on the show when you're not really even engaging with it it doesn't

2909
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,760
It doesn't really

2910
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,528
Castform

2911
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:24,576
They go to commercial

2912
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,160
I may come back and Alex gives a very defensive rank

2913
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:28,928
About is

2914
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:30,976
And it's pretty standard stuff for him

2915
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:35,072
It's kind of along the lines of like everybody's upset with Israel that I always make

2916
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,096
Accuse me of

2917
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,632
Just because I do XYZ

2918
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:41,728
It's pretty standard stuff I don't find it notable it all goes on

2919
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:43,776
A bit

2920
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,824
I've heard it many times

2921
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,360
Only notable

2922
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,408
Because Steve

2923
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,176
Is there

2924
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,456
And their Sarno

2925
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:54,784
Make Steve start talking about some of his feelings

2926
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:55,808
That is real

2927
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:56,832
And

2928
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:00,160
We've already got a hard J from Steve I don't want to hear about Israel

2929
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,952
Oh boy

2930
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:07,072
About Judaism

2931
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,056
Is Biddy

2932
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:24,736
Israel

2933
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:31,136
1000

2934
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:34,208
Put them in prison

2935
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,584
Put them in prison

2936
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:45,472
I would say name names then

2937
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,800
Being alone forcement

2938
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,592
Capacity after 9/11

2939
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:52,128
Are you talking about

2940
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,688
F*** off now beyond that I don't want to put this

2941
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:56,992
Too bluntly so I'm just going to come out and say

2942
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,040
That Stephen Hawking

2943
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
The more worried I am

2944
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,648
I don't know too many people outside Holocaust denial communities

2945
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,928
Who talked about the Holocaust

2946
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,696
Is a myth

2947
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,768
I know that he's not saying that it didn't happen but what

2948
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
Gauging in here

2949
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:16,192
Very standard Behavior UT from more Savvy Holocaust deniers are revisionist

2950
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:20,800
The Holocaust didn't happen I'm just saying that they inflated the numbers to make it look

2951
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,824
Like it's worse

2952
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,616
Then it really was

2953
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,640
Look I'm against

2954
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,176
Any Holocaust but

2955
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,200
I'm also against

2956
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:28,224
Liars

2957
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,296
I don't recall this being part of Steve's character

2958
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,064
That we've seen

2959
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:35,136
On the show previously

2960
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,416
This really

2961
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,184
Really freaks

2962
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,952
Is it

2963
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:43,584
It is like that has this always been there or is this somehow he's even more radicalized than

2964
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:47,424
I think it's probably something in there but she hasn't come out

2965
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,776
I don't know I don't know it has to be something that he's felt

2966
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:56,384
For a while I can't imagine you being a new revelation

2967
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
How many

2968
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:04,064
People are suddenly you know if they I you used to be a Republican and then three years later we need we need a religious Bo

2969
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,904
We need to get f***** up

2970
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:10,464
I think calling the Holocaust a myth

2971
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:17,120
The state of Israel uses that's a weekend thing a lot of freshman college girls do that they go out

2972
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:19,680
Florida they spend the spring break Holocaust

2973
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:22,240
The method come back to get back to work so I'm on who

2974
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:28,640
Pretending to be such a geopolitical expert and Steve I don't feel like this could be a late career development

2975
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:29,920
Also

2976
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:35,552
How is it that how could you possibly Square the events of his earlier career in there that department

2977
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,088
With the ability

2978
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,624
To believe that

2979
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,904
The Holocaust didn't happen

2980
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:41,952
He's not

2981
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:42,976
Well he's not

2982
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,512
Becky's not on

2983
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,536
No

2984
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,560
So

2985
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
It gets worse

2986
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,120
I'll just say that

2987
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:51,424
History

2988
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,008
You going to be a fool

2989
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,384
Israel's Holocaust

2990
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:08,320
He said do you want three to four hundred thousand

2991
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:10,880
People in the camps he said no I'd rather have

2992
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,696
Steve playing a little fast and loose

2993
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,720
Details here

2994
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:18,560
There were many Jewish refugees were not allowed in during

2995
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:21,376
And after World War II

2996
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:22,144
Place

2997
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
It wasn't Israel

2998
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:25,216
Primarily because Israel

2999
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:26,240
Yeah

3000
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,360
At the time the area was the Mandate for Palestine or mandatory Palace

3001
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,152
It was run by the British

3002
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:35,968
The British government put in place restrictive immigration

3003
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:38,784
Policies in the form of paper of 90

3004
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,552
1839

3005
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,088
Which set of Maximum 50

3006
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,392
18000 immigrants who can enter the mandate

3007
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:44,160
Ear

3008
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,976
If you look back at that. With present-day eyes

3009
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:50,304
You would think that the countries of the world would immediately open their doors today

3010
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,352
These people were being systematically killed

3011
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,376
But that was not the

3012
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:59,264
There were very few countries that were willing to take in a vast number of refugees fleeing from Germany and Austria

3013
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,312
And this continued even after the war

3014
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,360
Hundreds of thousands of people who

3015
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:05,920
Just revived something Unthinkable we're putting

3016
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:06,944
These persons can

3017
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:09,248
Having nowhere to go and very few options

3018
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:10,784
Then

3019
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,832
In 1948 the state of Israel

3020
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,392
I'm in the first few years of rocks

3021
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,440
Emily 140,000 Holocaust

3022
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,976
Survivors immigrated there

3023
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,000
And we're late in

3024
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:23,328
David Ben-Gurion was the first prime minister of Israel

3025
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:27,424
Until its formation in 1948 he had no formal office in the

3026
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,960
Mandate for Palestine

3027
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:31,008
He was just a prominent figure in the Jewish

3028
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:31,776
Community there

3029
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:35,360
You have literally no authority to negotiate immigration deals with

3030
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,128
Aikman

3031
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,664
Who incidentally was living

3032
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,944
Hiding at that point is

3033
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,992
Before fleeing to Arjun

3034
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:45,344
What I'm saying is that there's no real point in history went Ben-Gurion an item

3035
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,392
Could have had a reason to negotiate

3036
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,160
Something like the

3037
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:52,768
I was trying to find places where this 300,000 number might come up

3038
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:56,864
Cuz you think they had to 300,000

3039
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,656
Rather have pigs inside

3040
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,192
I want to know me places I can

3041
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:04,288
Can find it at that number is an interview that Ben-Gurion dead in March 9th

3042
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
1960

3043
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,592
You published in the spring 90

3044
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,872
97 issue

3045
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:08,640
Of Israel

3046
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:09,408
Studies

3047
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,944
In it he says quote

3048
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,248
12 years ago the Jewish state was established

3049
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,320
First we took in 300,000 European Jews

3050
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,344
From the displaced person

3051
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:22,720
Basically opposite with Steve is saying that we we did

3052
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
Right

3053
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,560
I don't want to say that Steve is making this up

3054
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:28,096
But I kind of think Steve is making

3055
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:28,864
I do

3056
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,448
You can definitely make an argument that the nonacs

3057
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984
Has powers did not Step Up

3058
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,032
To help refugees who are in desperate need

3059
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:37,056
During World War II

3060
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:39,616
And that argument has been made by many scholars

3061
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,384
Like David Wimer

3062
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:42,432
In his book The abandonment of the Jews

3063
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:46,016
That's a fine discussion to have it honestly having that conversation

3064
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:47,808
You should really make someone like Alex or Steve

3065
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,600
Rethink their current positions on him

3066
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,368
Immigration

3067
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,160
What's not okay is what's

3068
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:56,256
Unless he can cite his Source on this alleged negotiation

3069
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,536
Between David Ben-Gurion

3070
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:58,304
Iseman

3071
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,096
But I have to assume is that just b*******

3072
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,888
It's designed to rewrite the event

3073
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:02,656
Holocaust

3074
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:03,936
There's a name for that

3075
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,472
I don't know

3076
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,264
Not good

3077
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,544
Steve starts

3078
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:13,664
Ranting about other a bunch of Jews in Hitler's Army really don't like Steve

3079
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:20,064
No I used he's really going back where I am at

3080
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,136
We've got a long way from Ron Paul that's for f****** s***

3081
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,416
I don't think that's

3082
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:29,280
Steve is a fun crazy anymore anyways is not go home and tell your mother

3083
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:31,328
Marantz a bit here

3084
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:36,704
Ironically guess who was the leader

3085
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,240
I'm taking away the Jews

3086
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:40,032
A man by the name of Hydra

3087
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,824
An Austrian Jew

3088
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:47,712
Like that

3089
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,760
Drew Adams

3090
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:51,552
Commander's I'm getting tired of this

3091
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:57,184
We're really a Rothschild and I've looked into it it's true

3092
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,208
So

3093
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:01,792
The idea that there were serving within the army of the Third Reich

3094
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:02,816
It's not like

3095
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,608
Controversial

3096
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:07,424
It's not something

3097
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:10,496
That you'd say a b

3098
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:18,176
Right now Steve sounds like he's auditioning for a role in the f******

3099
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,224
Supremacist

3100
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,272
It's a phenomenon that happens

3101
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:24,576
Your brain doesn't make sense

3102
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:28,928
You're not there in the contacts whatever you what's happened

3103
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:30,976
Steve blaming

3104
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,000
The Jews 4th

3105
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:34,304
It's coming out here which is not good

3106
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:37,120
I think you might have taken a real serious turn

3107
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:42,240
Maybe the past better to Able better able to hide this part of his beliefs cuz I

3108
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:44,288
I'm shocked by this is crazy

3109
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:50,688
Whatever the case is I'm primarily interested in that last clip and Alex's claimed that he's looked into it and then Hitler was a rough day

3110
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:51,712
Altru

3111
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:53,504
Wonder where he's looked into this

3112
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,808
Because it's absolutely 100%

3113
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:56,576
Bulshit

3114
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:58,880
Insecurities I definitely heard put forth by

3115
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,416
Barely neo-Nazi

3116
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,440
Recite

3117
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:04,768
Hitler's father died

3118
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:07,840
Hitler's father at Louis shekel Gruber

3119
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:10,912
Was born out of wedlock without a father on his baptism

3120
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:11,680
Registry

3121
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,704
Which makes his

3122
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,240
Parentage a open Quest

3123
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,264
Who is Hitler

3124
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,288
Grandfather

3125
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,616
However the theory that his father was a Rothschild

3126
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,896
And I stress

3127
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:26,016
All the rumor that is Mother Maria and shekel Gruber was

3128
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:26,784
Servant for some

3129
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,064
Unspecified time

3130
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,624
At the home of Baron Rothschild in Vienna

3131
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,672
There's no proof that you actually ever been

3132
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:36,256
Been a servant there there's no evidence that this timeline would match up even if she

3133
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:40,352
She had and there's no proof that Maria got pregnant by Baron Rothschild

3134
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,376
Birthday Adler's father

3135
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,656
Is this fantasy stuff

3136
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:46,240
And it was kind of tabloid rumor s*** in the 1930s

3137
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:48,288
Is not true and is just

3138
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,824
Continue this conspiracy.

3139
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:50,592
To the present day

3140
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:54,432
This story got a little bit of credibility after the Nuremberg

3141
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,200
Trials

3142
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:56,736
When Hitler's lawyer Hans

3143
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,296
Frank told the tale waiting to be home

3144
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:02,368
Use going to be Expo

3145
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,904
You wasn't the court-appointed

3146
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,952
Defense lawyer

3147
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:11,328
He was just born

3148
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,936
The Story Goes Hitler can find it confided in Frank

3149
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,984
That he was being blackmailed by his nephew

3150
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:21,056
That he was going to reveal that Hitler was

3151
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,616
So he enlisted Frank to look into

3152
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:24,640
To the accusation

3153
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:28,480
Frank said he found that Hitler's grandmother gave birth while work

3154
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,760
In the home of a Jewish

3155
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,040
Family in the City of Grand

3156
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,064
And I also

3157
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:35,648
This family was by the name of

3158
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:36,416
Frankenberger

3159
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:39,744
Frank claimed that the head of the household and paid child

3160
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,024
Support seborrhea for years

3161
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,048
Cuz he knew

3162
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:44,352
His son was the child's father

3163
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,120
Sure

3164
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:47,680
None of the story matches up with historical records.

3165
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,752
As historian Ian Kershaw points out in his book

3166
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,312
This would have been in the 80

3167
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:56,128
1830s but Jewish people weren't allowed to live in Cross

3168
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,152
Until the 8th

3169
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:57,920
60

3170
02:18:58,176 --> 02:19:00,992
So there wouldn't be any Jewish families of wealth living there at the time

3171
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,088
There was also no family name frankenberger living there at the time

3172
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:07,648
And the next closest thing was Frankenreiter

3173
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:08,928
But they weren't

3174
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:12,000
No serious person takes a story as being any

3175
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,024
Even close to accurate

3176
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,304
And this story

3177
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,840
Credibility

3178
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:21,472
Rothschild

3179
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,752
Rothschild

3180
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:23,776
Completely made up

3181
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:29,152
DNA test to show the Hitler probably did have some Jewish ancestry but that's not surprising

3182
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
Given

3183
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:30,944
The time.

3184
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,736
The geography of the area

3185
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,528
It doesn't prove anything close to what Alex's

3186
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:39,392
I've seen this argument presented in some Neo-Nazi leaning circles

3187
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:41,696
And that immediately doesn't quite make sense

3188
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:43,744
Are these guys supposed to love Hitler

3189
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,024
And some of them do

3190
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:46,560
Sure sure

3191
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:48,352
Best I can

3192
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:51,680
Well the best that I can make of this is that these people

3193
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:54,752
Not so much

3194
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:59,104
Right so believe that Hitler was secretly a Jew allows you to

3195
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,640
Anti-semitism

3196
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:05,248
While still having a handy reason to not feel so bad about the fact that Hitler lost WWII

3197
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,272
Yeah it was a setup

3198
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:08,832
So I think

3199
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:09,856
There is a certain

3200
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:13,184
Subsets of that community that scapegoat

3201
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,720
The loss of World War

3202
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:17,024
The fact that Hitler was a Rothschild secret Jewish

3203
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,304
Personality

3204
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:22,656
Just leaving all of us Noble White's down the path of destruction

3205
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
Bastard

3206
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,800
Super racist Blues

3207
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:32,896
And this is one of the handy ones that I've seen it

3208
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:35,712
This segment is flying off the f****** rails

3209
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:39,552
Into an episode where Alex just talk to me

3210
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,600
About how Trump is totally cool to go to war

3211
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:44,160
Steve shows up in this f****** thing turn Super

3212
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:44,928
Crypto not

3213
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:50,304
Yeah I did not see this one coming up all the things that I thought might have happened today Steve

3214
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:53,120
Pieczenik showing up and denying the Holocaust

3215
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:54,144
Not on the list

3216
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:55,936
Totally

3217
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:01,056
This is what I say

3218
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:01,824
I was like

3219
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,104
Okay Steven going to shop

3220
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:05,920
Still didn't see Holocaust denial,

3221
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:07,200
Still didn't see it coming

3222
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:11,040
Yeah that's pretty amazing to put it plainly Alex

3223
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:11,808
Control of his show

3224
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:14,112
And it's tearing ever closer to being like

3225
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,392
An out-and-out open

3226
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:16,672
Play anti-semitic program

3227
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,720
Is inability to screencast

3228
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:20,768
His unwillingness to break ties with Steve

3229
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:22,304
Vagina Kenny's underline big

3230
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,096
But he refuses to examine

3231
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:25,120
Really starting

3232
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,424
Come to a head and I find the result to be

3233
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,448
F****** ugly

3234
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:29,984
That's worth seeing

3235
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,776
The next clip

3236
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:33,056
Steve says that

3237
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:35,616
The Israel came up with the alai or the myth

3238
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:36,384
The Holocaust

3239
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,664
Austin 1965

3240
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
I didn't make this

3241
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:53,792
So they came up with the story of the hollow point

3242
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:57,376
You're doing this for Israel

3243
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:59,936
When they don't even know what they're talking about

3244
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:02,496
Meanwhile you're talking to somebody

3245
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,776
Who is

3246
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,080
Engaging in Holocaust revisionism

3247
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:09,408
And Alex is too self-absorbed in his feelings

3248
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,432
What about this caller say

3249
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,528
You can't even push back on this very clear

3250
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,320
Super disturbing shitz

3251
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,344
Coming out of Steve's mouth

3252
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:18,624
It's real bad

3253
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,392
It is

3254
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,160
Incredibly bad

3255
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:24,768
Yeah it's the one-two punch of somebody insinuating that he's working for Israel

3256
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,608
While somebody is saying that Israel is the worst thing in the

3257
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:31,424
Cuz he can't say he can't defend Israel

3258
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,472
We are looking like he's defending Israel

3259
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,496
Maybe Steve knows

3260
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:36,032
Exactly like that's a

3261
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,056
F******

3262
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,848
The show is like

3263
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,384
The show would benefit from

3264
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,200
You know I've never considered what it would be like to

3265
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:48,064
To run a half Nazi show before but now I feel like I really know you know like Red Ice

3266
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:50,112
It seems obvious you're just a nut

3267
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:52,928
You know I Fox News

3268
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:55,232
You're just pretending not to be a nut

3269
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:56,768
But here you're

3270
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:58,304
At pretending to both be

3271
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:00,352
And not be enough

3272
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:02,912
Yeah wild it's wrong

3273
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:04,448
You can see what a toilet

3274
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:08,288
Yeah I think Alex

3275
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:12,640
Hook got a f*** you up but you know what I mean straight shooting is really

3276
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:15,456
He's really busy

3277
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:23,136
The next clip Steve is talking about how he was there when they sold the gas to a Rihanna.

3278
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:24,416
But if you listen

3279
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,952
He gets the gas Rock

3280
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,256
And Alex correct them

3281
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:29,792
If he's really this

3282
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:32,608
Geopolitical expert Shirley get the right guy

3283
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:33,632
Hey we all make

3284
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:40,032
Like 29 the house

3285
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,312
Airgas

3286
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,336
Area

3287
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:44,128
I was there when they sent it

3288
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:46,944
Mustard gas

3289
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,320
We shan't mustard-gas now you know and your and you're

3290
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:56,160
I think anybody in the news is talked about that

3291
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:56,928
No

3292
02:23:57,184 --> 02:24:03,328
You think anybody in the news goes back to the Carter administration of the Reagan Administration of a Bushman

3293
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:06,912
But nevertheless

3294
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:13,056
For somebody in Virginia say oh I'm disappointed

3295
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:18,176
What happened

3296
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,200
Jamaican

3297
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:19,968
Better

3298
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:23,552
Do you think they're mad about this caller they're really mad

3299
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:26,112
Yeah really threw them for a f******

3300
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,136
Well because

3301
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,672
He's not confrontational he's just

3302
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:29,440
Disappointed in them

3303
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:30,720
Hey David

3304
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:32,512
It's that you don't hate look

3305
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:34,048
I'm not angry with you

3306
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:37,632
You know if you eat what I am is disappointed

3307
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,192
Yeah they don't like that

3308
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:46,848
No mirrors very scary you start revising the Holocaust history by accident

3309
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,384
I'm overwhelmed by what you see

3310
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,968
Oh my God it's a monster do s*** that's

3311
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:52,992
Migos net worth

3312
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,600
Spell Steven

3313
02:24:57,856 --> 02:24:58,624
Quite a showing

3314
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,648
I'm here

3315
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:03,488
He's going to come back on Owen Shroyer show

3316
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,536
I got highway I know I said this

3317
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:08,608
Just a second

3318
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,376
Brittany

3319
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,424
And if there are producers

3320
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,776
They are really like

3321
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,824
There are ways you cannot do

3322
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:19,360
And that would be planning

3323
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,432
Some sort of

3324
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,712
Qualifications

3325
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:27,552
Some pre interviews math

3326
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:32,160
Instead of just like well we get on whatever happens happens

3327
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:35,488
Figure which I'm very glad that we

3328
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:37,280
Don't have to have those pretty

3329
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:38,560
Dakshin meetings where it's like

3330
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:39,584
Should we have Onan.

3331
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,376
Not our problem

3332
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:44,192
Do we know if this person

3333
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:49,312
Yikes we didn't know that Carrie was a little bit of a

3334
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,872
So we didn't have her on that's true

3335
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:59,808
I guess the most unethical thing we did was talk to Larry Nichols

3336
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:00,576
Not stoked about him

3337
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:03,136
So Alex comes back after saying goodbye to

3338
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
And

3339
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:05,696
Claire's

3340
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,488
Again that his lawsuit

3341
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,256
News

3342
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:14,912
It was all people were talking about as the ball was dropping on New Year's

3343
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:16,960
I'm doing it

3344
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:22,336
Hook nose

3345
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,736
Unusual

3346
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:32,576
Who the hell is giving that order in in in in your view and what is that

3347
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:34,368
Science are you still talking

3348
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:36,160
Steve there I forgot that he was

3349
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:38,464
You still around Steve's like

3350
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:41,536
It's not really all that

3351
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:44,864
No but it's the Alex preoccupation with this being V image

3352
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:48,448
That I'm the most important thing to send me up to be killed or whatever

3353
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,728
Sawbones

3354
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:51,264
So Alex

3355
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,544
Now he says goodbye.

3356
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:55,616
Sure and he makes clear that

3357
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:56,896
He's Prince of Peace

3358
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,176
Mini introduced

3359
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:58,944
Another game

3360
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:07,136
Syrian girls really smart lighting

3361
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:10,208
Over the years what you want since she's been on

3362
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:11,488
I'm glad she's here

3363
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,072
And you can find her on Twitter at partisan girl

3364
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:17,120
Syrian girl

3365
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:23,776
World Pastor who she is I'll do a little bit of that does she have a name yeah she does I'm going to respect

3366
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:26,848
Actor given name

3367
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,640
And a very easily but just because she's

3368
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:30,688
He seems to like to go by Syrian girl I'm going to

3369
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:31,712
I respect works for that

3370
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:36,832
Siri girls are online commentator and wildly unhinged conspiracy theory

3371
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:43,232
He's going to Gaston Alex's show dating back many years but I haven't heard on the show in a really long time so the timing of her resurgence

3372
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:44,256
Pretty weird

3373
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:47,328
Is she somebody who's going to help

3374
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,864
Mollify critics and

3375
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,912
Say that it's cool that they bomb people

3376
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:52,192
I will see

3377
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:58,080
For years Alex has relied on interviews of Syrian girl that justifies believe the chemical attacks in Syria are false flag

3378
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:00,640
While the International Community has arrived at the

3379
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:02,432
Conclusion that Assad use these weapons

3380
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,456
Syrian girl is

3381
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,736
Decided that is not the case

3382
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:08,832
And the rebels attacked themselves in order to do the International Community into sporting

3383
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:10,368
Honestly I

3384
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:11,648
I think she's a horrible voice

3385
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:18,048
In this conspiracy ecosystem but I've never really found her all that particularly interesting the other times I've heard her on the show long

3386
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:18,816
In the past

3387
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,352
I think part of the reason

3388
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:23,936
Is The Chew doesn't seem to have any credentials to speak on any of the issues other than

3389
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:25,472
The fact that you was born into Mass

3390
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:28,800
Australia when she was very young

3391
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:32,384
And the fact that she was in the graduate program for chemistry

3392
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,152
But you never finish

3393
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,968
I'm not sure this will make sense but I

3394
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:42,112
Kind of always seen Syrian girl is more of an Alex Jones caller who got elevated to the status of having an alias

3395
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,928
Kind of like Zach yeah yeah I can see what you're saying

3396
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:47,744
That's the way they treat her like a cat

3397
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,280
I guess

3398
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:51,840
She has something going on

3399
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,888
Outside of in Fort Worth

3400
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,656
Was just an

3401
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:55,680
In-house production

3402
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:57,984
But I in the past I've never really

3403
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:00,544
See her as anything else other than someone who just

3404
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,080
It comes on and says things are false

3405
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:04,384
Could you play ball

3406
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:06,176
Yeah

3407
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:09,504
Primary area of importance on Alex's shows today

3408
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,064
Deny that Assad had anything to do with war crimes

3409
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,344
She's on the show today

3410
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,672
Probably because her you know she has

3411
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:19,744
Her support of Assad it goes hand-in-hand with Hezbollah

3412
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:25,120
Since they're fighting for Assad in Syria intern is in a roni and black militia

3413
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:29,472
Trickle down to a sport

3414
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:32,544
So there is like a weird dynamic at play here even though she

3415
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,592
Syrian girl

3416
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:37,920
Intersection where that support

3417
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:44,064
And that's being on the side of the the the Syrian Army and I

3418
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:45,088
Come into play with it

3419
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,112
The issue that

3420
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:47,904
Hexiron

3421
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:50,464
I answer it's not an unbiased party

3422
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:52,768
At all real

3423
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,072
But she's against

3424
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:57,120
Wagner on goodbye

3425
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:59,168
Oh no

3426
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:05,824
If you show me all because the Holocaust didn't happen to know is that if you show your work there it is

3427
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,104
Conclusion is a little bit different

3428
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,152
Right so she comes on and

3429
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:11,712
And she says that this is like 2003 all over

3430
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:12,992
Right

3431
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:14,016
Fair enough

3432
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,624
Pictures of Mick also a pretty decent point in the fact that like

3433
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:21,184
In 2003 there were allies

3434
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:24,768
You're not there where the Kurds there were other allies on the ground

3435
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:26,048
That's a

3436
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,120
Made the situation not nearly as bad as it could have been right

3437
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:31,680
Now the prospect of having another War

3438
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:35,264
Probably not they're not have that makes the situation worse

3439
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:36,544
So I think she is

3440
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,336
The kernel of a decent point there

3441
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,616
And then she just talked

3442
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:48,832
2020s

3443
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:50,368
No

3444
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:03,168
And who is

3445
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:05,216
Supportive

3446
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,520
Nancy Pelosi

3447
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:08,800
It was needed

3448
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:12,384
I mean this woman her father actually was one of the

3449
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,664
Founders of Israel

3450
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:17,504
The original terrorist organizations

3451
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:18,528
That was

3452
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:21,856
Before Israel was created

3453
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:25,184
Organization by the British

3454
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:39,520
Really

3455
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:43,104
Convincing me because

3456
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:49,504
Because you're dumb you are very dumb certain Nancy Pelosi's father was named Thomas d'alesandro Jr and he

3457
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:52,320
He was not one of the founders of Israel member of a terrorist

3458
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:59,232
He was on the Baltimore City Council from 1935 to 1938 and member of the House of Representatives for 1930 929

3459
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:00,000
1947

3460
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:03,840
And then the mayor of Baltimore from 1947 to 1959

3461
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:09,984
So unless he was the mayor and Moonlighting halfway across the world sister city of Baltimore

3462
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:12,800
That's right Jerusalem day on crack

3463
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:16,896
What is true is that delasandro was a very vocal supporter of finding

3464
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:18,688
Place for the displaced Jewish population

3465
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:19,456
To be taken in

3466
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:21,760
Odds with the policies of his

3467
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:22,784
FDR

3468
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:27,136
Is it at that point

3469
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:29,952
Certainly not what d'alesandro

3470
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:35,840
Still Thunder opposed British control over the Mandate for Palestine and he lobbied for the United States

3471
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:36,864
Prioritize saving

3472
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:37,632
Choose

3473
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,912
He was instrumental in helping

3474
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:42,496
Can get the war Refugee board established which I helped rescue effort

3475
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:46,592
Alessandra was a proponent of the creation of Israel by the time that was happen

3476
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:48,640
He wasn't even in Congress anymore haven't

3477
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:49,920
Become the mayor of Baltimore

3478
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:52,736
The weather is fair to say that he was into the formation

3479
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:54,016
Israel

3480
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:55,552
Much to say that he was a sound

3481
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:58,368
Yeah he wasn't involved in any terrorist group

3482
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:02,208
He was potentially connected to the mafia though through a friend of his

3483
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,512
Which derailed his attempts to get reelected

3484
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:07,328
Is Mayor but I hardly think that's what Syrian girl is talking

3485
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:08,864
I don't I don't think she's

3486
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,144
I don't think she's doing

3487
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:11,424
Tonight in that anger

3488
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:12,448
More important

3489
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:15,520
Kind of get a sense here the level of s*** that Syrian girl bring

3490
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,288
To the table

3491
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:18,080
Vig misleading accusation

3492
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:19,872
Things about one political figure being used

3493
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:20,640
Justify

3494
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:21,920
Ridiculous conspiracy

3495
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:22,944
Theory like

3496
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,480
Nancy Pelosi wanted to

3497
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:25,760
Impeach Trump should be forced

3498
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,344
It's a family bad thinking but ultimately

3499
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:34,976
It's also meant to imply that it is Israel that's the reason to close he does this stuff in the first place

3500
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,000
Kind of

3501
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:38,048
Now that's what this boils down to which is

3502
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:40,352
Again the same mentality that is

3503
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:41,632
Not good on the

3504
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,936
You know it can be funny

3505
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:45,216
I can be funny

3506
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,008
These kinds of

3507
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,800
Ridiculous Wild

3508
02:33:49,312 --> 02:33:49,824
Stupid thing

3509
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:52,128
Whatever on the on the

3510
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:56,224
I am in Woodward on the precipice of a

3511
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:56,992
F******

3512
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:58,272
Potentially

3513
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,320
What do you even

3514
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,088
Call it

3515
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:05,440
Possible tensions are high you know that kind of situation to then do everything

3516
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:06,208
Impossible

3517
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:07,744
To avoid

3518
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,024
Giving any

3519
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,304
Blame

3520
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,840
False

3521
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:13,120
To the guy who is

3522
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:14,144
Crowing about it

3523
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:17,216
As though it was the biggest victory in the world

3524
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:21,824
It's so transparent and pathetic and sad but it's not funny

3525
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,848
Now it's just

3526
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:27,200
Tragic because some people

3527
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:33,856
Yeah the rationalizations for Trump extend even to the pool

3528
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,624
Point of

3529
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:39,744
Invalidating why you should be in power just even to make it to

3530
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,304
Defensive him you have to basically be like

3531
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:47,424
Did you hear what he's saying that's

3532
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:48,192
Here's what

3533
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:51,264
This episode of Glee was

3534
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,032
For the queen

3535
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:57,152
30 sent out threatening to attack cultural sites they don't have that

3536
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:59,456
In their body of information

3537
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:00,736
Yeah but still

3538
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:02,784
I think I think there's enough

3539
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,320
It's not even I would say

3540
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:06,112
Here is the excuse

3541
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:07,648
The Syrian girl gives

3542
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:08,672
In order to

3543
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:09,440
Not

3544
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,464
Really blame

3545
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,232
Trump

3546
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,000
Which is

3547
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,024
I would argue

3548
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,304
Dangerous and bad

3549
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:15,328
What do you think

3550
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,376
Don't think she's doing is my question

3551
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,400
Good question

3552
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:25,568
Think I'm

3553
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:32,736
This man is one of the most

3554
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:39,136
Most powerful he was the most popular and most horrible

3555
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,976
Moron reportedly

3556
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:47,584
Really was he we just killed the head of the Iranian government

3557
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:55,008
Something along those lines and so anyone in

3558
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:58,080
Any of the world's leaders

3559
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:01,152
I'm feeling personally on this trip

3560
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:08,576
So this is a pretty bad look for a propagandist

3561
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:11,392
Essentially the best angle they're coming up with is

3562
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:16,512
Someone told Trump soleimani was bad so he killed him not realizing the gravity of the yeah yes

3563
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:20,608
But basically boils down to sing the Trump is so unaware of the world so dumb

3564
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:22,400
So malleable and gullible

3565
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:26,752
Quick political assassinations without understanding the stakes of his act

3566
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:29,312
Just because someone told him it was a good idea

3567
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:31,360
Their defense seems to be the Trump as a

3568
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
The f****** idiot

3569
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,432
What shows how thin the soup is got

3570
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:38,272
Yeah yeah we've been telling you that from the beginning

3571
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:39,296
And it's

3572
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,368
Now that you agree with that somehow you think that's a good thing

3573
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,648
Not good

3574
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,696
This is how ineffectual the defense

3575
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,976
Has gotten in January

3576
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:50,304
I can't imagine how strained these people are going to be by the Alexa

3577
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:55,168
Moron who killed members of foreign governments that he totally shouldn't just

3578
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:55,936
Because I'm adult

3579
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:59,520
We got a boat for

3580
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:04,384
When Alex says the Ayatollah is a moron

3581
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,920
That's a reference to something

3582
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,944
Steve told him earlier

3583
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,968
The show in that interview

3584
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:12,064
Steve kept saying the back-in-the-day he'd been to the Ayatollah Khomeini house

3585
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:16,416
Negotiate the sun with stupid luck dealing with him

3586
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,184
Oh my God

3587
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,208
God

3588
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:21,024
That's what I was working on

3589
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:26,656
Great coolout grow up to be

3590
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:28,704
In some sort

3591
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,752
He needs to be an assist

3592
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,520
Student living home

3593
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:35,872
I think you need somebody to take care of his brain and keep your mouth shut

3594
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:37,920
Incarceration

3595
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:40,224
I would say the witness be happy.

3596
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:42,784
What happened

3597
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,832
Like he's a name that people need

3598
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:45,600
To know

3599
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:48,928
Yeah like people need to be more aware of the dangerous

3600
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:49,952
Insidious influence

3601
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:51,488
That. He is on the lot of

3602
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:55,072
And one of the problems that I think is so pronounced with him

3603
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:56,864
Is he is able to be a bit

3604
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,448
Chameleon like he's talking like this on Alex's show but I walked

3605
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:01,728
To Zone live streams

3606
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:04,032
Extreme that he does little video

3607
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:05,824
And they are a bit pretty different tone

3608
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:08,896
When he goes on other shows he has he adapt

3609
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:10,432
City environment that he's in

3610
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:13,248
Based on what would be appropriate

3611
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,784
There and that makes

3612
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:17,088
Particularly

3613
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,648
So

3614
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:22,720
Alex is talking to Siri and girl there in a great time

3615
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:24,768
Ham2 Alex wants

3616
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:25,792
Get to some calls

3617
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,840
Egypt pants

3618
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:33,728
I promise I'm going to get you one way or another I love you I appreciate you and I respect you and I apologize I've been gone to the other Carlos

3619
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:40,128
Josh your buddy I'm coming to you next with Syrian girl

3620
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:46,528
Real politics is not really complex it is complex

3621
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:48,576
Pleasant house Martin Grady's guest stars

3622
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:53,696
Steve was revising Holocaust history and I didn't even recognize it as it was happening

3623
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:56,256
Syrian girl that sings impeach him it was just a

3624
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:59,328
Set up to get Trump to attack Iran

3625
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,144
Trump is too stupid to know what he's doing

3626
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,424
Either not good guess

3627
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:06,496
Good politics is bananas

3628
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:07,776
So

3629
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:14,176
Syrian girl has presented the Trump was told that sulaimani was bad and he didn't know any better

3630
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:18,784
And now is I believe that something that The Intercept reported

3631
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,344
10 minutes later or so Alex is talking

3632
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,368
To her and you can

3633
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:24,672
Can see that this is a narrative that Alex is crafting

3634
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:28,768
But I do think they can just like Siri has bad guy

3635
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:31,328
He does all this public execution

3636
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,864
Hanging people and stuff

3637
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,680
And and Trump said well get that guy

3638
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,312
I'll do that

3639
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:45,920
So that's my view and you know you're also making that up

3640
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:50,016
I was just making that up you can see how this works

3641
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:52,064
Crazy

3642
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:52,832
Sounds good

3643
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:55,136
The Alex he has a flight of fancy

3644
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:56,416
Start imagining

3645
02:39:56,672 --> 02:39:57,184
Trump

3646
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:57,952
What he hopes

3647
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:01,280
Trump field

3648
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:04,096
Possibility of real thing that this is probably what happened

3649
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,120
Yeah it's it's

3650
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:05,888
Very dumb

3651
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:10,240
So what's your girl complains that Trump is surrounded by Swamp Thing

3652
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:12,288
Creatures of the swamp

3653
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:14,336
He is all of the swap

3654
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:16,640
Yes

3655
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:20,736
And then she gets into

3656
02:40:20,992 --> 02:40:22,016
Summerford

3657
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:23,808
Discussion

3658
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:24,832
But her position

3659
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:26,880
About chemical attack

3660
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:27,904
In Syria

3661
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:34,048
Is being surrounded rattly by mormor swampish

3662
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:00,928
Husband

3663
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:09,120
It actually has not been confirmed it to Facebook

3664
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:13,216
I guess that is not been

3665
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:13,984
Iproven

3666
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,776
Chemical weapons attack and tumor was

3667
02:41:17,568 --> 02:41:22,432
I kept that clip-in because it's one of the times that Syrian girl is more specific about the claims that she's making

3668
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:24,480
To deny Assad's involvement

3669
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:25,248
And chemical weapons

3670
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:27,808
Phone number Lisa vop

3671
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:29,856
Pcw the organization for the prohibition of

3672
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:30,624
Chemical weapons

3673
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,928
Their report about the attack

3674
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:36,000
Wikileaks release of documents from inside the investigation

3675
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:36,768
McKesson

3676
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:37,536
On their conclusion

3677
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:40,096
Including an email from a member of the sex binding

3678
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:41,632
Dissenting View

3679
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:43,680
And felt that his perspective was ignored

3680
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:45,216
An opcw report

3681
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:48,544
These documents are used to argue that there was a massive cover-up

3682
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:51,872
The opcw which Syrian girl and Alex are now transforming

3683
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:53,664
Proof this is a false flag

3684
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:55,200
But none of these leaps of logic

3685
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:56,992
Actually earned it anyway

3686
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:02,624
The opcw director-general Fernando areas came out and explain the quote

3687
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,440
The nature of any thorough inquiry for individuals in a

3688
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:07,744
Team Express subjective views

3689
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:11,072
While some of these diverse views continue to circulate in some Pub

3690
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,096
Book discussion forum

3691
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:14,400
I'd like to reiterate that I stand by the in

3692
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:15,424
Independent professional

3693
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,192
Conclusion

3694
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:20,288
I honestly feel like it would be almost more suspicious if there was absolutely no.

3695
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:26,944
Voices in an investigation like this operating from a predetermined conclusion

3696
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:29,248
Disinterested other possible explanation

3697
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:31,296
The presence of alternative

3698
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:33,088
The best I can tell is more evidence

3699
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:36,160
Did the conclusion arrived at in the report is the result of invest

3700
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:36,928
Navigation

3701
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:38,720
Counter hypotheses were there

3702
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:39,488
But the evidence

3703
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:41,792
Supported the sporting that were not good

3704
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,584
That's what it seems like to me

3705
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:48,192
Everybody knows that the most legitimate elections are 197 person

3706
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:52,288
Santa 3% everybody knows most legitimate form of

3707
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:53,312
Sure

3708
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:59,712
I've looked into this a little bit and like I said I'm not an expert from the credible information I can find disappears

3709
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:00,736
Pretty clearly not

3710
02:43:00,992 --> 02:43:01,504
To be a false

3711
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:03,552
I would say I find

3712
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:05,856
Very little compelling reason to believe

3713
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:08,160
When I weigh that again

3714
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:09,184
People were saying

3715
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,464
Is a false flag

3716
02:43:10,976 --> 02:43:12,000
Asad Malik

3717
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:13,792
Jones and the Russian government

3718
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:16,096
The picture of which side to air on I think

3719
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:18,144
Becomes a lot easier Tanger out

3720
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,448
I just don't

3721
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,240
I don't care for

3722
02:43:23,008 --> 02:43:23,776
I went hurricane

3723
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,800
Example for what

3724
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:27,616
Prove definitively this was a false flag

3725
02:43:27,872 --> 02:43:28,640
Is those open

3726
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:29,664
Bcw leaks

3727
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:30,944
They don't prove it

3728
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:32,736
So if that's the

3729
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:35,552
The tripod you're saved at your camera on

3730
02:43:36,064 --> 02:43:39,392
You're not going to fall over and I lost track of that metaphor in the middle of it

3731
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:42,464
Don't worry about it it's not a good foundation

3732
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:46,816
Yeah narratives that you're trying to put forth

3733
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:48,352
It is

3734
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:49,888
I don't know

3735
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,472
Let me I guess I guess I want to put

3736
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:55,008
Somehow this way

3737
02:43:55,776 --> 02:43:57,056
And it seems

3738
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,592
Edible to me but I feel like

3739
02:43:59,104 --> 02:44:01,152
To a certain extent up until

3740
02:44:01,408 --> 02:44:02,432
I recently

3741
02:44:02,944 --> 02:44:03,456
Be

3742
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:07,808
Conspiracy theories but they spawn and the the fanciful

3743
02:44:08,064 --> 02:44:09,600
Possibilities that they threw out there

3744
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:11,392
Somehow seeing more

3745
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,184
Andaz

3746
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:15,488
The insanity around them has become

3747
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,536
Even more insane in order to just

3748
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:20,096
Fire now it's just turned into unicorns

3749
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:24,960
We might as well you know like we're in pure magic territory now

3750
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:28,288
You know it's true that conspiracy theories

3751
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:29,312
Used to have

3752
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:31,616
Is slowly getting smaller and smaller and Spa

3753
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:34,688
The political sphere you have the overt

3754
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:36,480
Open window

3755
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:39,552
And like what

3756
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:42,112
Where where is the topics of conversation

3757
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:43,136
Inappropriate

3758
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,952
Even the same way that is true these

3759
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:48,256
Except the wonkavator

3760
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:51,584
There is no tracker

3761
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,680
That's absolutely true

3762
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:59,008
What's required to push

3763
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:04,640
All these ideas that are are being discussed

3764
02:45:04,896 --> 02:45:05,664
You're so much more

3765
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:06,944
Yeah

3766
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:09,248
And there's no need to scare them with

3767
02:45:10,016 --> 02:45:15,136
What what is just no need when when Serta polite Society is having a conversation that's like

3768
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:15,904
Level

3769
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:16,928
0 crazy

3770
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,952
5 is 5

3771
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:19,744
When Society is up

3772
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,792
Five or ten you got to go 20

3773
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:23,840
Otherwise people like

3774
02:45:24,096 --> 02:45:26,656
Alex only thrive on the appearance that they know some

3775
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:27,680
Open secret right

3776
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:28,448
And

3777
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:29,984
Everything's crazy

3778
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:32,288
You got to come up with the crazy secret that you know

3779
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:35,104
Hence all of the everyone's a demon

3780
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:37,152
I want everyone's a vampire

3781
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:38,176
A gray

3782
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:41,248
Cool it's just escalation within the rhetoric

3783
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,040
And I don't think it can be us

3784
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:44,064
Gleipnir

3785
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:46,880
Not without a harsh crash

3786
02:45:47,648 --> 02:45:50,208
So it is next Cliff Alex uses a weird idiom

3787
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:51,488
Discuss a little bit

3788
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:53,024
Things to do with anything

3789
02:45:54,048 --> 02:45:58,400
And I promise you

3790
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,567
Carlos

3791
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:07,615
Tell her you're thinking about the ride shotgun

3792
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:08,895
No

3793
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:10,943
Hairless bear

3794
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:13,759
I've never heard that before in my entire

3795
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:15,807
Cuz it's not express

3796
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:17,599
Complaining to be stalking about how like

3797
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:18,623
I'm going to get to call

3798
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:20,671
Alex was looking

3799
02:46:20,927 --> 02:46:25,791
He was looking for isn't here lips the admiral-general formulation of it is

3800
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:26,559
The governor

3801
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:30,655
That's an old southern expression which basically just means come hell or high water

3802
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,959
Yeah I'm going to do this even if it harelips the Jenner

3803
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:37,055
Making reference to people with cleft lips

3804
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:39,103
I think it's probably a pretty insensitive

3805
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:40,895
Expression that I don't think would be appropriate

3806
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:41,663
Use anymore

3807
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:45,759
I can't imagine that Alex is apologizing for that politically correct

3808
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:48,319
So that's a level of sensitivity that Alex is

3809
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:49,855
Far from

3810
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:51,135
Okay so then let's go to the

3811
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:52,415
The second part of the body

3812
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,975
If the water doesn't rise over bear

3813
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:57,023
Is not a popular expression

3814
02:46:57,279 --> 02:47:00,607
It's kind of a formulation of Lord willing and the creek doesn't rise

3815
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:06,751
Which is a slang term that there was actually uses a title for Spike Lee's 2010 documentary about the aftermath of hurricane

3816
02:47:07,007 --> 02:47:07,519
Trina

3817
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:10,079
The thing is though that those two idioms mean

3818
02:47:10,335 --> 02:47:11,103
Completely different thing

3819
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:16,223
The first is an expression that no matter what come hell or high water something is going to get done

3820
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:20,319
The second is an expression that says this thing is going to be done provided the

3821
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,599
The creek doesn't rise

3822
02:47:22,111 --> 02:47:23,391
By mixing these expression

3823
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:25,439
And Alex is basically saying that he's going to get to

3824
02:47:25,695 --> 02:47:27,999
Calls come hell or high water but not if there's high water

3825
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:29,023
Yes

3826
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:31,839
It's super weird

3827
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:33,631
It probably completely meaningless

3828
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:34,911
I honestly find us a

3829
02:47:35,167 --> 02:47:36,191
Conscious truth buried in there

3830
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:38,751
Just built to make

3831
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:40,287
Pronouncement about what

3832
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:44,895
Do do matter what will simultaneously baking and reasons why summer is never going to get done

3833
02:47:45,663 --> 02:47:47,711
Honestly this a accidentally

3834
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:49,247
I think it's pretty good ATM

3835
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,015
Describe Alex

3836
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:52,575
It reminds me so much of the Chobani lost

3837
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:58,207
Yeah where he was on are screaming goat I was going to win that case or die in the process and then he settled like a week later

3838
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:01,279
I'm not entirely sure what he thinks is Politically Incorrect about

3839
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:07,679
About it though I've no idea for you to throw out some sort of Reconstruction Era racial

3840
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:12,543
I thought you were over Edwards Creek is like I said we all know who Edward

3841
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:15,103
I thought that was what

3842
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:15,871
What I expect

3843
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:20,991
No and that you're you're absolutely right that is so weirdly

3844
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:23,551
Perfect that's so weirdly perfect

3845
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:26,367
It could not have leaked out more of that like

3846
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:30,463
Combination of even when I'm telling you something I am also

3847
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:34,559
It's 2

3848
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:35,327
Mouth

3849
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:38,655
So Alex Goes to call with Syrian girl and he gets

3850
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:39,679
The caller has

3851
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:40,703
Some very important

3852
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:42,495
He's going to calls with

3853
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:44,031
Syrian girl

3854
02:48:44,543 --> 02:48:45,311
With his list

3855
02:48:45,823 --> 02:48:48,383
Yes okay get a very important

3856
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:49,919
Very real

3857
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:53,503
Until I really wanted to let you know that there was another thing that I was more concerned

3858
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:55,551
About that I got window from some of my mileage

3859
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:56,831
Africa

3860
02:48:57,855 --> 02:48:59,903
Some of the fs alk2 back operatives

3861
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:03,999
Down in the app

3862
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:06,047
There's wind about them

3863
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:08,095
Ebola and trying to use it

3864
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:10,911
Listen

3865
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:16,543
Don't don't

3866
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:23,711
That's amazing it's amazing we're doing the bowl again guys

3867
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:26,527
Great running back to this weaponize Ebola

3868
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:30,367
Picadillo of Syrian girl at the past

3869
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:33,183
She is also disseminated narrative

3870
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:35,999
Man you just can't do that right now

3871
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:37,279
You just can't

3872
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:38,559
So that's where we're at

3873
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:39,839
I just call her

3874
02:49:40,095 --> 02:49:40,863
Either

3875
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:41,631
Express this

3876
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:42,911
Based on his Intel

3877
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:45,983
This dude

3878
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:51,871
Actually know a guy in Central South America I can't tell you what country is from his name or

3879
02:49:52,127 --> 02:49:54,687
General appearance or if he is a human being at all

3880
02:49:54,943 --> 02:49:56,223
But he does say that

3881
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:58,527
England is about to release the smallpox Bond

3882
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,295
On Bots

3883
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:05,695
I mean you can do it that invite like immediately

3884
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:09,279
So I'm Alex

3885
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:11,583
Takes this Anonymous caller

3886
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:18,239
You know pushing this b******* and you start to build ameredev office

3887
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:23,359
Again and

3888
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:28,223
Person brain and thousands a week to Texas alone

3889
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:31,295
Stopham federal judges let him go they go

3890
02:50:35,135 --> 02:50:36,671
California jury let him go they go

3891
02:50:42,303 --> 02:50:42,815
And

3892
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:47,423
So

3893
02:50:47,935 --> 02:50:49,983
The last isn't a war against America is

3894
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:53,055
The thought that precedes directly after his b*******

3895
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:57,919
Racist lie about being able to shoot white women in the back if you're in a grant

3896
02:50:58,175 --> 02:51:02,783
You see how all of this stuff is filtered and eventually comes down the drain

3897
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,319
And the drain

3898
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:06,111
Is white nationalism

3899
02:51:06,623 --> 02:51:07,135
It is

3900
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:08,927
This alacoque

3901
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:10,719
What are we going to do

3902
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:13,023
We're going to come up with a narrative about how l

3903
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:13,791
Tida

3904
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:14,815
Indices are going

3905
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:15,583
To Africa

3906
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:17,631
Get Ebola to attack us right

3907
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:19,679
That all that is in service

3908
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:21,471
Keeping non-white people out of the

3909
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:23,519
That's all that they're doing

3910
02:51:23,775 --> 02:51:25,823
I'm here that's that is the end result of

3911
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:27,103
The end goal

3912
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:29,151
Of this sort of rhetoric

3913
02:51:29,663 --> 02:51:30,687
Yeah

3914
02:51:31,967 --> 02:51:33,503
I will let Trump

3915
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:34,271
Do

3916
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:35,295
Anyting

3917
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:37,087
Because

3918
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:38,111
I think

3919
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:39,903
He is going to give me a white Chris

3920
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:42,975
.

3921
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:46,047
That's that's the mindset or get us closer

3922
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:46,815
Yeah

3923
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:50,655
So Alex another call and

3924
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:52,447
China

3925
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:53,471
Ron

3926
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:54,239
And the Bee

3927
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:56,543
Together

3928
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:57,311
Right

3929
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:59,359
No and that's what led to this attack

3930
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:02,943
But there's a reason

3931
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:06,271
Which has not come up on this show at all yet

3932
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:09,343
Well I mean I don't know

3933
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,623
And Alex is Intuit

3934
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:12,415
I was thinking the baby

3935
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:13,695
China

3936
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:14,719
Iran

3937
02:52:15,743 --> 02:52:16,767
Amazon

3938
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:18,303
Intertwine

3939
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:24,959
And trying to throw Trump off and make him look weak right before going into this first page of the trade deal

3940
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:25,727
Yes

3941
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:28,799
And maybe there's some more facets

3942
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:32,895
Get to the other colors of

3943
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:35,967
And this makes us stronger

3944
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:43,391
I think they were planning to manipulate this and get this a lot bigger butt

3945
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:45,951
Which is that it's an escalation

3946
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:46,975
Not good

3947
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:50,559
Do you have Alex they're getting this information

3948
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:55,167
From a caller who's like this was just to make him look bad for the trade deal

3949
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:55,935
Yes

3950
02:52:56,959 --> 02:52:57,471
Unreal

3951
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:59,007
Real

3952
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:04,639
Unreal speculation

3953
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:09,503
Good top five answers on the board guess what that's number one and there are no others

3954
02:53:09,759 --> 02:53:10,271
Depleted

3955
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:12,319
I'm boggled

3956
02:53:12,575 --> 02:53:14,111
So like this is been a really f***** up

3957
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:18,463
Situation here and

3958
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:19,231
It's a

3959
02:53:19,487 --> 02:53:22,047
Syrian girl is discussing how this is an escalation

3960
02:53:22,303 --> 02:53:22,815
You're killing

3961
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:25,119
Yes

3962
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:26,655
Is enacted escalation

3963
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,191
I think that you know

3964
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:30,751
All other things

3965
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:32,031
Being left aside

3966
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:32,799
Yes

3967
02:53:33,055 --> 02:53:34,079
You can't

3968
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:36,639
Really make it solid argument that it's not

3969
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,711
FairPoint or Fairplay

3970
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:42,015
I told you that she

3971
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:43,039
He used to be on

3972
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:45,087
And I haven't heard her on in a long time

3973
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:45,855
And

3974
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:47,135
I think there might have been a

3975
02:53:47,391 --> 02:53:49,695
Fallout between an Alex and her okay

3976
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:51,743
And I base that on how this

3977
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:55,327
Escalation

3978
02:53:59,167 --> 02:54:02,495
The Arab world and seen as a boogeyman

3979
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:07,615
Atlantic Monthly

3980
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:17,087
I don't know I don't know why you haven't in awhile

3981
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:25,535
Next week

3982
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:28,863
Your perspective on things very very thought-provoking

3983
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:30,399
Partisan girl on Twitter

3984
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:32,191
And we really appreciate you joining us thank you

3985
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:37,055
So someone told Syrian girl that Alex doesn't like having her on Atkins I mean

3986
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:39,615
Why would he say that unless

3987
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:40,639
He had heard that

3988
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:43,967
That from somebody something going on there

3989
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:47,295
Is Mystery I have no interest installment

3990
02:54:48,575 --> 02:54:51,903
Well I would tell you if he did he did give her the

3991
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:54,207
It reminded me of the Texans like

3992
02:54:54,463 --> 02:54:54,975
Bless your heart

3993
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:56,767
Like that that likes

3994
02:54:57,023 --> 02:55:02,143
I want to have you on weekly is the meeting is inverse which is I don't ever want to hear from you

3995
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:05,471
I disagree I think he does want to have her on regular late

3996
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:06,239
Because

3997
02:55:06,495 --> 02:55:08,287
She is an extension even

3998
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:09,311
Further of

3999
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:10,591
These old gas

4000
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:11,615
Coming back

4001
02:55:12,383 --> 02:55:12,895
The present is

4002
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:13,663
Being

4003
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:16,735
Invaded by these people who Alex is left

4004
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:17,759
Behind right

4005
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:20,831
Steve pieczenik is another example of that this show has

4006
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:23,135
Old-school Alex people on it

4007
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:27,999
Sometime well you have these old school people coming on

4008
02:55:28,255 --> 02:55:31,327
You have these old school colors were calling in expressing this

4009
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:32,863
Disappointment with Alex

4010
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:35,423
There is a real tension Brewing

4011
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:37,983
Bank in Infowars itself

4012
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:38,751
But I think it's

4013
02:55:40,031 --> 02:55:42,335
I don't I don't know what it's going to lead to and I just think

4014
02:55:43,103 --> 02:55:43,615
I mean

4015
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:46,943
If I if I had to sum anything up I'd say this shift sucks

4016
02:55:47,199 --> 02:55:48,479
It's a disaster

4017
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:52,063
His analysis of Iran in that situation is trash

4018
02:55:52,575 --> 02:55:53,087
Stupid

4019
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:56,671
He has no ability to push back on Steve saying

4020
02:55:56,927 --> 02:55:58,207
Wildly inappropriate

4021
02:55:58,463 --> 02:55:58,975
Inoffensive thing

4022
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:02,815
Syrian girl is probably someone who we should

4023
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:05,375
If he does end up coming back on the show at

4024
02:56:05,887 --> 02:56:06,399
We should look into

4025
02:56:06,655 --> 02:56:07,423
Do a lot more

4026
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:08,191
Deeply

4027
02:56:08,447 --> 02:56:09,215
Because I know that she has a

4028
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:09,983
Play pretty

4029
02:56:10,495 --> 02:56:12,799
F*****-up set of beliefs okay

4030
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:15,615
I just think that this

4031
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:16,383
Is

4032
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:17,919
Bad show

4033
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:20,735
I'll go one step further.

4034
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:22,783
Not only does this show suck

4035
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,063
But

4036
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:26,879
The world

4037
02:56:27,647 --> 02:56:33,791
The surrounding environment of the show so far

4038
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:37,119
I don't know I don't I don't know what

4039
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:39,679
What's going on I don't know what's going to happen but we will see

4040
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:46,591
Jordan website

4041
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:51,711
We already told her that doesn't score fighting at go to bed Jordan we are on Facebook and you can

4042
02:56:51,967 --> 02:56:56,575
Can download rcob go to iTunes podcast apps or whatever donate you

4043
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:59,135
Nothing to it all

4044
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:01,183
Until then

4045
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:02,463
I'm near

4046
02:57:02,719 --> 02:57:03,231
I'm Leo

4047
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:04,255
Dzx Clark

4048
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:05,791
I am the juiciest Ice Cube
