Your form of Sharon Kennedy

14
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
Candy is literally like

I picked out all the jellybeans I don't like it I gave the detective all the licorice one

All of the things that have been sent for sure Canada's pretty strong to

23
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,296
But in terms of the ones that I've had I've I think I act like I got to move to London

24
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Oh well reconstruct allowed to do different ship to American chocolate

God just a crunch

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
Cheese so good

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Nothing will ever beat the reefs

32
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Reese's peanut butter eggs

A secular society of Fairly decent-looking folks who spend their days eating babies worth

65
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Incubating heinous atrocities against culinary science

66
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Through their national dish

67
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Alright

68
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
Maybe accurate based on the negative chocolate-covered bugles

69
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
Anyway I'm not trying to be great. Thank you to all our International

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Sounds delicious

71
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
I really have a brain

72
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
Right spot so much as maybe a silver lining

73
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
As you know my aunt

74
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,799
Died earlier this year she did the the old Mortal coil

75
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Sure if you recall

76
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
Perry and Walter Payton

77
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,319
Okay I know I know the Joker Megan Superbowl shuffle right

78
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
So

79
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,415
D-Day as I call it was

80
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Was always her holiday like

81
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Chico signed

82
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
But when I went to college the first time

83
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Of my many John

84
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
My parents had terrible credit

85
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
The time

86
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
And she co-signed on my first student loan

87
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
And literally at that time she was like

88
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
And you're never going to miss

89
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
Today ever again are you

90
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
And yeah and the black male artist

91
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
That kind of thing is also deadly serious

92
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
The drawings of your hand as a turkey

93
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Exactly exactly

94
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
So yeah so

95
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
This is a rough is the first

96
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
The first one without her so it's a little bit rough but

97
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
I was reflecting on it

98
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
And

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
I think my silver lining is that

100
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
I have no regret

101
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Let's go there a lot of situations where you could lose a loved one and you regret something like I wish I had done this before

102
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
Before and all that stuff and I have no regrets

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Whatsoever

104
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,583
Maya and I I just had a solid relationship and I

105
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
I'm terribly sad that it's over but

106
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
A lot of people don't get that luxury of like her everything went

107
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Kum & Go I mean hey look

108
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,615
It's a bummer that you're talking about a loved one is no longer here

109
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,223
Pretty amazing thing to be able to feel that way

110
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
It really is that's about as uplifting as you can get when your tux

111
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,719
What's worse is oh because I didn't get to I didn't get the chance to say goodbye

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Tonight I was going to go see her and

113
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
Do that whole stuff she she died

114
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
But

115
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,471
I was even thinking about that was like I said regret that I didn't get to say goodbye

116
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
And then I was remembering when my grandfather died her dad

117
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,687
We were at the nursing home as it was just watching him he took him like a year to die

118
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
And she literally turn to me and she's like

119
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
I would rather die than let people see me like this

120
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
What up man

121
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
Turn out the door.

122
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Put on her head out to wet

123
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
She got her wish live the way she died

124
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Great

125
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
Well I've been Silver Lining Happy Thanksgiving

126
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:46,175
Celebrate Thanksgiving

127
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
The imagery around it is nice tan assertive

128
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Colonialist

129
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
Smith and all this complaints

130
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
About the holiday

131
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,767
But at the end of the day ultimately what it is about is if you wanted to be as about being grateful

132
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
I think that's certainly

133
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
If you take the time to reflect we have a lot to be grateful

134
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Before

135
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
And not just

136
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Weird

137
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Things you can

138
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Eat or drink from overseas

139
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
It's just great is his great-nephew a very wonderful

140
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Not being able to reflect on those things everybody

141
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Who is made

142
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
So many things for us to be grateful

143
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Yes we are we are very very grateful

144
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951

Sorry there's a

157
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
We're reporting this a little later than we normally do any pushback recording

158
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
And there's a very specific reason

159
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
And I think that you will immediately

160
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
We know what it is

161
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
And I would like for you to yell bingo

You have discovered why we were reportedly

165
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Alright okay

Listen to thicken a outdoor the show

187
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
When you can do that by going to a website

188
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
60 day you know a kind of thing you need

189
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
To do Auntie day be generous and care for the

190

Need to get

191
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Okay

192
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
I was going to start reciting the lyrics to all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight cuz there's a football holiday

193
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
Not really a football guy

194
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
No

195
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Cold

196
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Cold turkey

197
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,823
Okay turkey not good for

198
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,943
A couple of out of context drops

199
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
Which would you like to go for

200
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Okay

201
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Incorrect

202
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
I'll just start with this

203
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Made flight

204
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Okay that's how bad how bad that's good amount

205
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Apropos of nothing

206
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,871
Thinking of people get confused that he was talking about the Smurfs to make sure

207
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,223
Now I hear this is actually very exciting just makes out of contacts drop does not make

208
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
They had no place in the episode but it's very exciting

209
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Because it's something that I hope

210
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
So badly that Alex

211
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Continues by Celtic

212
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
5 unit 5 Miller mustaches

213
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Which Avenue

214
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Who singer

215
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Hitler mustache

216
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
I would love it

217
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
I think if you're on the scale at all

218
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
It's not great

219
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Way2go

220
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
22nd and Alex is still the Kong

221
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,839
Voter fraud powerful people who are on his side

222
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,703
Ladies and gentlemen the head of the Federal Election Commission

223
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,663
Against President Trump head against the American people

224
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Is

225
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Coming

226
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,855
The current head of the Federal Election Commission is a fella by the name of James Trainor

227
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
And he's a bit of a kook

228
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
Busy Council for

229
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,535
2016 campaign and it is nomination hearing

230
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,911
Would not commit to a blanket recusal from matters involving the president if he's confirmed the federal election

231
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
Commission I imagine prior to that he was a used car salesman

232
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Pretty cool stuff

233
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
Then you got to admire guy who says in their job interview they're straight-up not going to commit to doing their job

234
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Excuse me what the Constitution know

235
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,039
He was confirmed in May of this year after his nomination stalled in Congress for a few years

236
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
49430 Don Street

237
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Party lines

238
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
James Traynor is not a great dude

239
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
He made headlines earlier this year when he didn't interview with church millet

240
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Compare the 2020

241
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Listen to quotes spiritual warfare

242
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
He also claimed that religious leaders were tax

243
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Exemption feel free to tell their congregants who to vote for since Trump release an executive order indicating that he wasn't interested in enforcing

244
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Emily Johnson Amendment

245
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Trainer said quote

246
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
The Bishops are using their nonprofit

247
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,295
Status as a shield to hide behind from having to make a decision about who to support

248
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
And to come out publicly

249
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Bishop's we should have it

250
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Inform conscious when we go vote

251
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,023
But they never really take that next step and say gears who's meets the criteria oh boy

252
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
In that interview he also made clear that he believes that the separation of church and state is a quote

253
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Fallacy

254
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
He elaborated quote

255
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,055
It was John Adams it said the Constitution presupposes a Christian moral people

256
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,895
Which means you have to have that underlying principle in order for the Constitution

257
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
The function and work properly

258
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
What we see going on around the world is complete Anarchy in places where the rule of law has been completely abrogated

259
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,975
So it is a spiritual war that is striking at the underlying foundations of our constitutional republic

260
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
Getting rid of the Christian moral principles that are the basis

261
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
The foundation of a country

262
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
What important things

263
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,007
Point out is that John Adams and is 1798 letter said that quote our constitution

264
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
It was made only for a moral and religious

265
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Just people

266
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
It's wholly inadequate

267
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
To the government of any other

268
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Text James Traynor who's adding the word

269
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Christian

270
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
John Adams wasn't saying that the constitution was only for Christians

271
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
You just had a philosophy that morality itself relied on religion because that's an appealing shortcut to A procession

272
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
This quote is used and misused by Christian zealot

273
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
To argue that this is a fundamentally Christian country

274
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
And even somebody go on to

275
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,775
This suggests that the Constitution and the rights protected by it

276
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
These people are f*****-up dangerous cultist

277
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,943
That's fun to realize that they had of the Federal Election Commission is one such person

278
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Also two years prior to writing that letter

279
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,599
Adams have been part of signing the signing the Treaty of the AAA

280
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
Which was meant to establish commercial relations between the United States and Libya

281
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,815
Article 11 of that treaty presented by John Adams to be ratified by Congress begins quote

282
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion

283
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Weird

284
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
Trainers, the voter fraud came up in an interview with Newsmax

285
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,407
Where you was just complaining about the same stuff Trump's campaign is talking about in Pennsylvania

286
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,503
Where they believe that unless their pool water is get as close as possible to the vote counters

287
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Then there must be fraud going on

288
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
He said quote

289
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
I do believe there is voter fraud taking place in these places

290
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
Otherwise they would allow observations to go in

291
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
This is a pretty standard bulshit artist act

292
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
They can all just lay this out for you how this works on a very basic

293
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Sicklerville

294
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Here's how it starts

295
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
You allege that there's some problem going on

296
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
And if gays vote

297
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Speeding fraudulently count it

298
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,711
You have no proof that this is happening and it almost certainly is not happening but you need people to believe that it is

299
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,111
You insisted this is a major problem and then you propose a solution to this problem that you know will not be accepted

300
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,975
In this case it's the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania mandating howdy Philadelphia Board of Elections

301
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Carries out there Alexa

302
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
You know that your demand is going to be thrown out because the complaint is frivolous and the remedy would require the infringing of elope

303
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Kalady on its ability to run its own elect

304
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
It's certain to be reject

305
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
But that's good

306
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
You didn't want the complaint to be accepted anyway

307
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,431
If the complaint had been accepted them things don't change at all

308
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,807
The poll Watchers are a couple feet closer and you probably slow down the process or try to make a scene out of something

309
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
But it's not like you're going to find any actual fraud

310
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
What works so much better is it

311
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
The complaint being thrown out

312
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,583
Because then you get to go round it in system must be a cover-up going on or else your poll Watchers would be allowed to do basically the

313
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Counting themselves

314
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
You don't actually want the poll Watchers to get closer you want that requested be rejected so your surrogate

315
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
You can then create the appearance of Suspicion

316
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Everyone engaged in this knows exactly that this

317
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
This is the game

318
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
It's just outrageously tragic to see that someone

319
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
So transparently Craven

320
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,135
Could ever find themselves in the position of being the chair of Fe

321
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
DC is a real bummer

322
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
Yeah are you I mentioned it

323
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
At the very least some of these

324
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
I douchebag Republicans

325
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
In government must be like

326
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
You know when we hook

327
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
Our wagons

328
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
Insta Fox News 20 years ago

329
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
We thought we were going to be able to

330
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
The direct the mob

331
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
And we wouldn't allow them into power

332
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
But now the facc

333
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,527
Guy said we should start a holy war in the 15th century

334
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
I don't think that's okay

335
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
We got beat by Fox News

336
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,975
Even Charles Koch is going around saying who

337
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
Whoops my bad guys didn't mean to destroy democracy just

338
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,423
Wanted to make a s*** ton of money and kill people why is that wrong

339
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Whoops

340
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:55,871
Anyway Alex's straight-up he's a real cool guy and he wants you to know that if

341
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
F****** tell you

342
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
Would you tell you upfront

343
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Selection

344
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
Completely honest about it

345
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Make stuff up

346
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Hollister

347
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
The Sun the wrestler scumbags

348
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Lakeshore

349
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Sure it is

350
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
I would love to

351
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
CFA played out like

352
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
Months of him being like they're going to steal the election and then by Monday you know what I got to be honest I didn't steal this one

353
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,479
Can you imagine how long we spent listening to him safe

354
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,343
The only way is a fair election is if Trump wins for him to send me like guys

355
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
I got to be honest

356
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
This was a fair one I would be mad at him I got to be

357
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
I have nothing if I don't have my integrity

358
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,983
And I have to tell you I'm eating crow on this one.

359
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Iris.

360
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
If Rodger Stone just comes out now and he's like guys I

361
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
I did my research

362
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
This is a fair election

363
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Bikini block

364
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
That's what's so funny

365
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,559
Talking about that

366
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
But he did

367
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
Oh yeah

368
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
There is that you proved

369
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
The Supreme Court though

370
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
They may be making moves

371
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Okay in order to make sure the Trump actually does get in

372
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
Unprecedented

373
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Kman

374
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Change

375
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Key Battleground States

376
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
Supreme Court Justices were over what

377
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Who will be ruling on

378
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
What cases to take from a circuit

379
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
You will have control of those ruling

380
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
The FasTrak

381
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
But Gorsuch

382
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
And they put

383
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Thomas

384
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Barrett

385
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
They put a towel

386
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
And they put cabin all over

387
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Ford

388
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
So they are la

389
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
A major signal

390
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
They see the fraud

391
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
So there is a new Supreme Court justice so it's not at all surprising that there would be a new split of Circuit Court assignment

392
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
This is unprecedented

393
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
The f*** he's talking about

394
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
This is not

395
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Some weird thing where they you know this

396
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,544
This brim Court Justice rules over all of their assigned circuit

397
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
And as far as I can tell this is just been really

398
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,712
Overblown by people in the nonsense Alex Jones kind of world did she weigh

399
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Some kind of sign

400
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,368
There's an elaborate plan on folding a where it smells a lot like you and Archie

401
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
It's all very selective to like

402
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
You can say that Kavanaugh is over the six

403
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Circuit which include

404
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Michigan

405
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
Clarence Thomas's over the 11th

406
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Which includes Georgia

407
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
But for this to make sense you have to ignore certain facts

408
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
Like for instance part of Alex's stopping the steel tour 2020 was going to Arizona which is in the 9th circuit on

409
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Elena Kagan

410
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Weird

411
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
That's not part of his

412
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Block of trump lovers Arizona

413
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,320
So is the state that Alex really does need to

414
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
The flip in order to make his

415
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
Stuff work mathematically sure he pointed out

416
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,352
Listen to Samuel Alito

417
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Right

418
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,544
Look I don't know this is just silly it it seems like someone grasping at straws and I'm just not so into it

419
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,872
Which is also literally how they could have picked these judicial

420
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Circuit

421
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
I'm not interested in talking about this cuz there's bigger things

422
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Sure to go on

423
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Like to know what motivates

424
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:56,256
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris

425
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Joe Biden

426
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Because they want one thing status and money

427
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
I don't want to ride to thing

428
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Joe Biden Kamala are known as

429
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Put me on private jets

Mama Harris

438
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
And Joe Biden are about to release an album

439
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,096
Palliative

440
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
The Carter 3 what's happening right now

441
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Step

442
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
Little Joe Biden on the streets he's always just like oh yeah you want something give me a pallet

443
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
2 Chainz is president now

444
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:54,624
Tax rate of people individuals making over $500,000 a year I am fascinated

445
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,256
The streets Joe Biden and Kamala Harris private jet

446
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Really

447
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Really

448
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Really

449
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Really

450
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
That's pretty awesome

451
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
I do like I do like the just

452
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
That's just

453
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Throwing that out there way.

454
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,408
Why not just throw that out there yeah vitamin, Kamala Harris looking rappers

455
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,736
Extravagant

456
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:26,624
Cartoonish pictures of

457
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
So Alex gets a talking about these are these Trump suits that have been thrown out in in Pennsylvania

458
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
Something to say about this judge

459
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
And

460
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Money

461
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,472
Power Heaven are powerful

462
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
We're being lied to

463
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Obama judge

464
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
That we knew

465
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
What's going

466
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
Without even looking

467
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
The evidence

468
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
In Pennsylvania

469
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Lawyer said if what

470
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
I said

471
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,536
To be clear Alex and his audience may not know this but the president doesn't appoint state supreme court justices

472
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,144
38 states where is in 12 other states

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,752
Other methods are used epicly gubernatorial appointment or selection by the legislature

474
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,896
I guess the three states most relevant to Alex's hopes for a trump win our Pennsylvania Georgia and Michigan

475
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
And all three of them are states where the Supreme Court Justices are elect

476
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
There's no such thing as an Obama judge

477
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Johnny Supreme Court

478
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,952
Unless you just Define anyone who disagrees with you is an Obama judge it seems to be what Alex is doing

479
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Think about it

480
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
No s***

481
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
No not at all

482
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,144
Alex has also been using this visit Lestrange in

483
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Between place

484
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,520
And he seems to be on this Sunday episode this this November 22nd

485
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,360
Seems to be really leaning pretty hard into doomsday preaching

486
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
You're going to be at a point where cast

487
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
The children you know

488
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
By Age 5

489
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Dying

490
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
You're going to witness total extermination

491
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
Finally meet God

492
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
In your mind

493
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
Or you will get on your knees the state

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Will go through the fire

495
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
No one will escape

496
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,656
Not me not you not anybody

497
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
It's pretty harsh

498
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
There's a lot of Doom talk

499
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
Half of the five-year-old's I know or half of all five year old

500
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
I think everyone

501
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah not just

502
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
You not just Jordan

503
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
Cuz if I got to

504
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
To pick we'll see

505
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
I don't know any five-year-olds

506
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,464
I don't think I know anybody roll.

507
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
You know we're not going to have to deal with it

508
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
The plague of the firstborn

509
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Is not so bad if you don't have kids

510
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,032
Minute stuff cuz you still care about your neighbors or families short out

511
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,384
Oh yeah it's just very dark to be thinking that everybody's fuct

512
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,272
Bill Cooper's book was called behold apparel

513
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Pale Horse

514
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,600
And he starts talking about that Bible verse

515
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Looked and behold

516
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Ashen horse

517
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
And who sat upon his name was death

518
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Hades

519
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
A following with him

520
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Kill the sword

521
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Salmon

522
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Horse

523
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Who is the spiritual

524
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Valentino

525
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Now you see it

526
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Theater Willmar

527
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
Used to have the G7 he is

528
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
The last

529
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
The Gate of gates

530
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Executor

531
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
He will kill you and your family please.

532
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
You will die

533
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Wow

534
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Shadowgate

535
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,528
I want

536
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
A concrete

537
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Job for Bill Gates I feel like either he's constantly jockeying for and winning / losing position

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,096
I think Alex might be making up a lot of making it up

539
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,192
Because you wouldn't have time to readjust to those shift in position like

540
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
How often

541
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
Has been in

542
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
Jobs I've had internal changes in position different department

543
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,272
Groupon I was into a couple of different places

544
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
You lose about a week of productivity hourly

545
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
Get reactivated the new workflow the new responsibilities moved our manager to this team and this team is

546
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,632
Run a different way using Salesforce a different way the f*** is going on

547
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Yeah Bill Gates

548
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Could never be like a middleman and then

It's not about me

574
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
The resistance

575
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552

585
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Tablet

586
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
Yes

587
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
I don't believe that anybody called Alex

588
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,640
I don't believe it

589
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
I don't believe that people are talking about about

590
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
Even if all of that was true it still wouldn't matter

591
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,392
Because I imagine the real world version of

592
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,792
I feel like we will be more popular and Famous

593
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
Sooner or later someone would be good be like

00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,728

Tell the truth all right you're right like a clown demon

607
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480

608
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Don Rickles

Yahoo

Soap

611
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:37,376
Is the globalist

612
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
Don't have children

613
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,496
And I haven't heard him bring that up in a while cuz excited for it to come back

614
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Post

615
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
Human systems

616
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
I told somebody smokes after

617
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
All of them

618
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Metaphysical

619
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,208
Ancestors of the future is just like

620
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
Alex loves this talking point which is nonsense sooner like that the idea that the globalists have children

621
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,056
Who's the lead globalist in the US right now and Alex knows better than anyone that has at least one son so don't Can't Stop

622
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
Complaining about it

623
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
The Pale Horse is the globalist the top of the rotation

624
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
Actually horse

625
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,416
To have more than one person inside the horse costume that he still has one extra kid

626
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,744
Horse costume

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
I don't know about that

628
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:44,192
Klaus Schwab the head of the world economic Forum in the author of The Great reset that's another guy that Alex is really

629
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
Going on and on about these days

630
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
He has to

631
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
This is so dumb and Alex says it all the time not because it's true but because it underscores an important piece of his cosmology

632
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:59,552
There's something inherently suspicious or wrong about people who don't view reproducing the most important

633
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
Piece of light

634
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,392
This isn't about the globalist

635
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
Having kids or not having kids

636
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
He's literally a talking point

637
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Just to throw out

638
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,656
To make you feel like you need to have kids and there's nothing wrong if you don't

639
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
Probably like her

640
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Part of the grape

641
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Replacements

642
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
Bulshit that they all believe in where it's like

643
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Hayward

644
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
White people have to have more kids

645
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
It could be that kind

646
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,040
And if you could be adjacent to that believe all that s*** you know

647
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Might be

648
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
So Alex goes onto I talk about here how he's ready to die

649
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Ready to die February 4th

650
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
The truth

651
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
I think it's a

652
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,072
I'll leave it up to you to decide whether

653
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Ready to die

654
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Imprisoned

655
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
Because I realized I

656
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
I can't sign on

657
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
I'm not in the persecution I'm not into

658
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
Much as I going to get me

659
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Dip so short

660
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Jesus Christ

661
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
I wish we could have stopped this

662
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
We can't

663
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
We're going to get hurt

664
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Deserve

665
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:30,176
So again we're on this doom doom to appear on this this episode

666
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
I don't think I was sincere

667
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Really

668
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
But here's my thought here's what I want to discuss sure

669
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,672
Alex says he's like persecution fantasy or he's like William Wallace

670
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Like

671
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
Torture didn't like his last words afraid

672
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,192
I want to I want to ask you do you think of

673
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,032
He wants to make his I'd be willing to do anything for the

674
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
The truth

675
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,384
Would he be willing to live in obscurity and poverty

676
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,200
Oh absolutely for the truth

677
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,040
It's interesting to me to think about like well

678
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,344
Okay what if what if the truth

679
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
Required you to do a podcast out of your apartment

680
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
Would you do that Alex

681
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,656
All of this pretending about talking to world leaders in

682
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
Dinner party chatter about you

683
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Would you give up

684
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
The pretense of being the leader

685
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,872
A video of the Patriot movement Texas royalty

686
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
You give up all that for the truth

687
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
I don't think you would

688
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
You probably get tortured though because then

689
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,344
You know that's part of the persecution fantasy if you get to go out of martyr

690
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Well I mean it's

691
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
It's a lot more fun to think of

692
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Dying

693
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
Instead of

694
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Living with

695
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,120
Write it I would but I would much rather die for my beliefs than then

696
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Live like

697
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Really miserably forever

698
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah it's hard

699
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,336
It's a lot harder I don't think I'd be up for that

700
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
This thing you can do

701
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
It's not

702
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:09,760
So Alex talk to you about it's just like these are

703
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Hugging scary times

704
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
God's going to judge

705
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
I just get scared

706
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
And the men will be measured

707
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
And measures

708
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
We're all that we measure

709
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
The fire

710
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
I want them to find out

711
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Because it will cleanse.

712
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
Will do Annalise

713
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Separate the metal

714
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
But in that far

715
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
We will find our descendants

716
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
405 Construction

717
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
Real test is now

718
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
From here on out

719
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
What the f***

720
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,800
Is he going on about

721
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
If it look if the culture at large it gave it 6 months with a new Trump Administration Alexandra

722
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,856
Yeah burning witches is totally fine again of course when did it ever go wrong I just like to imagine something

723
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
People like hey man

724
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Yeah

725
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
I don't like

726
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,768
The Federal Reserve

727
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,352
Gradual weirdness intensifying you get to a point Relic

728
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,752
Yeah the cleansing fire tells me to come in fire

729
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
I'll be purifying and if you can't float well we know what's going on with you

730
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,968
That's like this

731
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
Trajectory Australian

732
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Reasonable place

733
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
A little bit of a kudo

734
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
Tip of the cap okay

735
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
In that he does a show

736
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,096
More weird than threatening I think

737
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,960
I'll just go to little bit longer to about 2 minutes

738
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,264
This is just Alex

739
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
Begging leftists to accept Jesus

740
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896

00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
I got an open heart open mind

742
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
You know that was a globalist

743
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
I would see you in

744
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
Sea ocean animals with trash

745
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Cool

746
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
God Spirit leads me

747
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Start thinking like that

748
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Easter sale

749
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048

750

Tell you straight up your face

751
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
If you are a Democrat

752
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
If you're allowed

753
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
If you are.

754
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
You're an idiot

Thousand Years these are blood drinkers

762
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
You are literally on your knees

763
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
To the seed of State

764
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352

789
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Except

790
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
To do it

791
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Much

792
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
This is such a serious

793
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
Situation

794
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Please

795
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Please turn back now

796
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Detroit

797
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
He wrote a book about it

798
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
You have to reject Satan

799
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
We don't have any

800
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
You must reject your body

801
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
So let me ask you

802
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,736
Yasin open-hearted lifted heard Alex Jones is please

803
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
Write this is a business they can do haha

804
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
How do you feel

805
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
Are you ready are you ready

806
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
To renounce

807
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Anthony fauci

808
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,976
I mean yeah

809
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,280
I really don't have a problem with that

810
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,352
I'll just pick somebody else who's very competent

811
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,216
I don't have any

812
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,360
Yeah I would like

813
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,943
It's certainly much less attachment then you have to someone like let's say print

814
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
Prince Philip

815
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,367
Desperately attached to I do find it I do find it hilarious

816
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
That he

817
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
Kind of correctly net he

818
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Let me let me put it this way

819
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
He embodies the point of drag

820
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Which is better

821
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,911
Foreigners are very weird and we should be terrified of that

822
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Prince Philip

823
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,311
That's what he said that's what I'm saying he's not from America

824
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
And in the same way you know Dracula was written to terrify people about the Eastern Bloc of Europe turnover in

825
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Into their home

826
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,527
Stealing their women and such

827
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
I guess I'm not that scared of her

828
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Filipino

829
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,767
Will you do the 23rd now and this episode opens with Alex

830
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,607
I would say accepting the Biden is going to win

831
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455
So how it is now

832
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,783
It's going to happen but it's the overthrow of the country or something

833
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:08,927
So we know that Alex has this thing that he talks about all the time which is operation lockstep

834
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
Which is what made up or

835
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:16,351
For the crib trauma meme or something about say 2010 document

836
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
Rockefeller Foundation

837
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
The what is a

838
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Is it called the

839
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,591
The future of technology and internet National development document

840
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,711
Operation lockstep

841
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
It almost got

842
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,575
Deeply deeply Exposed on Rogan's podcast price

843
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:41,695
Him I intend Ellen and Jamie were just not able to

844
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,279
Synthesize the information take it in well enough

845
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
To Rabbit Alex's Boynton

846
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
In real time

847
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,679
Something that Alex benefits from

848
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,727
To do a s*** job in f*** over everybody

849
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,847
Yes but also I think I said this on the

850
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:04,479
It's a complex thing that it would be very difficult to know nothing about it

851
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,807
I did do a bad job but I don't know if they come

852
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:13,439
Exactly I know I know full well I just wanted I just want to make that clear

853
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
Except in the places where it's

854
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Deserved

855
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Villages at snot one

856
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
That's not a fair credit

857
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Exactly

858
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Play the biggest problem

859
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,495
Before they even began they were outgunned and had no chance

860
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,823
I'm so Alex is now turning this into something else

861
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
This is now like lockstep

862
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
11

863
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Years ago

864
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
I put on Roblox jailbreak

865
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
It's since been taken off the internet

866
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Airplane collapse

867
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
I plan to

868
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Trigger

869
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
Collapse using virus

870
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
I knew that was and it just come out

871
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
In the

872
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
Haha

873
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:10,527
Operation lockstep is not a thing that is all just made up

874
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Alex did not know about the term lockstep when he made the film and the game but it's a very recent element of his conspiracy theories

875
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
That he's been trying to

876
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
Being part of his work all along

877
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
It absolutely 100% not true

878
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
Alex started bring up the word lockstep immediately after people like Jim Fetzer started misrepresenting that Rockefeller document

879
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,823
Scenarios for the future of technology and International Development

880
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
And meme started spreading

881
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
About those Miss representation

882
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,455
That's the actual basis for Alex's reporting

883
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,271
But let's entertain Alex's lie here though

884
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
Tease this out

885
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
He's claiming it in the updated version of endgame he knew all this stuff that was going to happen because he's read this imaginary

886
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Lockstep plant

887
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
That hadn't been written

888
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
That is a big bro

889
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,839
That is an issue

890
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,935
There's no such thing as a game 2.0 that's a bit of a problem

891
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,031
Alex's referring to endgame 1.5 which was this

892
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
Does the supplementary director's cut of endgame because 2007

893
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
The Rockefeller document that they luck

894
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
Except conspiracies based on wasn't written until 20

895
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
There's an issue

896
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,951
Was that we forgot that Alex's psychic

897
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
He can see the future

898
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
Dream

899
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
Keep forgetting about that timelines they'll be damned

900
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
You know it's really hard to fax them

901
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,703
Check somebody who can see into the future

902
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
That's an issue

903
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,031
Quite frankly

904
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,383
I'm going to the Second Sight I've been thinking about this for a while

905
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,663
I think I got a

906
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Just come out with it

907
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
I don't believe you psychic

908
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,575
I don't I don't I don't know how that's going to go boy Jordan

909
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,671
Leaving

910
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,975
I don't

911
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,535
And I can't I can't believe he is because

912
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,375
Dennis becomes a silly exercise

913
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,471
Not that this isn't silly to begin with all the ones that I

914
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Facetiously entertain

915
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
And even defense

916
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,591
That one I just never touch because

917
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
F****** I'm out

918
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Yeah I'm out when you say you're psychic

919
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,991
Yeah it's fun to think that he thinks he is

920
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,551
The other thing too that I want to point out about this

921
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,951
Is this is such a really good example of these things that Alex does where he tries to insert current things

922
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Into his past work

923
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,559
Like a lot of his work is so vague and so

924
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:36,959
You know it's in the documents in the white papers in all that I have the documents I can prove every

925
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Nothing's ever proven

926
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,591
Everything is so hyper nonspecific that like he complains about the Rock

927
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Rockefellers all the f****** time

928
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:49,503
And so yeah you can find tons of him talking with rocks I was trying to take over the world 10 years ago

929
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,831
Rockefeller evil

930
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
You did not know about a document that wouldn't

931
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
3 years later

932
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
When you made endgame

933
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
But it looks good now

934
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,327
It is it is unfortunate that part of the game

935
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,167
Of being so vague and tossing so much s*** at the wall

936
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Is if you want to say like

937
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Oh I knew about operation lockstep

938
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
11 years

939
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
And

940
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,127
And then tossed that s*** out you can be like

941
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,503
Okay well here's a clip of me saying that the Rockefellers are going to kill everybody and that it's in the white paper

942
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:26,111
The whitepaper I was referring to was the as heretofore yet Unwritten

943
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,767
You know that clip may exist and I found the like release

944
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Article

945
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
On Prison Planet

946
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
About the

947
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
The endgame 1.5

948
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
No mention of the Rockefellers isn't match

949
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,847
Block step none of this s*** has a big row just like a man we're going to have more interviews with big

950
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
Jim Unger

951
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
And Daniel estulin

952
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
Bilderberg

953
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Big Jim

954
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:59,391
Better

955
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,791
What is a giant panda or a really old chain-smoking anti-semite

956
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Take the chimp I will I will also take

957
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,423
Take the chip Alex's to talk

958
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,263
Plus Schwab a whole bunch

959
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,103
That is one particular thing that he says about him that

960
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
Is this worth saying

961
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Is not true

962
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:26,783
The populist movement across the world

963
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:33,183
Boris Johnson and he's got John Kerry

964
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
The covid-19 lockdown

965
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
Is a punishment

966
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
The populace to bring them under control and they admit

967
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
It's a social movement

968
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
Klaus Schwab says he's not a threat

969
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
Covid-19

970
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
All the all that's nonsense but it is worth pointing out also the Boris Johnson is now on the outs he is no longer the

971
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
Eroica populist today

972
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,575
Because I guess he's taking covid seriously eventually

973
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
You know

974
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
Now he's a globalist

975
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,695
Yeah unfortunately whenever you eventually like

976
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
Succumb to reality, everybody who's unreality does not like you anymore anybody who still committed to this

977
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
Yeah I will turn on you very attractive

978
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
Call Schwab thing in his book The Great reset the covid-19 is not a threat

979
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,943
Alex is doing this based on a cherry-picks quotation that reads quote

980
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,807
Unlike certain past pandemics covid-19 doesn't pose a new existential threat

981
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,207
This quote is taken out of context to imply that he's saying AB isn't really a threat and it's just being used take over Society Shore

982
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,023
You actually go to the text you'll find that the words quote

983
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
New existential threat

984
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
Have a

985
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,631
Specific meaning in the context of the writing

986
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,703
This was found after a discussion of the bubonic

987
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
Plague and the germs that were brought

988
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,055
To North America by the first European explorers

989
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,639
Which is why the word Anu is in that sense yeah there's that

990
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
Census of new X

991
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
Existential threat

992
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
What's the population

993
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,551
Covid-19 is dangerous and deadly but it's not the bubonic

994
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
Play again I don't think that's a controversial tape

995
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
Rob isn't saying the covid-19 not a threat

996
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Just that quote

997
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,535
Unless the pandemic evolves in an unforeseen way

998
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,375
It's not going to be something that poses an existential threat to the world like

999
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
The plague

1000
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,263
I want to take that quote out of context and giving it the context he wanted to have which isn't real

1001
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,871
Alexandra read this book and I would go so far as to say that his researchers probably haven't either

1002
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,967
I say this because of that quote is taken from the introduction to the text

1003
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:37,343
So I can see them finding that being not good enough

1004
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Subway

1005
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
I don't know if you've heard this

1006
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
Jordan

1007
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
I don't know if you heard this news

1008
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Did you hear that

1009
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
People talk about Alex identified I did not hear

1010
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Actually

1011
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,375
By the way

1012
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
Yolanda calls but I've gotten calls

1013
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
From some of the biggest people out there

1014
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Batman Alex

1015
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Incredible

1016
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,575
When I go to these dinner parties in New York in LA

1017
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Only one talk about is you

1018
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
What's it like to have everybody now accepting you a celebrating

1019
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
No people

1020
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Finally understand

1021
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,687
What's it like to have movies not a zero-sum your honor

1022
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:40,831
Traitor to call you up man you remember when I was right

1023
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,135
We really crusted in that movie

1024
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
Anyways Alex

1025
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,047
What is it like for James Woods to have commissioned a bronze sculpture of you and his front lawn

1026
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
Alex what is it like

1027
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
I got a call from the chair that Clint Eastwood talk to him talking to big people

1028
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
SMS sent me a video of him

1029
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,479
Saying that Alex is the leader of their movement

1030
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Well ad

1031
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,575
4info Warriors fatality

1032
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,231
Episode about that dude how many irrelevant

1033
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
I think we have

1034
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,863
Little punching laterally at the time that we did the coach

1035
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Text Dave though

1036
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
I think I got tricked

1037
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:34,079
By the fact that like rightwingwatch would that have post about himself

1038
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
I thought for sure this is somebody who is much more relevant than they are

1039
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:48,671
I don't understand why you were supposed to watch the right-wing use a right-wing voice

1040
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:55,071
He was somebody who had a bit more of an audience

1041
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,351
Expand

1042
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
You just like that dog

1043
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Looks like his dog

1044
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
Yeah I don't know I don't think that Alex is getting these calls like I said when he is very

1045
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Fixated on this end

1046
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,687
Interesting Lee as he's being

1047
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
People who are the most important

1048
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
In society the heads of state

1049
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
The media figures are

1050
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,927
Celebrities everybody just so happens

1051
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
That his every move is being watched

1052
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,511
By the feds

1053
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
You understand that

1054
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Followed home

1055
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Black SUVs

1056
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
Eden restaurant

1057
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
FBI and CIA

1058

Papillon CIA

1059
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,639
Next.

1060
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Have a good day mr. Jones

1061
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
CPAP masks

1062
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,783
Mission Impossible

1063
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Federal agents follow me

1064
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
What

1065
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Wow

1066
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,767
Wow

1067
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,935
Wow we're going for it but I really do love the idea of like some guy being

1068
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
Hey Alex

1069
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:10,591
I'm CIA murder

1070
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:16,991
I get like that I was I'm CIA my buddy here is as bi we are working on a joint test

1071
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,295
Force about your diet

1072
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
What the f*** is this

1073
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,951
I think I could drive and got could legitimately drive a real person

1074
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
And say it if so if

1075
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,535
People were actually doing that

1076
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,095
I think if people actually did that to Alex

1077
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,447
He would feel so validated well I'd like it would make him feel good

1078
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,287
I think if you're a paranoid narcissist who also has a modicum of celebrity

1079
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,103
You might have people who interact with you

1080
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Who are like Sands

1081
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:51,039
Sure or something sure I meant because your brain doesn't interpret information correctly like oh my God.

1082
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,343
Privacy is URI cuz they're wearing a mask

1083
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
It may be there in a suit yourself or a noticeable person yeah people turn and look whenever they

1084
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
They're in a restaurant in there like maybe one time you was coming home from work and there was a black van that happened to be tonight

1085
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
Black man is the

1086
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
Grow up man

1087
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,639
That would be that would be an easy I think that would be an easy situation that we should

1088
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,455
Nobody who's not in law enforcement

1089
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
Nobody was not a fed

1090
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Can have a black guy

1091
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,135
I think that's a new rule that way we can all identify all the time

1092
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,183
They would be against that

1093
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
You have to okay fine

1094
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,911
You have to pay me unicorn or a dragon

1095
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
On the side of your black van

1096
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
If you are not a fan

1097
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,031
I think we could reach this compromise

1098
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,615
This is real strange this is real

1099
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
Like he had this

1100
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,687
Doom and Gloom sort of like gods

1101
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:55,295
Cleansing fire is going to purify the world on Sunday

1102
00:56:55,551 --> 00:57:01,695
Now on Monday with these fantasies about how all the celebrities love

1103
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:07,327
Everybody is watching his every move at all of the alarm for Smith

1104
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
And then

1105
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
I got this news

1106
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:14,239
When you decide to spread the word on when you decide to share the info download it

1107
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,079
While

1108
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,943
27 years on air

1109
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Oh really

1110
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
How's the time

1111
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,767
Zebras

1112
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,815
Yes that is correct

1113
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
Hypothetical last episode I was like

1114
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Alright

1115
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
No matter what

1116
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
The 24th

1117
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,871
Is either going to be the day that he sets out to do his last episode

1118
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,271
It will be yet another time

1119
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,087
Your eyes

1120
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
And your joy

1121
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:06,463
Everytime it gets you up you have only to make you disappointed

1122
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
It is

1123
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,047
I will call after all these years

1124
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
Steele Creek

1125
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,519
Could not be more excited when I heard that

1126
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
I thought

1127
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
Hooray

1128
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,199
Just turned off this episode I was like I'm surprised

1129
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,783
Wow we've got to listen to some calls

1130
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,063
Man

1131
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Not a great session

1132
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
LMAO

1133
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,911
I Do by Albanese and real

1134
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,567
Question is I'm wondering

1135
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
What

1136
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
How are we supposed to get our information is

1137
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,967
16in shutting down

1138
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,135
I think they hung up on her

1139
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,999
You got to have that cost button there for that assholes

1140
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,047
Exhale

1141
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,351
I will say this

1142
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
I think Alex

1143
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
And I both

1144
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,007
Experience the same thing which is that I did not hear a single word

1145
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
The chief said

1146
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
I think for him it was because

1147
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,871
He responded to her name was just like

1148
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Yeah he was

1149
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
Steve was not happy about it

1150
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
And for me it was because

1151
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
I could not stop laughing is giving just hearing in May Van Gogh

1152
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,647
He's very pissed off

1153
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,999
He doesn't know or is it just that it's Andrea

1154
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
I think with the

1155
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:51,423
The problem is that he said the wrong name then she corrected the name gave to

1156
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
Too much of a correction

1157
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
And he doesn't care for this kind of thing

1158
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,335
So did the thing where she

1159
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
Asked if she was on the air which we all know

1160
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,687
Sure yes

1161
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,735
He has a hair-trigger with that

1162
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,807
So you get another call and this person

1163
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
Talk about hypothetical violence

1164
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
Violence

1165
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,719
But it could get to that point

1166
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,071
They keep going down this road what are we going to do

1167
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
What months they fix

1168
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
The boss

1169
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Do what they did

1170
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
And we just

1171
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
I just can't go along with

1172
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
Can't go along with

1173
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Alex's eating lunch

1174
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:38,015
I did that because I have to always

1175
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,367
You love catching him take a job there are recurring themes in the show

1176
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
I think that's the most

1177
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:52,351
Does that last call here on 23rd episode they're going to listen

1178
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,655
Come to a little bit of is

1179
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
Natural

1180
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
Infowars

1181
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,751
Kind of caller

1182
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
This is

1183
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
Not good

1184
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,847
I didn't enjoy hearing this

1185
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,687
I don't have anything against Jewish people like my wife

1186
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Children

1187
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,063
What is fortissimo on what is

1188
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Jews behind it

1189
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,423
What

1190
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Just ridiculous

1191
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
So this color is trying to speculate that there are a cult

1192
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,991
Jews who are behind stealing the election as well as the murder of the Tsar Allison

1193
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,599
Responses

1194
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
Dominion does Venezuela

1195
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
Instead of being like

1196
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Haggai

1197
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,535
How about how about you calm down with this

1198
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Cosmetic tropes

1199
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,863
Bro I've been doing one thing

1200
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
For twenty years

1201
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,959
And that is telling people I'm not an anti-semite

1202
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,543
And now you're making me say

1203
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,871
Izaka-ya that caller was bad

1204
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
So

1205
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
We get to the 24th and

1206
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,015
I was a little bit worried

1207
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
Alex Warren

1208
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
To do his last show I would you be worried about that is that a long long long long long track record of not follow

1209
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,279
Ali doesn't do those things

1210
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
So I was

1211
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Was very shocked

1212
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
When he started the show

1213
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
Head lineup

1214
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
I thought about

1215
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,799
Doing for a long time but haven't done yet for the live show

1216
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,663
And it says it all it says this might be my last broadcast Alex Jones

1217
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:48,063
I have that many points in my life where I'm almost at this on here because the situation was so serious

1218
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
Last Broadcast

1219
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
Every

1220
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
Minute on air

1221
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
As if it could be my last and I'm going to explain to you why

1222
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,863
I really just tell you the truth

1223
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,423
Duet

1224
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,263
About how serious the situation isn't worth

1225
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,359
Yeah so I think that this was the biggest

1226
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
Cop out

1227
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:16,223
It's like okay yeah this is going to be my last

1228
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:22,623
But it is just saying like let's live each day like it's our last yeah weird mode

1229
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:28,767
Motivational nonsense biblical on him and say this is lukewarm

1230
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,863
And we all know how the Great

1231
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
Feels about lukewarm

1232
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:41,311
I kind of wanted a little more out of the idea of the last episode than just this

1233
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
Conqueror

1234
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
It seemed a little flat to me

1235
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
I wanted a little bit more pageantry

1236
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,247
A little dramatic

1237
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,271
This is a little drummer

1238
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,087
Maybe not as dramatic as I want it to be

1239
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,671
Joe Biden's able to wiggle his way in the White House

1240
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,559
The White House and get the nuclear codes

1241
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,655
Then I will officially make the statement

1242
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
McLaren United States

1243
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
Creating a tombstone

1244
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
Carbon Stone

1245
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
Will in place

1246
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Here

1247
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,247
In the TV radio

1248
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:28,415
Lutheran and it'll be on sale at ShopRite

1249
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,791
I can have a keychain of that

1250
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
Pills shaped like tombstones

1251
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,399
Honestly I think we should do that

1252
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
First just to get out front

1253
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
I think that be hilarious

1254
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:47,103
Look I don't want to turn into kiss like when they're selling coffin

1255
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:52,223
Too much plus I don't think teepublic sells tombstone

1256
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,879
Now we might have to go to a boutique Redbubble

1257
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,207
So I mean

1258
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Alright

1259
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,535
I think that's a little dramatic but

1260
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,583
Alex is being very serious

1261
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,143
Let me get into it right now

1262
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
Tell you what's coming up

1263
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,287
Just getting into the basic news.

1264
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,199
Square app

1265
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Do it

1266
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
We're done

1267
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
I'm turning around

1268
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,951
She's very real

1269
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Okay

1270
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
Alright

1271
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
United States of America born

1272
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
July 4th 1776

1273
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
United States of America.

1274
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
January 20th

1275
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
B21

1276
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
Because if we don't admit

1277
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,271
How grave the situation is we don't have a shot

1278
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,671
Stopping this is Devin like a giant sell that tombstone

1279
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
How grave the situation now it's not bad not bad Alex

1280
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:16,959
What I appreciate the most witches avoid saying pun not intended sure

1281
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,263
Text administrate

1282
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,823
Alex's never put out a headline like this

1283
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,967
Like the maybe my last show ever

1284
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,063
Any idea of doing that

1285
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
And it turns out they f***** up the headline

1286
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,439
I've been reading and studying the globalist

1287
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
For 30-plus years

1288
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Digital screen

1289
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:53,055
This could be my last broadcast TuneIn if you want to save yourself never put a head on out of

1290
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,335
Have never

1291
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,663
Engineer

1292
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,967
Complete Global collapse

1293
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
The ashes

1294
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
A witch

1295
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
What

1296
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
But if you torture

1297
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,047
Voice memo real quick

1298
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
I can't talk about it

1299
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
Text iPad line

1300
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:26,335
Good last joke that's good stuff really

1301
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,455
I got really fast cuz I had just done

1302
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,783
Speed voice battle brothers

1303
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
Eva comic

1304
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
If a comic had a

1305
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,207
Absurd intro

1306
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
That day

1307
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
Is it had to be part of the whole bit right they wrote it

1308
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,095
You wrote it down for you

1309
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,375
Say like

1310
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
Repeat this after me

1311
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,543
Hey I have a tongue twister that you need to memorize

1312
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,103
You know I would say that like you

1313
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,639
Talking about doing his last

1314
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
Cheryl forever

1315
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
He's

1316
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Decided

1317
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
F*** I'm going to do it

1318
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,015
Prepare

1319
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,831
Because it's supposed to be a time capsule thing

1320
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
Isn't it supposed to be like

1321
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,695
Either be idea of his last episode to be like

1322
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,767
In case I go off air this is like

1323
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
A bottle

1324
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,375
This is a bottle episode stand-up to Greatness

1325
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,679
Going out like The Sopranos are right

1326
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:30,079
He's who he is and then the lights go off Valley no wrapping up any

1327
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,895
Anything does have a very serious message

1328
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,319
And the biggest message I have before I give you my personal message here is

1329
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
The people that serve the system the yuppies

1330
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,095
You're the biggest jumps of them all

1331
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
So delusional

1332
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,007
You think you're part of the ruling class

1333
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,311
You think you're part of the United States offer

1334
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,127
You think you're part of the winning team you or anything

1335
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
You are the week

1336
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Traders

1337
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,319
Actually chose to join this evil

1338
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Because you were speaking out power

1339
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,159
I think that Alex Wood

1340
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,231
Good we're leftist enforcers

1341
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Guess I mean

1342
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
If you had to wrestle with our existence

1343
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,167
It would obviously say that we're trying to shut him down

1344
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:30,751
We're like some Soros plan for some b*******

1345
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:37,151
And I I can sing you fully up enough checked in on this a lot again really really thought about it I'm not

1346
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
Thinking I'm part of the powers

1347
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:46,111
No no I don't think I can think of very few times in all of

1348
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,439
Cuban history when left us felt like they were on The Winning Side

1349
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:56,095
Yeah I want even talk about you and me you're one of

1350
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:01,983
Three or four people

1351
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,335
My parents

1352
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,615
Soros

1353
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
That's it

1354
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
Oh s***

1355
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:13,247
Yeah that's all three

1356
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
No I am

1357
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,367
Yeah I just I find this to be a really bizarre

1358
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,207
Thing for him to say he's like his big messages

1359
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,535
You people are chumps

1360
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
The last message is like

1361
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:34,751
A playground insult based in vindictiveness and ambitious understanding the people you disagree with

1362
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Great scares

1363
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,335
Your last message is a waste

1364
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,639
Trivio annoying

1365
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,967
Anyway remember how globalists don't have kids

1366
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:50,879
100% of globalist don't have correct

1367
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,487
And Bill Gates

1368
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
None of them have to Rob at all of them

1369
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
Nothing

1370
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Does not kids

1371
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Touche

1372
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
Free market capitalist Society

1373
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
They say the save-the-earth but really

1374
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,551
When they live the most popular lifestyle to have all these children

1375
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:24,159
Wait wait hold on there's all these children they don't have kids and Future

1376
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,719
Oh maybe nothing you say means anything

1377
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Write 99% of

1378
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,095
Alright 100%

1379
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,215
There's a photo of fauci

1380
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,751
15 years ago

1381
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,055
Doesn't have kids

1382
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
Spell Tom Brokaw George Soros

1383
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
None of them have kids

1384
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
Walters

1385
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
Clippers

1386
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Lady

1387
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,415
Anderson Cooper's mom is Gloria Vanderbilt know that because he keeps

1388
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:02,047
Talk about how he's the last Vanderbilt not straight

1389
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:07,679
Brooke Astor had one child who died in 2014 at the age of 90

1390
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,239
Significantly older than

1391
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:15,359
Going to soon

1392
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
The batting average going down

1393
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
Haha

1394
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:22,015
So this is supposed to be as last episode

1395
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,063
I've already brought this up

1396
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,599
I'm really struggling with this

1397
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Because

1398
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
It shouldn't

1399
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Be

1400
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
Timestamp

1401
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
It should be dated

1402
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,023
If I were Alex

1403
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,815
I would stay away from

1404
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Headlines

1405
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,631
I would stay away from like

1406
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,423
Things are going back out this is

1407
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823
This is November 2020 stuff right here if it's your last show

1408
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
Victory lap you do like here all of our achievements do a f****** commentary for endgame anyting

1409
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
This is your life

1410
01:12:55,295 --> 01:13:00,927
Although you wouldn't be able to get too many of his comeback

1411
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,743
Instead what he does is like just headlines

1412
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:09,375
New York City

1413
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,471
Grab

1414
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,383
Provide education and

1415
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
So that's martial law

1416
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
The secret police

1417
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,439
Some reality covid-19 New York

1418
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,743
To stop everyone like you might imagine

1419
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
What Alex's

1420
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,607
It specifically about people arriving in New York from out of state

1421
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,447
Will be so much like they snatch people out there testing on site

1422
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:50,591
There's no they want to advise people arriving to the city about quarantine requirements you could be hit with

1423
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
Define if you don't follow

1424
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,175
I don't like this much

1425
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
Because

1426
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
You know it's

1427
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,783
Scary but also I don't like this pandemic

1428
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,855
And people not taking it seriously so here we are

1429
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
Also I'm much more interested in another part of the sheriff Joseph sushito his comment

1430
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,047
About this stuff okay

1431
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Quote

1432
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:16,959
Deputy sheriff's are investigating massive event that violate a panoply of criminal fire building

1433
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,775
Help and other regulatory laws at locations

1434
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
Such as illegal Fight Club

1435
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,383
Underground raves in illegal gambling Den

1436
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:31,295
These activities were illegal and sometimes deadly before covid-19 have a public safety hazards regarded them as

1437
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Amplified

1438
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,855
Exponentially by the pandemic

1439
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:38,463
I did not know that he legal fight clubs were a modern problem in New York

1440
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,863
But I want Alex to talk more about that instead of a subtle bulshit

1441
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,263
Deadly illegal fight the problem of the problem that we're seeing now is too many people in New York

1442
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Are cool

1443
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,847
I should have known I mean I guess

1444
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,663
Like I don't know I guess I should have assumed there would be

1445
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Fight Club

1446
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
I just

1447
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
I didn't ask

1448
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,999
Well that there aren't fight clubs but it does look like it's not like Fight Club

1449
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,535
The movie

1450
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:19,935
I would assume it's a strange thing to read in that statement

1451
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,543
Totally understand totally understand

1452
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
Always going to

1453
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,223
Even in Foods besides tore torn countries have underground raves in underground gambling

1454
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
Fight clubs though bro

1455
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,831
The first one on his list

1456
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Yeah

1457
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:44,255
That makes me sound like fight clubs are real issue for now

1458
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,815
Before rains on the list is even more like

1459
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
What

1460
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:52,191
Anyway I think Alex is burying the lead on this one

1461
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:58,847
She doesn't live on his final episode and certain things will not look so good

1462
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,639
Good lot of his covid feeling

1463
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
In particular

1464
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
And these centers

1465
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Hospital

1466
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Special

1467
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,951
Execution Docs

1468
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719

01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
It could be a duck

1474
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
Look for executing leftist

1475
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
Sittin on the Electra sex

1476
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
Dock of the Bay

1477

You didn't. Covid

1481
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Kill you

1482
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
When you chained down

1483
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
When your lungs

1484
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
I get off on it

1485
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,119
To walk over glass

1486
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
They're going to kill you and your fam

1487
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
We got a lot of

1488
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
Reported reports

1489
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,567
Reportedly doing a lot of work for one adverb

1490
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,591
Yeah

1491
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:08,223
I mean for the people who are First Responders and people who are in the medical field who are being

1492
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,807
Deeply traumatized by virtue of the help

1493
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,647
But they're providing and what they have to see

1494
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,183
This is such a disgusting

1495
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,207
Something to

1496
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
To be putting out

1497
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
Into the world

1498
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,071
This disorder perspective is just shameful

1499
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,375
On dead like

1500
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
Bittrex

1501
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
In terms of his career

1502
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,031
Like you said a lot of really f***** up horrible things at this

1503
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Kind of thing

1504
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:37,407
Hi continuously through this characterization of medical professionals

1505
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Dealing with this crisis like

1506
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
It's

1507
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:44,575
It's up there with Sandy Hook it's up there with the Boston bombing really

1508
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
It's disgraceful

1509
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,463
No we can we can talk about Italy actionable necessarily but it's as gross

1510
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,327
Right no I mean it this is this goes back to our earlier conversation to you know we can

1511
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,399
We can talk about all the hundreds of

1512
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,423
Songs of deaths which are

1513
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
Are f****** terrifying

1514
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
Tragic

1515
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,007
An awful but at the same time

1516
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,567
There are millions of people

1517
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,407
Millions of people who are going to live with the effects of this f******

1518
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:16,063
Psychic Destruction for the rest of their life and not to mention people who don't.

1519
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,343
Die but have

1520
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
You know effect

1521
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,279
Jackson lingering Health consequences that aren't captured by statistical out Untold

1522
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,583
Story that people have to live with

1523
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,351
And like

1524
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:33,727
I mean just something small like hey guess what for the rest of your life you have shortness of breath forever

1525
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
That's it

1526
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,079
And you're like I understand that that you know

1527
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Yeah

1528
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Just f***** you

01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,455
Runner before it now you're not

There are tons of things like that

1531
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:50,367
And then the situation fits doctors and nurses

1532
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
Irr put in

1533
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:56,511
People who are medical professionals who have been infected themselves

1534
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,071
It's just it's just

1535
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Disgusting I mean like

1536
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:04,447
The evolution from there just f****** in the hospital and getting drunk

1537
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:07,007
To take kill you and laugh at you

1538
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,103
Just go f*** yourself at least people would have happily executed

1539
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
Clinton

1540
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
For Benghazi

1541
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
She shop

1542
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
You know

1543
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:21,343
Like happily would have executed

1544
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Well they were strapped down

1545
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,695
Charlie Daniels

1546
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,999
Tweet about it anymore

1547
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Look

1548
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,095
The shity and I think it's a board

1549
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,679
To take those moments and be kind of serious about it because

1550
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,751
But there's also time to laugh

1551
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
Like when Alex talks

1552
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
About Alex

1553
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,591
With swabs and guns

1554
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Too good

1555
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
WhatsApp

1556
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,663
Are they back

1557
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,735
The Daleks are back we have an update

1558
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,063
Okay they have been disarmed

1559
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,719
You deserve that I think we left I think

1560
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,535
Laugh too much at it but now

1561
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:07,679
The Daleks are not our

1562
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
It rent-a-cars

1563
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Why do trains

1564
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
Going to the police officers

1565
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
Robots that come up with

1566
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,528
Schwab

1567
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
Bye-bye

1568
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,392
Secret

1569
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
Covid facility

1570
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
Staffed by

1571
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,232
FIFA.

1572
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
Okay

1573
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Keto

1574
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
It's the small things

1575
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
That make me know

1576
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
He's listening

1577
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,936
Small things for your like

1578
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
You knew

1579
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:47,872
Guns in the Daleks is to buy a funny and 20

1580
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:54,272
You found out and we all know like Icarus flew too close to the Sun

1581
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:03,744
You're going to like the hilarious territory

1582
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,584
That's why now it's a f****** Dalek with a swab and there's

1583
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,376
Cops with guns behind them

1584
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,240
That's somehow so that's fill your s*** to me cuz now

1585
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,080
Now we're not just sending dog that we've increased our infrastructure cost

1586
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,920
Now you're cops who were working with Dalek partners

1587
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,480
So it raises the question why

1588
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,528
You couldn't just have the cops swab

1589
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,368
I got a new movie4u sequel the K-9 cop

1590
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
Dollarconnect

1591
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,928
Solving crime

1592
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,536
I could see that I would watch that sort of

1593
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:43,168
Really hyper focused on the Dalek and we're not talking about how there are antifa Berger Hospital

1594
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
Sure

1595
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:50,848
Barbie we always know those horses Dad we don't need to worry about that

1596
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,152
Activa murder hospitals

1597
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,968
I sometimes wish

1598
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,992
We were at

1599
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:03,392
Cool as they think we are I would love for that to be like the next blumhouse movie or something

1600
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,208
What it could be like a real

1601
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,024
Be kind of horror movie that caters to the

1602
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:15,424
Conservative audience

1603
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Julie

1604
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:21,568
It was a false flag by the Nazis in the antifa murder

1605
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,640
I'm sorry

1606
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,480
Bingo is

1607
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,552
Justifiable pretty sure you can yell.

1608
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,856
In a crowded theater that was never settled

1609
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,160
I just don't want the neighbors to get

1610
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,256
Some sort of very weird idea about what's going on like the idea that there

1611
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
That we're suddenly screaming like

1612
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Call Chet.

1613
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,680
New thing to complain about

1614
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,216
A new primary source

1615
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
And I will get into it a little bit after

1616
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,408
You just saw Hugh in Rockefeller

1617
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Lockstep plan

1618
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,248
10 years ago and they put lock stuff out

1619
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
On paper

1620
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
What you just saw

1621
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,112
With the woman in charge

1622
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,440
Your family

1623
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,536
She can't travel she gets meet once a year

1624
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,352
Cosmic look into a robot machine

1625
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,472
Who did that tell you for them what they're going to be what they're going to do

1626
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,288
That wasn't some

1627
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,616
Cartoon made by George Orwell

1628
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
Saying all this is terrible

1629
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
They're saying this is good

1630
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,992
Because they're showing children that

1631
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:39,648
The Descent to ask the one-day years on her birthday

1632
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,416
Planned opolis

1633
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:44,000
Presenting this with no evidence

1634
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
I'm saying that it

1635
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,424
Something that was forcefully shown to kids show

1636
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,800
Possible that it might have been shown in some classrooms an educational setting

1637
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:00,128
But I'm certain he's making it up because it's a cartoon

1638
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,920
It's believable

1639
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,480
Be shown in classrooms

1640
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,368
A kid as somebody who knows his Miyazaki history I'm pretty sure that Orwell worked on Spirited Away

1641
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
Perhaps

1642
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,976
It could have been nausicaa of the Valley of the wind but a pretty sure is.

1643
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,512
I have to say

1644
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,560
For Alex's

1645
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Sake

1646
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,352
He did

1647
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,400
Fairly accurately describe this

1648
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,680
Kisscartoon

1649
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
Alright

1650
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
That's good

1651
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,008
There is a woman

1652
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:33,408
Who has their limited travel you can only have meat on your birthday for husband is hooked up to a machine at work

1653
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,968
Right. In the way that maybe

1654
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,504
Ueu my fantasize

1655
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,784
That being butts

1656
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,856
There's a video from a group called forum for the future

1657
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
In 2011 they released

1658
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:48,000
Series of videos that sought to depict what the potential cities of the future could look like given

1659
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,304
Trends that were existing fan in the world

1660
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,096
Habit

1661
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,656
He's found one that he thinks he can claim is prosthetics

1662
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,984
Eddie's choosing to ignore the fact that there were four scenarios

1663
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,008
Status gruppe depict

1664
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,152
The one how it's Joseph closest to the things that he makes his audience scared they strongly centralized government

1665
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
Food rationing Etc

1666
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
Scenario title

1667
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,552
Planned opolis but there was also communis City

1668
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
And renewable

1669
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:21,280
These are each depictions of how City Planning could evolve in a scenario where alternative energy sources were made primary

1670
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,608
And what life might look like depending on the strategies that are employed

1671
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,424
None of this is my telestrator plan

1672
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,008
It's an exploration exercise as the people who put the

1673
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,568
This Together actually said explicitly

1674
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:39,456
Quote for the future scenarios are not predictions or depictions of desirable Futures which we wished

1675
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,784
To promote and they do not represent our vision of a sustainable future

1676
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:48,672
They're pictures of different possible future is designed to help people understand the major trends that are shaping our world

1677
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:53,792
The emperor challenge Inspire and excite so that people feel motivated to plan for a better

1678
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
More sustainable

1679
01:25:55,328 --> 01:26:00,448
Yeah I mean this is almost exactly the same thing as the lockstep where he's taking that one

1680
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
Plan

1681
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:06,080
Scenario out of the 48 decided

1682
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,968
Oh my God

1683
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,808
Not going to talk about renewable

1684
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,344
Although now that

1685
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,136
The moment you said renew Abad

1686
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,536
I got transported into the writers room with the Whiteboard and the million different city name puns

1687
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,400
And it's just I that's where I would that's where I belong Dead coming up with

1688
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:37,056
Renewable names for to print sidhe also renewable doesn't think what I'm doing sit ups

1689
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Sure

1690
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:45,504
So this is this is a bunch of nonsense but I do think that it's probably going to be a very large

1691
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
Piece of

1692
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
Probably can be the next block

1693
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,160
Planned opolis

1694
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Her mother

1695
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:57,024
But the thing that's really weird when I was looking into this there like Reddit threads

1696
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,816
From 2012

1697
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:05,216
2015 about that around for a while.

1698
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
New

1699
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
So

1700
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
Here's where things get weird

1701
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,128
Does Alex's last show

1702
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
This is last show

1703
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,456
I am job

1704
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,528
I thought she wants you to know that the the global

1705
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,088
I believe it they're getting messages or mail

1706
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,112
I'm sure we know this

1707
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
That's what I believe that

1708
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,720
He doesn't believe that

1709
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
Yes

1710
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,304
He's not crazy

1711
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,840
This is what they believe exact

1712
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
He's reporting on this as a scientist

1713
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
Now wait till the end of this clip

1714
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,520
The globalist follow this

1715
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,800
Believe

1716
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
Interdimensional

1717
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
Information

1718
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,944
It's like in the movie Buckaroo Banzai

1719
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
A Grade B movie

1720
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,016
Believe

1721
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,576
Information

1722
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,856
Bill dish

1723
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,672
Transmission forever

1724
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:00,256
You can go back to those ancient civilization 6000 years ago

1725
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:07,168
Double helix

1726
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,496
Preachers came from

1727
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,568
The dog star

1728
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,384
Sirius to tell them

1729
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,760
We talked about that whole thing in a Project Camelot episode so yeah

1730
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
That's something he should take

1731
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,088
Think about if Alex believes

1732
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,160
Flippy's aliens came down and told these poor thing

1733
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:32,512
These people did get this information that I couldn't possibly have from any other source to FM that would

1734
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,048
Imply that it isn't

1735
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
Just

1736
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
What the globalist believe if you

1737
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,400
Call Donna

1738
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,752
The movie

1739
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,312
Alien movies all about it

1740
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,664
They are. They knew all of this

1741
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
They built it

1742
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,880
Kill everybody and I'll give you the phone codes

1743
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,208
You know Satan's Odyssey

1744
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
Do you

1745
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
And so

1746
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,656
Obviously they're not going to be giving Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates or not

1747
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,704
They're so

1748
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,288
They're like ham radio operators you know transmission from

1749
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Japan or something

1750
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:28,064
Just like the Bible says there is a fallen just like the vibe

1751
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,624
Another dimension

1752
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,952
Government

1753
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
Embryonic stage

1754
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
Alarm

1755
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,120
Us to destroy ourselves

1756
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,400
Will do it

1757
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,960
Ausbuild

1758
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
Okay

1759
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,408
So the globalist believe that they're getting

1760
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:58,528
Promises from Aliens Kill Everybody

1761
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:03,904
And I'm look I know I sound crazy saying this but that's just what they believe now I should tell you

1762
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
But they are getting

1763
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,024
These messages from a transdimensional dependents Shore

1764
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,048
Where in the Bible

1765
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,328
And that's what's going on

1766
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
Well that's up

1767
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
Okay

1768
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
Seems I hate

1769
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
To be a dick

1770
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,288
What about seems kind of like a technical

1771
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,872
It does seem like what he say

1772
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,688
What are you saying is they believe I'm not crazy

1773
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,784
They believe that their King interdimensional messages

1774
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,344
When we all know it's a demon

1775
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,976
Devil from a different dimension sending the messages when I understand it's completely different

1776
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,024
We might also be an alien

1777
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
Sure

1778
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
Yeah this is silly

1779
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,144
And we all know safe

1780
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,960
The fever

1781
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,520
Rich

1782
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,360
Okay so let's entertain this

1783
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
For one sec

1784
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Alright

1785
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,712
Bezos

1786
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:04,064
Gates not getting Eternal Light

1787
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,392
That suggest to them that they will receive eternal life yes

1788
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,696
Now he's a real issue that they just

1789
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,512
Haven't talked to Alex yet and had Alex be like

1790
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
Nah nah nah nah that's

1791
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
The devil you're not actually

1792
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,096
Going to get a turn

1793
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,376
They're lying

1794
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,680
Is that all we need

1795
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:23,520
We just need to get Bezos and Alex in a room together

1796
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,056
I think we should

1797
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,872
Nope I think that I think we should get them in a room together

1798
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,152
Put a big dome over it

1799
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,224
So it turns out

1800
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,760
You can talk to aliens

1801
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,040
Or the devil

1802
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,344
Do you take drugs

1803
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
Electrocute yourself

1804
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:39,904
Could you stream

1805
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,952
Alex later says you can just like

1806
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:46,560
Do that thing where you choke yourself against a while

1807
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,656
So they're even getting everyone ready

1808
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,472
Okay and so it's on it's on

1809
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
On

1810
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,544
It's on you can electrocute yourself

1811
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,616
You can have your heart stopped and do what you can take

1812
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,664
Flatliners

1813
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,040
Boy when they do it do they break through

1814
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,160
Exactly what happened

1815
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,208
He goes through the wall the other side

1816
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,000
You don't come back the same day

1817
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:21,632
Buckaroo Banzai predictive programming about how you could commune with the Devil

1818
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
You know

1819
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,984
I knew it was always going to come down to RoboCop

1820
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,520
In one of his many roles

1821
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:33,152
But I didn't expect it to be Buckaroo Banzai that was too happy and joyful film

1822
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:37,504
Also was full of very very subtle messages about the

1823
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Now that'll happen

1824
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:46,720
Open episode where Alex was incoherent f***** up on something and one of the questions from the Reddit ask

1825
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,792
Anything was about Buckaroo Banzai Isaac Marisa

1826
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:56,448
Public is being cagey he does not like revealing that he's a big nerd which is

1827
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:02,848
Weird to me for the grace of God

1828
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:09,248
I have been Alex Jones if I was just so insecure about my nerdiness when I was in like fourth grade

1829
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,320
Probably were

1830
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:18,720
I think it would also require an inability to understand the things you were reading

1831
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:22,048
Essential piece of what makes Alex Alex

1832
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:26,912
Like a lack of reading comprehension inability to comprehend what you read

1833
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,448
Map mixed with

1834
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,496
A pretty high functioning

1835
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:34,336
Like a memory or we called and asked to recall

1836
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:38,944
But just not a not a good understanding

1837
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:45,600
Also being really insecure

1838
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:50,208
That is well

1839
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,000
Bob Bob

1840
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,048
Do The Imperial March sorry

1841
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:58,656
Just as bad as yelling

1842
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,680
Neighbors travel

1843
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,216
So Alex has a plug here

1844
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
And

1845
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,776
This made me pretty sad

1846
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,824
I didn't plug last hour

1847
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,128
I don't plug won't be

1848
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,224
I am spending all the money we've got I have expended

1849
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:15,040
Much of our reserves going to Georgia

1850
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,624
I going to Arizona and going to be

1851
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,672
What is series of great invest

1852
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,024
Really got the achieve results out of

1853
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
Georgia

1854
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,376
Arizona DC Caravan

1855
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:34,240
Really set the world on fire with that Caravan we're still hearing about it

1856
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
The Ripple

1857
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
The Caravan

1858
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,384
The stop this steel Caravan

1859
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:44,736
I mean it's changed the political landscape

1860
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,040
I think pretty seriously

1861
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
This will be

1862
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,136
Maybe one of the few times Dan where

1863
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,440
You have absolutely

1864
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
8 likes

1865
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,280
The caravana T project will live on forever

1866
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,072
Long after the Caravan is

1867
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:03,680
I don't believe that I didn't realize something

1868
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
I got a phone call

1869
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:15,200
I got lieutenant colonel

1870
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,272
Gavin Newsom

1871
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,088
Highly highly The Big E

1872
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,880
Figures

1873
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:25,440
Ghost politics sure they're terrified

1874
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:30,048
That they're going to do another Carousel travel that's trouble

1875
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,072
Out of trouble

1876
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:37,728
I can see Feinstein's bones jigglin they're so afraid of

1877
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:43,104
Crowds of tens of people

1878
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,432
They'll get all the way to Nevada

1879
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
I mean

1880
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,296
I don't believe this is necessarily going to be what happened

1881
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,344
But I do think that there would be a certain

1882
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,880
Cosmic hilarity

1883
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:58,976
If like Alex ends up going broke because of this bad

1884
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:05,376
It'd be so great we could have another year but I thought it was a good idea to send Owen to bet

1885
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
Baton Rouge

1886
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:12,288
I want the armored car to take him down I want that severe

1887
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,360
You could be living out of that armor

1888
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:21,504
Such every bad boss that I've ever known I got a bunker

1889
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,576
The Stag I got a bunch of beans

1890
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,928
Every bad boss I've ever known has been just like that where it's like

1891
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
Guys

1892
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:35,584
Unfortunately we're only going to be able to do a small raise this year it's just going to be a 2%

1893
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
Anyways

1894
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,656
I bought an armored van

1895
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,728
Like

1896
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
F*** off

1897
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,288
Yeah you guys are the worst

1898
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:49,152
So answer the Gaston which I thought was weird okay it's your last show

1899
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,456
Do your f****** last show

1900
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,248
Don't have guests on

1901
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
Unless it's Steve

1902
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,624
Because he belongs on your last shower sure he has ruined your life, right

1903
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:05,280
Wearing a black robe over

1904
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
10 with a site

1905
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
It's not it's not

1906
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,448
Is Omnibus I'm not going to go over

1907
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,984
This whole giant bio

1908
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,032
A lot of big companies

1909
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,896
Again list of all he was the CEO Overstock it started that

1910
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,736
Ranchworld.com is the first major online site

1911
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:31,904
Coin so yeah this Patrick Bernie was the CEOs Overstock

1912
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,720
He had an intimate relationship with Maria butina

1913
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:39,584
The Russian woman who played guilty to conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent

1914
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,424
I had to resign because of

1915
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
Yeah he's mixed up in some s***

1916
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:51,872
African Republic meltdown and said that the FBI forced him to have a relationship with her and you made it but

1917
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,200
That's a good I like that

1918
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,736
I don't care about Patrick Byrne

1919
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:03,136
I'm just pushing the same sort of dominion can shore shore shore shore and also

1920
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,672
First thing is that

1921
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
If he's

1922
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,488
To be believed

1923
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:08,768
He's

1924
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,352
Feeding information to Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell

1925
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:16,192
The information that they're putting out he's taking credit

1926
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
4

1927
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,520
So you're telling me that somebody

1928
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
Who lost

1929
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,640
Is insanely perhaps obscenely high paying jobs

1930
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
Yep

1931
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:30,528
Because of having an illicit affair with a foreign agent

1932
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,344
Is now telling me several years later

1933
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,416
I'm feeding information to Rudy Giuliani

1934
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,184
Someone who

1935
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,024
Never ever had any connection to any sort of Russian intelligence

1936
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:45,376
Whatsoever correct here's the problem is just full of s***

1937
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,680
And so I don't know if I believe

1938
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:51,776
That I don't believe him at all I'm going to say and then it has a pattern

1939
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
True

1940
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
Not great

1941
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,896
Then it's not an interview either I don't really care

1942
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,432
I'll be at alexcis

1943
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,968
Another guest salon

1944
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,064
Maybe this is somebody who should be on his last show but

1945
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,344
Come the f*** on

1946
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,928
Hour and 15 minutes

1947
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,952
Don't kausen

1948
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,232
Is the one thing only

1949
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
David Icke

1950
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,816
The turd in the punch bowl

1951
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:21,216
The guy who earlier on in his career Alex would say is meant to make conspiracy thinkers and

1952
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
Who asked question

1953
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:27,872
Should give him a bad name because he talks about lizards and shape-shifted folks

1954
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,224
Oh wait I'm that now

1955
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:38,880
Is there something actually kind of spiritually appropriate I love the idea that on his last show

1956
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,672
He's sitting here and just like

1957
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:47,328
Kissing David Icke sent more of like a Reconciliation of reconciliation like a

1958
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:51,424
Kind of music reconciliation at the end you know where they're both sitting there like

1959
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:54,240
You know we disagreed about a lot of stuff but

1960
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
Now I can see

1961
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,568
I'm also full of s*** to

1962
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:01,152
I I think there's two things one I would like to see

1963
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,944
A bringing back

1964
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,064
Of people like Jason bermas

1965
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,880
Radowski these people from back

1966
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:16,768
Wayback wijmenga seeing how they get along now that would be a good last year

1967
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,584
But I also think that this is really good too because

1968
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,632
Like Alex resented David Icke

1969
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,424
For a long time

1970
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,192
David Icke

1971
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
Did not give a

1972
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,752
Single flock

1973
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,288
It just did his thing

1974
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,336
Another. Technically that's a good thing

1975
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,152
The David I did his thing

1976
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:39,040
Beginning

1977
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
To the end

1978
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:45,696
I mean this isn't the last episode obviously Alex had a show on Wednesday

1979
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,744
To the hypothetical last show

1980
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,048
David Icke stands is a morsel

1981
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
Successful

1982
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
Yeah more popular

1983
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,376
Better

1984
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,912
Situated

1985
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
Figure in the

1986
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,496
Conspiracy world yeah then Alex could ever be

1987
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
And Alex

1988
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
Has now been brought low

1989
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:06,688
Hogan had to been that's brewed I had to bend to me to someone like David Icke

1990
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,224
Here's my pitch

1991
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,504
On Alex's actual

1992
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,368
We actually we full-on do a this is your life

1993
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,952
Right shirt you have to hear the voice disembodied

1994
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,488
Before you know who it is

1995
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,512
This coming on there

1996
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
I want

1997
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:24,352
To get so many different voices just to see

1998
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,888
How much he flinches

1999
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
Like hearing his

2000
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,704
Former friends boys just being like

2001
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:38,176
I want to hear it's like you know those are always very positive oh my God

2002
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,200
You know be great is

2003
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,248
As if Rapaport

2004
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,040
Was a master of impressions

2005
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
I need to do like

2006
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,880
The voices of people

2007
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
Who hate Alex now like Webster

2008
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,952
Guitar player something

2009
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:56,096
Sure I bet he's like now Webster has working with you

2010
01:41:56,608 --> 01:42:02,752
We're on Voice number 15 Alex you should assume by now it's me oh God I love you Rappaport

2011
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,056
Had me scared there

2012
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:10,944
What Ike is here and basically what is big thing is is there's no covid

2013
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,720
Even if you believe that

2014
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,768
On the basis of

2015
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,472
There is no deadly virus

2016
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,312
The boss majority

2017
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,736
Okay that's not the response you're supposed to have

2018
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,040
Yeah I today but I coming on in

2019
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:51,904
I am just saying that there is no virus have been convinced of this the whole time

2020
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,232
But let's stipulate that there is just me

2021
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,560
Just in case some of your listeners are ready for the

2022
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,608
Proof that there is no virus

2023
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
That's fitting

2024
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,936
For the last year

2025
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:08,288
For Alex to have a gas to saying things that directly contradict

2026
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:10,080
Literally everything

2027
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:15,712
I bet he believes him be like you're still on target you're the best

2028
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,784
Should one last clip Heroes David Icke from the final app

2029
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,576
Episode of the Alex.

2030
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
Go fuc

2031
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
Yourself David Icke

2032
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:40,800
Best route through isolation

2033
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:48,224
This is absolutely not true and David actually absolutely ashamed of himself for passing along

2034
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,760
Bulshit

2035
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:56,160
There's an article in the journal emerging infectious diseases from June 2020 with the title quotes severe acute

2036
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,232
Respiratory Syndrome syndrome coronavirus 2

2037
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:01,792
From patient with coronavirus disease United's

2038
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,096
I'll redo this from the abstract

2039
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:10,240
Quote we are isolated virus from nasal pharyngeal and oropharyngeal

2040
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:14,592
Specimens from the patient and characterize the virus replication process

2041
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,384
And cell culture trophy

2042
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
Isolated

2043
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:23,552
Even discusses how they were able to take us isolated virus and creative

2044
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
Do you know I'm seeking

2045
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:30,208
Which Bay made available to the domestic and international Public Health academic and pharmaceutical sectors

2046
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,792
Her basic research diagnostic development antiviral testing

2047
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Development

2048
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:41,216
Actually goes on to bring up this study which contradict this point there is no paper that shows this

2049
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:47,360
It's not a problem for him though because he then claims this paper is bogus citing the expertise of a guy named Tom Cowan

2050
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:53,248
Who's put out a video about how 5G is poisoning ourselves

2051
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,016
Also

2052
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:59,136
Calvin is a holistic medicine guy whose medical license is currently on probation because quote

2053
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,696
Among other things he had offered an

2054
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,768
Drug to a breast cancer patient without

2055
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,560
It wasn't approved for use

2056
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:11,936
He also never saw the patient in person or did he review her full medical file according to documents

2057
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:14,752
From the medical board of California detailing why

2058
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
He was to be disciplined

2059
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:20,128
Listen to this dude anyway go f*** yourself David Icke

2060
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
You're a real pile of s***

2061
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,712
And it's fitting that I would have you

2062
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
As a guest

2063
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,760
On your last job

2064
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:30,880
On a scale of 1 to 35 Hitler mustache

2065
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:38,048
22 months that I think that's too probably yeah probably a lot of

2066
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,864
Yeah but one Hitler mustache is still one

2067
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
Too many

2068
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,472
I mean by that it's really about how you look at the scale

2069
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,496
You know I'd like

2070
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:48,032
That's one of those things

2071
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,568
There are limits

2072
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,408
I don't see how saying on a show right now

2073
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,992
That the virus isn't real is any

2074
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
From from yelling fire in a

2075
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,112
You know like that's just the reality of the situation

2076
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,416
There's no difference you're killing me

2077
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,560
I agree with you except

2078
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
4

2079
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:15,168
I don't know just be a bility to make direct line

2080
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,192
You know.

2081
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:19,264
If you yell fire in a crowded building obviously you see the effects

2082
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,336
The immediate effects

2083
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,640
Much harder to trace Direct

2084
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:32,576
People who were affected and sure this is the reason that they behaved in the way they did all right

2085
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,112
Trace bulshit

2086
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:36,416
I agree

2087
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,464
I don't know what the answer

2088
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,744
That is I don't I don't

2089
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
I hate it

2090
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,048
I think it sucks

2091
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,328
Murder Hornets

2092
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,608
Murder Hornets

2093
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
How about this

2094
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,912
Stalker

2095
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,448
Daleks

2096
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,472
I like it

2097
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,544
What would we put nardella compartments

2098
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,080
Hornet

2099
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:01,248
Okay take this mob released murder Hornets

2100
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:06,112
He's so weird because just like all right take the swab

2101
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,672
No I won't

2102
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:15,328
What the f*** thank you Dallas

2103
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,168
I got to say

2104
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,472
I admire Alex

2105
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
Thanks for doing his last

2106
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:23,776
You know like

2107
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,568
He said he was going to do it

2108
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,336
Sure

2109
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,872
I don't admire what he

2110
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,640
He did though

2111
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,176
Again

2112
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,968
People running into this a lot

2113
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,760
Yeah we could do this better than her

2114
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,600
Internet if you have this opportunity to do your last show

2115
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
Don't just do your show

2116
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:40,928
Don't talk

2117
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,768
Bird about Dominion conspiracies that'll be stale

2118
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
Tomorrow

2119
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
Don't do

2120
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:50,144
Interview with David Icke where it just becomes trance

2121
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,680
Apparently clear how

2122
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,448
Munchies

2123
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472
Trade your own

2124
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
Assertive beliefs in your career

2125
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,080
Do something that is like

2126
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,152
Retrospect I honestly think

2127
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,456
Like just revisiting endgame

2128
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,992
Would have been amazing probably

2129
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,016
That would have been amazing

2130
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:12,416
That really wasn't so confused by some of the theories that he had remembered

2131
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:18,816
Prepared you would think that he knew everything about his phone

2132
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,888
Biography on this

2133
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,424
Billion later

2134
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,520
Why didn't people fill this in

2135
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,616
Pull up going on

2136
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:36,736
Somebody get that in carded this from way back in my automated bibliography sucks always with me

2137
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:41,344
Yeah I would I would be interested in something like that or no

2138
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:45,184
Blowing hard for a couple hours just about like

2139
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:53,120
Northern Lights three hours of esoteric

2140
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:57,216
Alix Talton out all kinds of theories about all kinds of s*** needs

2141
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:03,360
To be something that can live as a document clearly

2142
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,128
Have

2143
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:10,528
Talked about doing it as an idea for a long time before I'm finally going to do this thing

2144
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,600
His last episode this hypothetical last episode

2145
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,648
Got to be a concept episode

2146
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,720
Flat

2147
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:19,744
The guest

2148
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
Terrible

2149
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,560
This stuff's embarrassing like

2150
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,328
Epiphany

2151
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,632
To be remembered as his last episode

2152
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,168
He's do no getting

2153
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:32,800
Change it wrong all over the place he's big messages the the left there are chops

2154
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,616
Sure every great dog talking about how

2155
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,664
If you go to a hospital for covid

2156
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,480
The mt4 will murder you and they're in their murder.

2157
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:46,112
That's going to stand the test of time he's rambling about planned opolis Shores already again

2158
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,648
It's a conspiracy that stale

2159
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:53,280
Almost as soon as it comes out of his mouth obvious thing that his last show

2160
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,304
What's up

2161
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,096
Just a movie Roundup

2162
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,400
All the movies

2163
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,960
That he is based all of his b******* on

2164
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
He just

2165
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,520
Start playing clips

2166
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,824
Man he does a full-on clip show of like

2167
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,128
Hey you remember this conspiracy theory

2168
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,408
This one's from Oblivion

2169
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,176
Alright

2170
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,968
Alright now let's move on to the next one

2171
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,504
I remember this one logo

2172
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,904
Run you guys ever see that that's my class like he does do that as he doesn't mean to hurt you or a crew bonsai

2173
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,952
Comprehensive

2174
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,000
Like do the whole filmography

2175
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:27,328
AMC also let me just say

2176
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,608
Dangerous message

2177
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,144
Descend on your show

2178
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,728
That you can talk to Demons or aliens if you electrocute yourself

2179
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:40,128
What if somebody listening wants to talk to those alien well that's true

2180
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:44,736
That I should try any of those things well now but now I obviously

2181
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
We need to

2182
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
Yeah

2183
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,088
I give this to thumbs down

2184
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,392
The Caravan

2185
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,720
It's just another thing that gets me so f****** excited

2186
01:50:54,976 --> 01:51:00,096
And that is such a by such a let-down Alex cannot help but be disappointing

2187
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
B

2188
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,192
I should say

2189
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,216
I'm back

2190
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,008
To where I

2191
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,032
Like to be

2192
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:14,432
Which is I'm ready to be disappointed consistent there was a stretch where I was very much just like

2193
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,784
It's getting tiresome that I'm being disappointed over and over again

2194
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,576
Now there's a bit more charm

2195
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,696
I can't help but think that it's all just

2196
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,768
Because I'm building things up again

2197
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,560
Some of that is about

2198
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,608
Your excitement is both

2199
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,376
Yours

2200
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,168
And also anticipation

2201
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,472
Of excitement of you telling it to

2202
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,592
Thought ya even though I can see it in your eyes when you were getting excited about the

2203
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,640
The feeling you had whenever you was like

2204
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:47,968
I'm going to do my last show tomorrow

2205
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:51,296
In the moment mostly mostly because

2206
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:56,416
You immediately could tell that that was what I was asking about

2207
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,464
I feel like yeah there is

2208
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,280
Anticipation

2209
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,352
Dialects with guns

2210
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
Stillgoode

2211
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,984
I mean I guess our show is over to now

2212
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008

Foxwood begin to view the Dalek as a partner

2215
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
You know

01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,200
I understand anything from globalist X

2217
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
Stop

2218
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
And by that I mean

2219
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,528

Bulshit on his part

2226
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,848
Pathetic

2227
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,408
Coordinates on Wednesday because

2228
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,200
Holiday Inn Express

2229
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:53,760

We did one but if it started

2233
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,464
Yesterday I tried to do my last episode I really f*****

2234
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,256

01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,144
I will do my real life would be great I would give anything for him to do a whole week of

2236
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:15,520
Each time I thought I did better but you know what

2237
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
Third time's a charm

2238
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,128
I realize in hindsight is embarrassing dope David icon for an hour and

2239
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,432
Make his ass on the last show and I

2240
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,760
By all accounts think he's a total weirdo

2241
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,552
Hey where do this again

He got mad that he didn't get the call

01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,048
So we're going to do it from the top

2247
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:44,192
It is it is fitting if they also got to feel bad that he wasn't on the last year

2248
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:49,056
