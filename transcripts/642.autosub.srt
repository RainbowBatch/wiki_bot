1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

The King of the South to clean South not the Dirty South

00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
The Dirty South

00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Who's that

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Oh okay

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248

Master P is the Court Jester of the Dirty South by do not appreciate that at all

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
The ice cream man's going to f*** you up

14
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm just making a weird all right. You're just like a Pete Holmes

15
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Oh yeah it'll be fun

16
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Quick question for you

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
Whatsyourprice

18
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
Bag breaks Twitter just as weird

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
Starting to record this episode

20
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,760
That apparently the Mighty Mighty Bosstones have broken up after many many years

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Are there 20 years after I remember them last years and years.

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Plaid

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
They've decided to hang up the old

24
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Skanking shoes

25
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,632
Well do I mean it's obviously on the one hand I am big fan

26
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
I have been

27
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,008
Course it's my my childhood although I will say I have not listened to most of their new album

28
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
I am a big fan of the earlier catalog certainly

29
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
It's bittersweet a little bit but I didn't get to see

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Stop witches

31
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,184
I guess it when it's better that then like to hear this news I guess I'll never

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Hey there are union to be able to see him at 5 p.m. at a casino someday Dan

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
And you're to be okay

34
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
Midas in Everett

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,288
But like yeah it is it it at least my my childhood self got to have that like

36
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Experian

37
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Invalidate fasting

38
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Thanks thanks Bosstones I have a similar experience in the reverse

39
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
I could have seen James Brown

40
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
It's my college girlfriend at the time

41
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
She's different

42
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
But

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,960
But for some reason I decided not to go I can't remember the exact

44
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Pacific time

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Week later he was dead

46
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Yeah right

47
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
A bummer is that that is a bummer

48
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,528
Oh no, crime

49
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,648
Sherlock Holmes hat

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Figure out this mystery

51
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,048
Absolutely I was going to be the return of saga

52
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,888
Which is the first one

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
It's about time for that day it's a really really great graphic novel

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
By Brian K Vaughan who's a really good writer

55
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
But the artwork is done by Fiona Staples and she is

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Beyond great

57
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
It was going to be that open

58
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Tuesday night the heat died

59
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
In my replace okay and I don't know if you recall it was about -8 degrees outside

60
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
Ballpark

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
1 in the afternoon

62
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
So bye-bye

63
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
Right spot is having heat again amazingly good

64
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Pillow forts blanket Saturday

65
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
This is one of the downsides like I texted you when you were going

66
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
This is part of the bad part about to homeownership

67
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
The condo and like

68
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
Now you just look at the yellow the landlord

69
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
If I know

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
And I was alone whenever the repair guy came and he was like

71
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
Do you know how old this thing is and I was like No And he was like 8

72
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Still mad at Reagan

73
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
This is not good but also Don't lecture me about it

74
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,991
Monday of this week

75
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
This past week of January 24th

76
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,647
2022 22nd

77
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
I doubt it

78
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
So this is an episode where Alex

79
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Of course

80
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
You talked about how do you talk to the January 6th

81
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Text committee

82
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
Everybody was pretty interested to hearing how that went

83
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,335
We'll figure it out

84
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
But before we do

85
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
What say hello doesn't do

86
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
The first Nick wallbank

87
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,183
Jen and Steve escapees of Ocala Florida thank you so much here and I'll probably walk

88
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,023
Blackjack

89
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
You're busted oh I get it thank you so much and I apologize

90
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
I did it wasn't part of the name

91
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,335
Like I got it that you busted but I guess I didn't realize that when I wrote down the name

92
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Clever

93
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,943
X-Files

94
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,831
Thank you very much

95
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,047
How old is my spirit animal

96
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
I have

97
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Risen above

98
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
My enemies

99
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
A little breaking for me

100
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
And then we're going

101
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
To come back

102
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
And I'm going to

103
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Start the show over

104
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
F*** you

105
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
I got plenty of words for you but

106
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
At the end of the day

107
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
F*** you and your new world order

108
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Horse you rode in on

109
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
And all your s***

110
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
Maybe that I should almost broke

111
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

112
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
5 years

113
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

114
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
And you never see me again

115
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Really what I want to do

116
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Apologized

117
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
To the crew in the Lesner Chester

118
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

119
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Better tomorrow

120
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
He may be I have no beef

121
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Thoroughly with the help. If you want to explain

122
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
You're very scandalous comments

123
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
Surprised

124
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311
This is like this is a good thing for a lot of people wow

125
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
Yeah that's right coming hard and Pete Holmes

126
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,271
Wow

127
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,623
Okay videos of Jordan do not necessarily reflect the ozone

128
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
Knowledge fight LLC

129
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Like I said today 24th at the beginning of this week news broke that Alex

130
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Did Matt virtually with the 36

131
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Committee and the buzz that was going around was that he plead the Fifth

132
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
About a hundred times

133
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,407
When I first saw the news going around my first question that I had was like what information is being used backup this

134
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Reporting

135
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
I looked around I read some articles in the mainstream media about the story and all of them just relied on comments that Alex made on

136
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
His own show

137
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,143
A source familiar with the investigation confirmed the meeting to CNN but that really just means that the meeting

138
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
Happened the other ways that Alex characterized the meeting where a cure

139
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,847
The CNN article in particular just seems like a partial transcription of Alex's show

140
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,711
And all the other articles are the same thing you just rely on Alex's show in the claims that he made on it

141
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
I guess there's not really any other information they could be going off of since I don't think that these interviews are public particula.

142
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
How about this whole

143
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Still ongoing

144
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
I'm going to cover this episode but I do with the largest grain of salt any human has ever imagined

145
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,679
Taking his word about everything he says

146
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Concerning a meeting with the house committee that he thinks is trying to overthrow the country

147
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,431
What are the biggest problems is it I don't actually trust Alex's ability to comprehend information he receives or questions he's asked

148
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
So that calls into question his telling of the thing

149
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm most interested in knowing about this meeting with the committee which is

150
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
What they asked

151
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
Knowing what they asked would help gives

152
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,999
Some sense of what direction they're heading in and what Alex should be worried about

153
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,655
Having a solid sense of that will have to wait I guess the best we've got for now is Alex's. What happened

154
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,519
So that's what we're going to go with reading some of those because

155
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,639
You know normally we

156
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
F****** everywhere and I couldn't avoid it even the headlines were showing up

157
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Read every one of them

158
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
And everyone of them might as well have been like

159
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
We're taking noted liar at face value

160
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
I do

161
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
F****** stupid I don't know if it's stupid because I think like if you're going to

162
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
Get write a story about this

163
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
Roberta's newsworthy

164
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,751
That's what you have to do but I do think a better job could have been done to really highlight

165
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,359
All this could be bulshit absolutely

166
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
Especially the day after we do deposition episode and we've done plenty of deposition episodes of the past I think we know

167
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Know how Alex talks whenever the shitz

168
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,183
Real now you know that's a good point but I also think that we do need to be careful because

169
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
The depositions are civil depositions

170
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
About a case

171
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,143
Clearly not concerned or or have any respect for

172
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
The way he might respond to talking

173
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
To a congressional committee

174
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Where he could be in legal Jeopardy

175
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
I think it might behave differently

176
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
Currently I'm not ready to make the assumption that he would behave exactly the same but he might

177
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Exactly the same but

178
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
His bombastic retelling of how he behaves

179
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Is

180
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
100%

181
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
True true

182
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
I guess that is really the point is that we don't know

183
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
We don't know

184
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
That that should be

185
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Gov Captain mind as we as we go over the stuff

186
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
So we're going to start here on the 24th

187
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
Boo from the jump

188
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,383
My friends on this Monday January 24th 2022 transmission

189
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
I just had a very

190
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Pants experience

191
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Interrogate

192
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Lawyers

193
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Air flight

194
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
But they were

195
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
Very seriously

196
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
I know that

197
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Chef is a

198
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Caught

199
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Making emails

200
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Misquoting President Trump

201
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
He is ordering

202
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
The presidential train here's a transcript

203
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
President

204
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Crane

205
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Parody version of

206
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
Scraped up a call between Trump and Ukrainian president zelensky

207
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
At the time my position like when

208
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,143
Drifted that my position was it was a bit dramatic on his part and a really bad Optical move

209
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
Easy would be to attack him just the way Alex has

210
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,591
Think that it's fair to say that he's trying to pass off what you were saying is an actual transcript

211
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
That's kind of dumb

212
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
Yeah it's really clear that

213
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,527
I bet that was not the intention to pretend that it was

214
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Misunderstanding that on purpose

215
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
So they can text you

216
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
For being a forger instead of just being a bit dramatic

217
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Is really dumb but it does provide me

218
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
Excuse for why Alex

219
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,839
The very innocent person should be afraid of testifying for the committee

220
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
He's so innocent but that doesn't matter cuz she's just going to create fake document

221
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
He did was Trump

222
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Truly fascinating that's a Alex

223
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Constantly goes on about wanting his day in court where he can be Vindicated in the establishment will have to recognize that he's been right all

224
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
How long in power will tremble before

225
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,343
But every time he has the opportunity there's some kind of excuse for why you just withstand dozen

226
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Improve anything

227
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
All the Sandy Hook depositions would have been ideal time for him to stand behind his claims

228
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
And it's very least demonstrate that even though we

229
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
We know them to be wrong now

230
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
He had reason to believe that these claims were correct when he said them

231
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
And every time he was mumbled

232
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
I don't know we're trying to change the subject rambling about how he's a Vic

233
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Now here he is testifying in front of

234
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Congressional committee and wealth

235
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,271
He could tell the big truth to power and stand up like a man in the arena like he always calls himself

236
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
Prince's fake story about Adam Schiff that's got him too worried to talk

237
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
It's such b******* this entire character he puts on his a fraud come on everybody knows cuz we've we've seen this

238
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
History in the past you know

239
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Truth-tellers have gone up against

240
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Kangaroo court so many times

241
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Because they're going up against kangaroo courts

242
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
All they really do is quit and give up because what's the point of fighting back you know there's nothing more Nova

243
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Then giving in

244
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
The powers-that-be

245
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
Yeah I think the folks

246
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
That I I think

247
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
I respect moral principles would be like well

248
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,487
I'm going to go in there I'm going to speak my peace I'm going to tell the truth and whatever,

249
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
Consequences May calm sure

250
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Do you know what the

251
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Political consequence of me telling the truth

252
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,591
Because they believe that what the government's doing

253
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Is rozzi's IV Wars

254
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
And things like that bright day off

255
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
End up having consequences and they have consequences

256
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Activism

257
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
And then you have people vertex protesters like Alex's friend

258
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Who do the opposite

259
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
That's kind of how I feel about Alex's

260
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Posture towards

261
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
You know testify

262
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
It's The Stolen Valor Valor

263
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Unlike

264
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,031
The Stolen Valor of wearing army medals and b******* when you have endured that b the The Valor of

265
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Somebody who's actually fighting Power and

266
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
They're not doing

267
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Like I said it's characters

268
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
Completely so Alex

269
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,855
He's learned over the course of his career last episode proves that is not true

270
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
My name is Adele

271
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Personally

272
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Radio Beverly

273
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
That's what power to have

274
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
And I was

275
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Really for the right reasons but I still made mistakes

276
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
And the process

277
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Trying to be good

278
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,895
Careful with the power I wield

279
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Not the normal

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Process

281
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
When the type of people that actually shipped

282
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
I'm already on TV so they can be

283
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Famous

284
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
They could get a job in Hollywood

285
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Jobs Hollywood

286
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Star-Lord

287
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,399
Because I genuinely wanted to be with the people in the common populace

288
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
My own process of learning

289
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
No I've been wrong

290
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Help Me Grow Up

291
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Really see what's wrong

292
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
What's the people that are

293
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Arrogant

294
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Hateful

295
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Disconnect from God

296
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Just ridiculous

297
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
Wow just really describe himself right there so hateful

298
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Disconnected from God

299
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
Engagement Alex my understanding of him through periods of his career

300
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
I think one of the more offensive things you can say in terms of like just

301
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Blatant disregard

302
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
For the truth is I've learned thing

303
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
The end I learn

304
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
. is alive

305
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Categorically not

306
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
Yeah I am and also disrespectful is the notion that like

307
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:59,647
I did things that hurt people but I was trying to be good in the service of good

308
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
That's such s***

309
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
I mean you know it's

310
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
It's fun

311
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
It's fun whenever he described

312
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,167
I I've learned I've changed and I've grown and

313
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,983
It's been my mistakes that have allowed me to

314
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,615
Realize what's wrong with the people in power despite the fact that he said the exact same thing about them

315
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Since he was 11 years old register is John bush

316
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
John Birch Society book

317
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
No but I think that

318
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
This is what

319
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
People

320
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:36,511
Who have learned things say and so he sort of parroting because it makes

321
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
It seem like he's actually had the experiences that he wants the audience

322
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
To feel like he's had right knee is not

323
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
He's at the opposite

324
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
Maybe he just has forgotten

325
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
How to start every sentence with

326
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
You know like maybe he actually is a parrot maybe he will

327
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
Those pages is like a parent something

328
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
Florida's office

329
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
So look

330
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,463
I was not looking forward to

331
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
To a whole episode of lesson

332
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Alex

333
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
I've had enough

334
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Basically

335
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
4 hour episodes

336
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,471
Listening I didn't want to jump rope

337
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Much like the people of Nineveh

338
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
As outfit he gave me a reprieve

339
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
Huge show lined up for you today

340
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Four-year-old daughter

341
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Camping for munch

342
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Couple days off

343
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
30 minutes

344
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
I think his daughter wanted to go to an amusement park but that trip got cancelled because Alex's financial information was reported in The Hobbit

345
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
Suppose we wanted to make a couple million dollars out of spite

346
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
I guess you wants to go camping now

347
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
Anyway Alex has been out of the studio for the last couple days after this episode and Owens been hosting which is a mess

348
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
Owens got on his plate

349
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,503
He's hosting Alex's show that has to do his show afterwards that's like 6 hours of talking

350
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Was just one hour of a break in between we're in this

351
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Gerald Celente

352
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
The 4th hour

353
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,023
There's no one on earth with 6 hours of interesting things to say in a day and is there is a person it's not Owen

354
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Sleeves half an hour into the show which gives us like

355
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Do therefore the first hour

356
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
A means to be there for half an hour

357
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
And then he's out of here he's got senioritis

358
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Today

359
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
So Alex

360
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Comes back from break

361
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,015
He reiterates that he has just got done talking to these committee lawyer

362
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Testimony via

363
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207

An interview

368
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
With the

Is it is newsworthy an important and I move on the other big-nosed and I would Troyer

00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Come in and take over because I again

Heading to the woods

376
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,655
Oh it's great time to go run to the great time to get to the woods and this also brings up

377
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
When are episode drops

378
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,567
If there is any kind of response from Alex

379
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,223
So he had some time I would be building a Pueblo if I were him I would be I would be

380
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
The Border building a redoubt

381
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,135
Meeting Andy decided

382
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Going to bleed

383
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
The fifth his reasons and his understanding

384
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
King of the cops

385
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
Constitution seem a little bit weird here

386
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
My lawyer told me almost a hundred times today

387
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
During interrogation

388
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Advice of counsel

389
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
I am starting my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent

390
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
And the media tells you

391
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
Because you're guilty

392
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Because you're going to criminate

393
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Also just because you could be used

394
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
To try to incriminate you

395
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Twist

396
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Something

397
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Against you

398
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Adam Schiff

399
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Famous for

400
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Conversation

401
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
Oh I wonder if he brought that up to Adam Schiff in the in the testimony

402
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
Answering these questions because you're a known for juror

403
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,456
That's my daughter to make sure that this was a collegial atmosphere

404
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
If you wants to relate

405
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,856
You get take things seriously deal with the reality

406
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
That boy so we're discuss the fifth amendment in a recent episode where Alex is threatening

407
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,376
But this is a very inaccurate interpretation of what that amendment allows

408
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,984
The fifth amendment allows Alex to not answer questions that he has a reasonable belief

409
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
Could be used against him in another potential case

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
For instance if you were testifying about a murder you witnessed while you were in the

411
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Middle of committing a robbery

412
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
You could plead the fifth about details of why you were there where you were Wendy Witten

413
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Misty's Burger

414
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
But you could still answer questions about seeing the murder

415
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Is against themselves

416
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,704
If Alex's interpretation of the Fifth Amendment were applied across the board the legal system in this country would collapse

417
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,288
And they're just wouldn't never be any reason to call any Witnesses

418
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
To be opposed to the goal of the investigation

419
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,944
People who had information about deeply illegal things would never have any concern about so

420
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Subpoenas because

421
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
They just bleed the fifth everything instead of risking the lying to Congress

422
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:53,184
If the standard for being allowed to use the 5th was that you were vaguely concerned about someone misusing your words

423
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
It's because of

424
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,792
Something as flimsy as a dumb misrepresentation of a years old right-wing talkin

425
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
There would be no reason to have anybody testify ever again

426
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,264
The people who get subpoenaed will have to show up

427
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
To say I plead the

428
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,104
The fifth and not answering either question

429
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
It makes everything so much more important

430
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
This is a child's interpretation of the Fifth Amendment more likely to cause him

431
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
Referred for

432
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
Contempt charges

433
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,488
Because it's just not reasonable to assume that he had a legitimate concern

434
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:32,096
That answering any of those 100 questions would lead him providing evidence against himself

435
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
In a different

436
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Potential process

437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
It's just

438
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
A bizarre misuse of the

439
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
How long have you known Stewart roast

440
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
An alternative is that Alex has an almost cartoonishly sprawling crime Empire and answering any questions

441
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Anything in his life and business work

442
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
Would lead to proof of a crime

443
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
I would guess you'd rather not that not be the impression that he sending but it's not a totally unfair reading of the accident that he's

444
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
There's an I've never met any of the people who work for

445
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,912
Wonders at a flaky legitimately did plead the fifth to all these things

446
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,800
I think it's a possibility I think it's an abuse of the amendment and take you'll probably end up

447
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
I don't think we'll get arrested or anything for it

448
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
But I do think that he could run into some kind of a fine

449
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Traffic movie

450
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,832
But like the alternative is I do see it is entirely possible that he didn't

451
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
The 5th because I don't think his lawyers would tell him to

452
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
But I mean if you have bad lawyers

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Still I don't I don't think that they would be like hey

454
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Here's here's how this thing works

455
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
The contribution but it actually doesn't work this

456
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
I'd say that if I were a lie

457
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
And I had close relationships with a lot of militia

458
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,128
I would not want to go on my show and say

459
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,200
I told the Congressional committee everything that I know

460
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,832
I told them names I gave them where they live I gave them how many guns they bought

461
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
From me I snitch

462
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Car motherfuker

463
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
Yeah I mean

464
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,912
Play the figured want to say I don't know I mean it

465
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
I guess because we don't

466
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
I have any word from any Source other than Alex

467
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
I'm not totally convinced that is actually what

468
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Totally and at the same time

469
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:24,992
If I knew a bunch of militia members I wouldn't be surprised if giving away information to the Congressional committee

470
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
Eventually wound up being a crime on my part of some sort

471
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
I know too much

472
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah

473
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
I mean

474
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,976
Disrespect

475
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
That he has

476
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,864
Farming basically all legal proceedings that are things he doesn't like

477
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
You can't walk in

478
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Something like that

479
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
People like that

480
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
I don't know if they're good people

481
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
They can always polite nice

482
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
In the background

483
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,136
Moray eel in the Rocks ready to come out and eat you

484
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Then there's no reason to even

485
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Because it's

486
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
You can see here I'll Alex operate

487
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
Any case that's inconvenient for him or that is illustrating the negative space that he lives in will always be determined to not be

488
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Illegitimate

489
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,056
There's so many stupid conspiracies and right-wing talking points Alex

490
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,640
Can fall back on so anytime he's looking down the barrel of consequences

491
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,016
He couldn't pull out one of these and try to save face to the audience for the way he coward instead of engaging with the process

492
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,624
You got this made-up story about Adam Schiff so this comedian this committee's illegitimate

493
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,512
He's decided in his head that he followed all the discovery processes in the Sandy Hook case so that default judgment is it legit

494
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
None of these cases are illegitimate at all what they actually already threatening

495
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
Dalek so he needs to delegitimize them to his listeners

496
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Leslie realize the scam

497
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Some studies running

498
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Right and that's

499
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
That's the how the

500
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
Kelly the Cabbage trial that Alex

501
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,040
See his legitimate is Benghazi hearing aids

502
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
He was charged with being

503
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Too much of a hero

504
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Right

505
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
The most hero anybody's ever been and they were like that

506
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
Crime scene

507
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
You're safe too many lies

508
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,752
Our Stars people their questions are

509
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,872
Stop

510
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
The questions were

511
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Pretty reasonable

512
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
I wanted to answer.

513
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
But it's

514
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
It's a good thing I didn't because

515
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
Making them cry to climb to that perjury

516
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
Cuz about half the questions

517
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Planning things

518
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
From memory

519
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:05,248
Namek is describing with how he answers questions he doesn't actually know anything about that Rings true to me

520
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
Deposition appearances Weaver

521
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:13,952
It's not even trying to be helpful though it's an attempt to Spin A Yarn that explains everything even if that requires make

522
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Things up

523
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
It's what he does on his show it so it's not

524
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,840
Surprising that you carry that over into legal settings as well

525
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
You've never

526
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,192
Respect for any case where he possibly accused of wrongdoing it.

527
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Fixies above-the-law so

528
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
Why would you give a s*** about answering questions accurately

529
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
Accuracy is not important

530
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Utility is

531
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
And making up stories that

532
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
I guess

533
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
Kind of explain what people are asking about

534
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Call utility

535
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,136
I have some questions about whether or not Alex had seen the emails he's referencing here

536
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,976
Without knowing what the emails are it's hard to tell if they're things that he could have missed but

537
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,816
I get the sense that Alex claiming to not use email personally is a strategic

538
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Position so you can always claim ignorance

539
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,472
If he's ever asked about it drives you that email

540
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
LOL

541
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Want to come

542
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,872
Winky face

543
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
So Alex has their question

544
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Guess

545
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
It's not a good idea

546
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
To read the questions questions

547
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
For sure

548
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Fix that might be not

549
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Cool

550
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
But I don't know

551
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Because of

552
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
Oh my God

553
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
Dysentery

554
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
That work

555
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,016
I if you define things like this I can't imagine a corporate feeding that Alex couldn't claim was too risky for him to answer

556
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Jensen

557
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
If it wasn't a fake concern about Shane if it would be another Congress

558
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
Person who had some kind of conspiracy about them

559
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
It's not a real concern it's a cookie cutter fill-in-the-blank excuse for why Alex isn't standing up and taking on the system

560
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,168
Even though he insists he's totally innocent you being set up and he has all the truth on his side

561
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
This is kind of like how children rationalize situation

562
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Threatening to there

563
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,616
It feels like a kid who thinks that they're really good at basketball

564
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
Explain that they didn't even try out for the team because the coach doesn't like their dad

565
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,040
It's an excuse to not have to confront the reality that metaphorically

566
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:20,416
Alex isn't good at basketball

567
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
That's the vibe

568
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah it would really make him look

569
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
Lesser than in the eyes

570
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
His his

571
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
Inferiors sec

572
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,008
This is assuming that he actually did plead the right

573
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,848
So are you telling me that he is going to read these questions

574
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
And then give the answers that he would have loved not really not real okay he will get around to like address

575
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,624
Sing a couple of them go down the list which is unfortunate I would have liked that

576
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
Information

577
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
The couple will get to those when he does

578
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
Before that Jesus

579
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
This

580
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Tumi

581
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
If true

582
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Is bad news.

583
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
That word

584
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
They have everything that's already on my phone since

585
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Thanks cuz I saw my text

Caroline ran and Cindy Shaffer

588
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
If you wanted some of the event organizer

589
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
And they already know I didn't do anything that wasn't playing any violence

590
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Was even talking about

591
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Nearby should be peaceful

592
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:31,328
If they have that that you got to assume maybe they have even more

593
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,704
You know Alex they don't they don't have to give you everything they know yet

594
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
In the in a trial right

595
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,152
They will have to give you a call Discovery you've heard of it I mean you haven't really heard of it honestly is heard

596
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:50,016
He's perfectly familiar with the concept yeah I think that

597
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,880
It would be tough for me to believe that there aren't at least

598
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
A couple of

599
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Weird

600
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,536
Messages between Hammond like Ali Alexander Stewart

601
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
You know I don't

602
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Obviously I wouldn't know what's in that

603
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Crossover

604
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Stephanie Mills

605
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
I'd love to get my hands on that

606
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
I would really assume

607
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:17,408
And again we've we've talked too much about Alex's legal proceedings but I would really assume that they are key

608
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
Keeping things away from Alex's knowledge

609
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
In the early going

610
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,808
Yeah I mean I think you're a good strategy with him is

611
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
Absolutely not making clear what you know

612
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
Maybe he'll be able to do his thing where he comes up with a fake explanation for why everything is fine

613
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
Haha but he's going to do that anyway so if you let him do that with a

614
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:42,240
False or incomplete understanding of the information that you know you can set a trap for him

615
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:47,360
Maybe he would like to repeat that for everything because

616
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
His behaviors are self

617
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Doubt self

618
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah

619
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
I mean I feel like if I was

620
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
If I was those lawyers I

621
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Just flattered the s*** out of Alex

622
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Jason just be like man

623
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,744
If you had full power over all of these people I'm sure you would have directed them to stop and none of this would have ever happened

624
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
Since you didn't have full power over them

625
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Which you should have

626
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Because you're

627
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
So

628
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Great butts

629
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:15,776
Since you did just let me know what you did do you know because I know I'm telling you it was all good I'm sure it was all good

630
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
Cuz you're the best in the spire.

631
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
And tell me what you were doing and what Stewart roses doing

632
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,904
So there's one particular thing that apparently they asked Alex about

633
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
That actually fine

634
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Fascinating

635
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
And that is

636
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
Full segment on his

637
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,608
December 31st 2020 show

638
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
I did not know a lot of the questions I asked

639
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
Fiend

640
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
And II

641
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Once they sent me the subpoena a few months ago

642
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
I was shocked by

643
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Because I never seen Matt Bracken

644
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Recall for things like that he was always

645
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Opposite

646
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Look out for federal

647
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Plants

648
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
6 days before January 6th

649
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
He's basically

650
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Call

651
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
But he wasn't there that day he was up to.

652
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
Washington Monument give you if you believe

653
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Whether he's

654
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
Or whether he just got

655
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
Hell no I don't support that

656
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Weather

657
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:54,336
I guess I guess it turns out Matt Bracken was

658
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
Afbi plant

659
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,200
Wow Infowars Heap cover

660
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,528
Provocateur this whole thing

661
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
For the last eight years 30 years at least all of those things that I

662
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
Alex loves so much

663
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
Was a desire to overthrow the government

664
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,352
Figure out what it is

665
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008
Has been a longtime consistent fourth our host on Alex's show

666
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,848
At least 2016 entries but was almost like David night even

667
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Before that

668
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
June 17th

669
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
2021

670
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
His appearance is just

671
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
Why

672
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,392
Bracken was also a publisher as a blogger on the website America

673
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
Can partisan with bylines going back to 2020

674
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
And then he has no more post

675
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
After July 2021

676
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,192
Watershed he's not dead which I can assume based on his consistent posting on Gap up until even today

677
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
What happened

678
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Here's a guy with an a

679
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
Accomplish resume and Alex clearly trusted enough.

680
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
Close out the last show of 2020

681
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
You just disappear

682
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
I don't want to get to

683
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,832
Conspiratorial at this but it does come to mind that the January 6th committee was formed on July 1st

684
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,672
2021 resolution to form it was introduced in the house

685
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
On June 28th 2021

686
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
I would think hey

687
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,704
What's going on hey here's a guy who's been on your show for years and hears

688
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
He said I hate everyone

689
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
Storm the capitol on December 31st

690
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
Show and then he

691
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
When's committee came around

692
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,992
He's gone you I haven't bought any more

693
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,088
I don't know if there's any relationship with that but I would ask him about it just

694
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,136
In case it made him feel weird

695
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,768
So I thought of going camping episode

696
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
Bracken actually said

697
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
December 31st 2020 episode of Alex

698
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
He's hosting the 4th hour and

699
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,008
I honestly think it's a fairly standard my bracket appear

700
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,824
It's a lot of blustery talk about a revolution

701
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,664
Whatever is the Hot Topic in extreme right-wing circles at the time

702
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,992
That's kind of his thing and what he always does on Infowars

703
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:14,624
If the main issue was something about racial Injustice he'll insist that a race war is right around the corner

704
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,000
If it's gone paranoia narratives that are on top of insist they're about to take your guns and you need to be ready to kill

705
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
People to stop the rise up

706
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:26,656
If it's an election conspiracy that's getting the most traffic he'll do a video as he did in 2021

707
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
Where do you says it's either the ballot box or the Bullet

708
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
And if it's a big Patriot theme protest that he wants to amplify it's not a surprise that he will be using extremely irresponsible

709
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Audible an inflammatory line

710
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Excuses to Infowars Alex

711
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Knows that

712
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
It's

713
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:47,392
Just at the s*** he's fear-mongering about the past hasn't come true and unfortunately this time

714
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
He straight-up looks like a prophet

715
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,744
But the wrong kind of profit for Infowars

716
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,656
The kind that makes it look like they were really excited about it promoted the idea that if things didn't go their way on January 6th the right-wing would need

717
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Need to take over the capitol

718
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
Anyway let's dive in here

719
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
With other man himself

720
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,176
Matt Bracken actually it the beginning of this report he explains why he's wearing no

721
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
You know I'm I'm

722
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Where in the Infowars

723
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Shirt right there today

724
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
I'm not a member of the Infowars

725
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,440
Of the Infowars team in any kind of a

726
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Financial sense

727
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Never been paid

728
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
Doing this for my home in Florida

729
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm wearing

730
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Because

731
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,936
I'm proud to stand with Alex

732
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
And the Infowars family

733
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
Michigan pulling into a new year

734
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
You know we're going to do this stuff is

735
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
Fuel rally next week and we don't know how it's going to turn out

736
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
But there's a real serious

737
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
Biden and Harris are going to be

738
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
President

739
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Vice president

740
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Obama will be

741
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Excuse me a mile or so away

742
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,976
In his basement of his

743
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Washington Mansion

744
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Feeding therapy

745
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
Scripts to them as he is said to

746
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Set on TV

747
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,728
He'll be happy to just be the guy putting the words into the earpieces

748
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
So we know what's coming

749
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,688
The brackens wearing the shirt out of solidarity with with him

750
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,040
They should unionize the store that our Host this is why you get money

751
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Okay

752
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
You make sure you get money

753
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,928
Don't respect you unless you try and grip back

754
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
He's selling his books

755
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
And stuff like that

756
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,840
Much wider audience I need have access to otherwise

757
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
You want a financial relationship

758
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,728
That can be on the record without her

759
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
Cuz then you're more likely to get protection he's doing this for exposure though

760
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,968
I'm actually not a hundred percent sure that there is

761
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
Financial relationship

762
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,368
Without any kind of evidence I have no idea what that

763
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,696
The idea that Alex would like people

764
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:02,304
Host an hour of his show without some kind of involvement

765
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,888
But yeah so we've we've got this explained

766
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
Prada shirt

767
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
It's not suspicious he's not a antifa false flag actor

768
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,824
I'm so he he talked a little bit about what his hopes are

769
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
Before the March

770
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
Deeply ironic

771
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
I'm going to Washington next week

772
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,344
I hope it's such a big rally that it's impossible to find anybody that

773
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
You know that'll be a cfp

774
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
People that's my hope

775
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
That's my goal

776
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
But

777
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
All of the anonymous anklebiters

778
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Bet that.

779
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
You know what

780
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Hack away at Alex

781
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
Let me tell you the man has been

782
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,752
A fearless leader now for many years

783
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
And he hasn't

784
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
When it would have been easy

785
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
It would have been so easy at various points in the last

786
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Couple of years

787
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
You know what I've had it

788
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
I'm just going to

789
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
I've done my part

790
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
I've done more than my

791
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
I'm going to exit

792
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Stage left

793
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Just live a quiet life

794
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
He didn't do it

795
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
Just like Donald Trump didn't do it

796
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
A couple months early on that

797
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
Alley Boy

798
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Recently

799
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Talk a lot about Clinic

800
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
Yes we want to see you people

801
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
Just fine I'm still in the ballpark of like I just want a big protest and I would like to not be identified at that

802
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
A protester I'd like everybody to be able to blend I would like this

803
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,576
Two features zero Waldo

804
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
So next week

805
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
On January 5th and

806
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
What we have to do is show

807
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Who's really a

808
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Control

809
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Control

810
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Social media

811
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
We don't have all of these

812
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
Oregon Zoo

813
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Power

814
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
We don't control the Department of Justice we can't

815
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Decide

816
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
What criminals

817
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Will go uncharged

818
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
And what innocent

819
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
People will be arrested in the middle of the night

820
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
We don't

821
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Control that

822
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
But we can overwhelm them with

823
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Sear number

824
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
And that's why

825
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
It's going to be our week

826
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Next week

827
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,207
You know we weren't around for Valley Forge we weren't around

828
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Ordering any of Americas

829
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
Darkest Days

830
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
And now we're so comfortable it's so easy

831
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Sit on the couch

832
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Play sitting on the couch is bad

833
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
Acting like that our ancestors at Valley Forge

834
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Good

835
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Oh man

836
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
It's starting to get a little iffy

837
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,015
This is the kind of language he uses

838
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
This is it I mean you can even hear him being like a little blase about it like hey what yes obvious

839
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
We're going to take the country back

840
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,863
Save-A-Lot blase effect is kind of also Matt Bracken

841
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
He's not super

842
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Excitable

843
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Right

844
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Man

845
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,775
I I would just find it so funny

846
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
If there was somebody who is just

847
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,663
Completely unaware of what was going to take place on the 5th and 6th

848
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,967
Doing a regular ass broadcast

849
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
Saying this exact s***

850
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,855
Having no idea what's going to happen and then watching it on TV just been like

851
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:12,255
Oh no

852
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,839
That he may have so

853
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
This is

854
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
Navigate a little bit worse

855
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
You get enough

856
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Turn up trumps

857
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Enough stop

858
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Bastille rally

859
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
The park on the bridges

860
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
You can bring washing

861
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
DC tour complete

862
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Stop

863
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
If they try to

864
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Prevent this

865
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Peaceful assembly

866
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
I keeping people away from

867
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
The capital

868
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
Then the people are just going to do other

869
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
And one the other side

870
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Sprague

871
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Talk some more about that but

872
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
I can't emphasize

873
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Is this is

874
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Our Moment

875
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
No we have

876
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Never been

877
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
In our lives

878
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Like we are about to

879
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
We haven't fought a war

880
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
American soil Hellboy

881
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
Since

882
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
65

883
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
We have been blessed

884
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
Star Wars have been fought over sea

885
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
In other

886
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Territory

887
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
Blessing yeah that's a blessing

888
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Couches

889
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Breakaway out of

890
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Free Adam

891
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
You know

892
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Peaceful

893
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Easy Living

894
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
And show that this

895
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Country is not going to be

896
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Stolen

897
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
By these Democrat

898
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Socialist

899
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Communist global

900
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
We're just now

901
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Not going to permit it

902
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
And next week is when we're going to show it

903
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:31,871
We're not going to Granada allow this election to go down if we're going to show it

904
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
And I just want to let anybody who's listening to this no

905
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,855
I am associated with this iwantmyname and Alex Jones has to be at the Forefront

906
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:47,743
This exact thing that I am saying for posterity

907
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
You're already

908
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,607
Suggesting things like we could put a blockade around

909
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:57,215
If they don't let us near the Capital One nearby other thing here

910
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
To do we should have caches of weapons

911
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
Nearby don't bring them directly into d.c. that's a far greater federal crime that it would be if they were outside of the city again

912
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:11,551
Be clear that I don't think of this is out of the ordinary for Bracken at all they sometimes on the show

913
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,391
Close to normal it's just that unfortunately

914
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,743
You have to do other things that was the problem.

915
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,839
Obviously has to do with the audience

916
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,911
And the people who are there have been whipped into such a frenzy

917
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
With these

918
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,495
Consistent arguments that the election have been stolen

919
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
It's proven

920
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
And all that and so

921
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Bracken brings

922
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
Some of that up any as an interesting source that I'm not sure I've heard Alex use

923
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
There's no question that

924
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
That

925
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Pens

926
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
Thousands

927
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
The balance in the states

928
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
For counterfeit

929
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
They were they were mask

930
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Produced ahead of

931
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,511
But you look at some of these these guys like

932
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,071
This witness on the screen right now

933
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
Jovan Pulitzer

934
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
It got 200

935
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
You know involved with the

936
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,751
Human machine interface like

937
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
QR codes

938
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
He's a he's an expert on this and he says all he needs

939
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
The sea is the paper ballot

940
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,991
Javon Pulitzer didn't come up with her QR codes

941
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,319
He came up with a handheld Barcode Scanner called cuecat

942
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Right back into your 2000

943
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:23,743
The Wayward was the people would put barcodes in the newspaper like an advertisement said that this handheld device with

944
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Scan the barcode

945
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,559
And take people to their website

946
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,911
Naturally because of how Tech worked at the time that meant you had to have this cute cat

947
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,727
Plugged into your computer and then it just wasn't convenient

948
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
People did not care for it

949
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
In 2006

950
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,895
PCWorld put out a list of the 25 worst Tech products of all time

951
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
IQ cat was number 20

952
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Part of the reason for that was that it sucks

953
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
But the other part was there because there was a

954
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Huge security vulnerability that ended up being exploited and 140,000 users had their personal information still

955
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
Out of here

956
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Damn

957
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
After that

958
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,095
Future went on to run a bunch of other scams like selling crystals

959
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,679
Have you featured in The History Channel show as a treasure hunter

960
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,591
The 2020 election was the flame that attracted all the grift moths opiates are showed up and now he's a forensic ballot

961
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
What expert

962
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,967
And because these dumb dumbs like Bracken do care who sang something if they like with being said

963
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
He was accepted as an expert

964
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,599
Advocates

965
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
The capitol because the Alexa

966
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Was stolen

967
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
I think it's funny to see that

968
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
That progression of like

969
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
He makes

970
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
An invention that

971
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Makalapa

972
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Suitability

973
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
Which not high

974
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
I understand

975
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
However

976
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
A legitimate invention

977
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,383
Barcode reader computer in 2000s pretty good

978
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
Bright

979
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:52,063
I guess your next move is treasure hunter that's a long dropped out that the crystals were after that then

980
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
I don't know.

981
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,671
The lucrative Market

982
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Selfer quite a bit

983
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
So look the elections been stolen

984
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
Pulitzer sold us this we all know it

985
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
And if you allow that to stand

986
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
There's any consequences in the future

987
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Folks

988
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
You let

989
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Happen

990
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
Bet it's on you

991
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
Future generation

992
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Things will say

993
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
You just didn't

994
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Really give a damn

995
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,991
They stole the

996
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Not even hiding it

997
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
So you have to act

998
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
Now our time is the six

999
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
If you don't

1000
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,999
Future generations and posterity will know you as a person who didn't give a s*** about Liberty

1001
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,863
So tired high-stakes I'm interested in this question

1002
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
If you like and were stolen

1003
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
Is he right

1004
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
You know I'm saying

1005
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
What are bigger issues that the election wasn't actually stolen

1006
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,711
I mean that's obviously a very large

1007
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:58,111
Biggest issue the terminology election being stolen is way to Vega to even real

1008
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:04,511
What does it mean if there is like an actual installing of a person

1009
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
I'm sure then

1010
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,583
No I still

1011
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
I don't know then it becomes murky about whether or not

1012
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
Application for those action

1013
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:19,359
It would have been Justified

1014
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Greg area of

1015
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,199
Even though you could make a linguistic

1016
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
And actually like

1017
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
Fairly decent argument

1018
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
That bush

1019
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,855
Was put in office by the Supreme Court

1020
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:36,255
I don't know if that if that justifies trying to overthrow the government

1021
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
The Supreme Court

1022
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
Possibly

1023
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Making some

1024
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Pretty

1025
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Sirius overhauls

1026
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Make sure these kinds of situations

1027
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,335
Don't happen again

1028
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,943
I think you raise an interesting question that I don't really have a full answer

1029
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
That I think that people

1030
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
Open Puzzle over that

1031
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,855
You do is it like there's a part of me that is

1032
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,183
Not in admiration for bye

1033
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
By any stretch

1034
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
By any stretch

1035
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,535
But of of that like

1036
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
They

1037
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Follow through

1038
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
You know like if if

1039
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,751
What he's saying is true and this is what he thinks is the correct response to that

1040
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Then they did it

1041
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Which is a

1042
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
A different thing from so many other people who are like

1043
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,455
Here's the biggest problem and this is what we should do about it and I'm going to

1044
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:33,599
You know sure there's a difference there that I I recognized and I don't necessarily think his

1045
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Good price

1046
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,463
I think what you're talking about is a fairly abstract

1047
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,791
I want to bring it back down to the ground to tiny bit because

1048
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:48,959
Is provided for why they think the election is stolen is so flimsy as to

1049
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Very

1050
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,031
Clearly

1051
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Indicate that

1052
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,847
There isn't a conviction that there is

1053
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
Is it true that the election was stolen

1054
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:03,551
It's a conviction that they didn't get the outcome they wanted and so any explanation for why it is stolen

1055
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
Enough for them to be like I can look at that

1056
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,303
Imagining the alternative scenario we're like

1057
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
But let's imagine

1058
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
Evidence that Trump stole the

1059
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
Do you think that they would be doing this

1060
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Do you like

1061
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
Trumpet stolen the election

1062
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,967
They were not present

1063
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
They would use the opportunity to make sure all elections were stolen from then on out right now it's it's

1064
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,719
How come was not what they wanted to flimsy evidence like this Crystal weirdo

1065
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:48,351
Treasure hunter astronaut created one of the worst Tech Adventures of all time

1066
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
This is good enough to be listed as part of the evidence that the electric was absolutely stolen

1067
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Truth is a sort of

1068
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
I hunt it

1069
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:03,455
So now that we have this all this this groundwork of

1070
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
If you don't act future Generations will

1071
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,575
Condemned it'll be damned to the the history

1072
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,647
Tommy Bracco just really sucks up

1073
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
You were knocked

1074
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
Be saved by anybody above us

1075
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
We're going to only be

1076
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
Be saved

1077
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Buy million

1078
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
American

1079
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Moving to washing

1080
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,447
Occupying the entire area

1081
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
Necessary

1082
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,775
Storming right in

1083
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
The capital

1084
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
No there

1085
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
We know the rules

1086
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Engagement

1087
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
If you have enough

1088
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
People

1089
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
You can push

1090
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Euro wall

1091
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Oh that's not good

1092
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
What if not enough paper

1093
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
Patriots show up

1094
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Then we're just going to watch

1095
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Our freedom

1096
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
Down the drain

1097
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
It is a little shocking at Hughes

1098
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Is the term storming

1099
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
Good

1100
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
Not good

1101
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,959
I would I would not want to be in front of the Congressional committee and have them play that for me to be like

1102
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
Now that's taken out of context

1103
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
Nord Network

1104
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
I didn't know it happened to people people call for stormy the capital on your network and you're not even aware of

1105
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,759
Never even listen to Infowars it by Terry life

1106
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:15,135
I got to go

1107
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,695
For 30 years

1108
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
You have to stop

1109
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
Desertification of the elect

1110
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
No matter what

1111
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
Spheal and Alexa

1112
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
Right in front of

1113
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
1 videos

1114
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
With hundreds of thousands

1115
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Bella's

1116
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
Counterfeit ballet

1117
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Fake names

1118
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,919
People that don't exist

1119
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
And we can

1120
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Stop it

1121
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
You really

1122
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
Think we'll ever have another

1123
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
Free election in this country

1124
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Do you think they'll give us a

1125
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
The chance to come back and

1126
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
2 years and push the

1127
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
The Democrats out

1128
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,255
Next week is a

1129
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
The pivot in

1130
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
In American history

1131
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Next week

1132
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
We are going to stand up and

1133
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Free America

1134
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Or we are just going to

1135
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
Pretty back to wear sofa

1136
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
Watch our country turn into

1137
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
To Ameri Zoella

1138
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
Lose our freedom

1139
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,407
Wow I like that

1140
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Amerizon wailer

1141
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,807
Brutal the mixture between America and

1142
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487
Really have all of the

1143
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,815
Serta pieces in place to really be like you have to do this

1144
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
You know something

1145
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,679
Sometimes I think part of why they get so amped up

1146
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,751
Is because they would much rather have an enemy that

1147
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
Actually seems to be fighting back

1148
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
You know like the Democrats

1149
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,175
Open more masturbating at the thought of getting kicked out in 2 years

1150
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,247
They were like all we won't have to do anything

1151
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,367
There's an interesting Dynamic that Bracken also brings got a clip of his butt

1152
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,463
Talks about the Republicans in office and being the Washington generals

1153
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,863
Store like happy to just lose all the time for a Globetrotter that are the Democrat

1154
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,959
Squirrels Nancy Pelosi Meadowlark

1155
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
You talking about Democrats

1156
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,823
Are not doing ball trick

1157
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,871
Study on people

1158
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,431
They're they're throwing water at people ridiculous

1159
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,551
So I think that we have a whole lot here in terms of establishing like

1160
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
Call to action

1161
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,159
Specific things like blocking Washington

1162
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:28,511
Storming the capital is being things that you need to do if you don't get your way in terms of blocking

1163
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
The certification of the election right

1164
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
A January 6th is the opportunity

1165
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
And the only

1166
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,679
Chance we have

1167
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Stop.

1168
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Is a mess

1169
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
Mobilization

1170
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
Next week

1171
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
If we don't

1172
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
See a million

1173
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
People in wash

1174
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Washington

1175
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Oh no

1176
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Not enough America

1177
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
You scared

1178
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
Freedom just didn't matter that

1179
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,855
As long as they had

1180
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
Flix

1181
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Anaphora

1182
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
Refrigerator and

1183
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Cozy sofa

1184
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
They really

1185
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Didn't give a damn about

1186
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
Freedom

1187
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
What's the case

1188
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Then we deserve

1189
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
Everything that comes out

1190
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
I think it'd be great if

1191
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:11,775
All Americans were able to have a full refrigerator

1192
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,175
That's probably what we should be revolting about discuss those material Comforts that people

1193
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,271
Cuz we don't have the full refrigerator

1194
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Yeah

1195
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,647
I really think he's laid out a call to Arms

1196
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,023
Depressing outro to this report

1197
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
I'm going to wash

1198
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
I'm staying for the duration

1199
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
If there are debate

1200
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Staying till the end

1201
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
I don't care I've heard all about

1202
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
The hotel situation in

1203
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
Antifa and black lives matter

1204
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
I don't care I'm going

1205
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
And I hope I see you there I hope I see millions of Youth

1206
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
End

1207
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
Hope I see you again on Infowars

1208
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
Thanks for listening

1209
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Happy New Year

1210
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
Boo

1211
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
Happy New Year

1212
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,279
You know I mean I think he's got a great

1213
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Defense though

1214
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
In front of the committee

1215
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
Here's what he can

1216
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
Cuz they can play that and he'll be like

1217
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,751
You guys realize though I'm at bracket

1218
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Can and no one listens

1219
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
To me right

1220
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,383
0 people listen to me I'm Matt Bracken

1221
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,711
You could you could I mean

1222
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,295
You could argue that his views are left

1223
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
I do still think

1224
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
Like like hey hey buddy

1225
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
You're also a noted weirdo

1226
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,207
That's true you're talking about these plants like

1227
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,047
These ideas and I don't know if you'd want to call them plans but certainly like

1228
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,703
Seems like you've thought about this a little bit before you ask me

1229
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,223
I was also pretty blustery stuff and honestly

1230
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
Just wanted it to

1231
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:02,623
Everything he was saying needed to be done was done and the only problem is that the coup wasn't success

1232
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:08,511
Tons of people showed up open today at the stopping certification

1233
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,071
And when that didn't work we will storm the capital is bracken

1234
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,375
Clearly identified as one of the necessary steps

1235
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
You could escalate to

1236
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
I'm sure that on January 6th

1237
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,799
If you had footage of bracken he would have been more excited than Harrison Smith

1238
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,847
Sing the capitol it fall into the Patriot

1239
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
Skip

1240
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
This doesn't look

1241
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:32,063
When you're cool fails in your life in the position where you publicly advocated for all the things that went into the failed coup

1242
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
You probably need to Pivot a little bit

1243
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
And unsurprisingly

1244
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,487
That's exactly what he did after this I will lyrics

1245
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
So it's pretty clear to me

1246
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Q was

1247
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
Turned into some

1248
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,119
Something that would be used as a weapon

1249
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,935
A lot of wailmer

1250
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
When do the capital

1251
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Ashley Babbitt

1252
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Underwater manga

1253
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
And I don't think they

1254
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
Johnny Quinn

1255
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
Ashley bad

1256
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
Herself

1257
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Ground

1258
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
0

1259
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
The double doors

1260
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Are the glass

1261
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Stores

1262
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Wandering around

1263
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Windfinder cell

1264
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Outside of lawn for

1265
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
At least half of the

1266
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,743
The people on that Landing

1267
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Stairs by the glass

1268
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Stores

1269
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
At least half of the

1270
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
This was a

1271
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Pure empty

1272
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Operation

1273
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
I think that

1274
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
But these guys

1275
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
I'm talking about at

1276
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Glassdoor

1277
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Ashley

1278
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
Was shot

1279
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
I think that these guys

1280
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Spothero

1281
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
The outside

1282
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Extremely motivated

1283
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Patriotic

1284
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
And thought here we here

1285
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
The kind of a

1286
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
Covid-19

1287
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Dupe

1288
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Can use as a weapon

1289
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,951
This is ranked cowardice on Brackenridge Park

1290
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:48,351
F****** distasteful so bad he acknowledged publicly advocated for the things that

1291
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,911
Light to Ashley Babbitt to be in the position she was in

1292
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
Taking the action she was taken

1293
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
When she was killed

1294
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
And because

1295
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
Admitting that is too difficult for him

1296
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,847
Raconteurs creative fantasy story about it

1297
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,175
With no proof other than his imagination he's decided that he

1298
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
It seemed a bit outside

1299
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
Patriotic

1300
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Patsy

1301
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,343
So they'll order to the doors where I guess they somehow

1302
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
Forester to try to break through them

1303
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,415
This is so pathetic

1304
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,487
It's one thing to be a fair-weather fan of a sports team

1305
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,535
Fairweather revolutionary

1306
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,839
To indicate such a lack of Spine and Pain

1307
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
Conviction it's just on except

1308
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:28,031
Matt wanted people to storm the capital he said it was a good thing to do and people did and a predictable result

1309
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,567
Got2b at antifa

1310
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Lodi

1311
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
This is very precise example of the strategy that Alex uses

1312
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,479
Bonita Alex doesn't on a grander scale

1313
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Terrorism

1314
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,343
He engages an intense and emotionally manipulative displays of incitement

1315
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,671
And then when someone does what he obviously is saying they should do

1316
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,255
That becomes an example of someone tried to false-flag Patriots to make them look the

1317
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,095
Alex is usually just smart enough to not actually say storm.

1318
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,399
The capital of the part where he's trying to incite people

1319
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
Cuz that's how the business

1320
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Continue

1321
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,775
I think understand is that this strategy has two big payoffs

1322
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,591
The first is the obvious one that it allows Alex

1323
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Some folks

1324
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,711
Captivate having to take responsibility for the consequences of their rhetoric when it actually

1325
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Comes down to

1326
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:14,623
The second is that they're able to pretend that their underlying cause was so Justified it's so important

1327
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,183
The globalist needed to use a false-flag to try to

1328
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Invalidated

1329
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,559
In this case the election was so clearly stolen that the only way to divert attention from that

1330
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:27,167
Was that this false flag which they could then blame on the people were saying the election was stolen which is

1331
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,215
Because their claims were so legit

1332
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
It's sad.

1333
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
It's very stupid

1334
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,359
It's so Universal with these dick

1335
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,407
It's one of the weirder things

1336
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
I mean

1337
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
You know it's not weird

1338
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Entirety of

1339
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,063
The Republican

1340
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Party is

1341
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
So f*****

1342
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
In terms of their heads

1343
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
Man if I really was convinced

1344
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
By all of these dumb dumb

1345
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
That the election of

1346
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Installing

1347
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
And that it was in

1348
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
Important

1349
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
To do what happened on the 6th

1350
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,215
Then to hear them do this

1351
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
Which feel like the biggest

1352
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:06,079
Betrayal like about that before

1353
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,687
Gave a s*** about the government again which is already been stolen

1354
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Like at that point

1355
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,503
It's get rid of these f***

1356
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
And cowards

1357
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
They're the ones who stopped us from winning

1358
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:22,463
Like that's that's such a f****** like if you're one of the Oath Keepers who's being charged

1359
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,583
Absolutely

1360
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,375
He's got to be

1361
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:37,055
B like it calls into question what their their motives are

1362
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,127
They were presenting to you as being hot

1363
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,479
There won't be any shirts of Alex like they're worth of Shay

1364
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:51,391
I remember Zapata coming out and being like hey man I think I think this was actually somebody else's fault they I think this is

1365
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,207
Completely

1366
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,815
I do wonder if like during those revolutionary times in the past and places

1367
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:03,167
Were there people trying to capitalize on it like Alex

1368
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,471
Were there

1369
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
Like some kind of media grifters

1370
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,871
Engaging in the same way I wonder

1371
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Pink Sober

1372
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
Because the ad think the right-wing I think the traditional way of the Griff goes the right-wing does this s*** and then

1373
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,063
Whenever the left wing

1374
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
Does the fighting

1375
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
Then the the media and everybody goes

1376
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,671
Hey this is

1377
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,207
This is wrong and you guys have to

1378
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
To stop and everybody police's the left

1379
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Sensitive

1380
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
Announce be maybe I'm not entirely sure I'd like to do if somebody had a

1381
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
Play paper on that

1382
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,055
So this is why

1383
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
I just wanted to make a reason

1384
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:48,479
The relevant thing it's not just some kind of astray

1385
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,599
I don't think there's anything really two different than the norm

1386
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,415
For my bracket reason to be aware of

1387
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
The sort of rhetoric I can use it

1388
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
When Alex interview the Q Shaman afterwards

1389
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Raccoon with his Coho

1390
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,679
He was on with him trying to create this Narrative of false flag

1391
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:13,823
So f*** all that we say that all the time

1392
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,431
That's not going to work any of the other time movie

1393
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,479
We've been trying to make this happen for years

1394
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:26,879
We've been infected with a question that they asked if this is about the pictures and video

1395
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,951
Video of him at the Georgia state capitol with Nick Fuentes

1396
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,047
Ali Alexander

1397
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,143
Station calling for the best

1398
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Do you want to go in

1399
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,031
We get our speech outside

1400
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
I do my show

1401
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
But

1402
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,199
Olly Alexander and Jones

1403
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
Peaceful

1404
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
Oh man

1405
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
When we left

1406
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,903
So that was our goal

1407
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,743
To organize that a new plan that

1408
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
Going on in

1409
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,143
Georgia

1410
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Bandsaw

1411
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
The best I can remember we just went

1412
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
Is Vernon Jones

1413
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Ever heard

1414
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
Really nice

1415
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Smart guy never heard

1416
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
Also spoke on January 2nd

1417
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
They asked me if we were with

1418
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,975
Proud boys are we leave we were with

1419
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Okay /

1420
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
Hooters

1421
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Having guy almost family

1422
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
Around my shoulder

1423
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
What we never met

1424
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,111
I don't know if Alex recognizes this or not

1425
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,463
But they're not asking about the Georgia thing for the sake of any violence or anything like that

1426
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,023
This is a question about ali Alexander

1427
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,583
Who organized this

1428
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,631
Bastille

1429
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,935
And all of the things that Ali was doing

1430
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,215
Leading up to

1431
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,311
I don't know if Alex recognizes that

1432
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
Or is being intentionally obtuse

1433
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,943
I do think that this is

1434
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,991
This is definitely one of those lines of quest

1435
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,527
Anywhere you could see Alex

1436
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
Feeling relieved

1437
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Eli call thanks

1438
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
This isn't about

1439
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
Sure I'll tell you whatever you want to hear about this George when I didn't do anything wrong there this will never come back to bite me in the ass

1440
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,559
Yes but he probably still plugged

1441
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
So they also asked

1442
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,703
The very important question of whether he had proud boy knows keepersecurity on the sea

1443
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,263
And we know that Rodger did

1444
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
Keeper security

1445
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
It's on the other hand he's not

1446
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,943
He's not one of these poor people who accept free security

1447
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
They kept you asking me do I use all keepers

1448
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
Eu's

1449
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
Cowboys' security

1450
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,463
Professional Security on not putting these people down

1451
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
But

1452
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Crowds at me

1453
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
Bus

1454
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
Ticketstorm the capital

1455
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,287
12 or 14 security people for all those

1456
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055

01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,711

We were just at a hoot

Take a hot shower

1499
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
And not even be part of the cow

1500
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,167

One Security guy

1505
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
Outside

1506
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
And

1507
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
Pictures

1508
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,047
Maybe we just won't do this

1509
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Cuz they're like

1510
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
Then all the sudden

1511
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
They come over there

1512
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Through

1513
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
We go back

1514
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Let me get let out

1515
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Oh my God

1516
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,415
The midstream

1517
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
Seeing people

1518
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:26,815
Control

1519
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,119
Moana.

1520
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
I do feel like

1521
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,039
Pleading the fifth

1522
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,623
Might be counterproductive to him at any of this is true

1523
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:55,231
Like if any of this is true then he could be like I just doing what these people told me to death

1524
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,303
If I have somebody from the Trump campaign saying

1525
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,095
Hey you should go

1526
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,911
I'll leave these people took Capital right

1527
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:07,007
I think you could maybe kick the ball down the road you know I might be smart

1528
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
Might be smart committee to be like ask them they told me to do that

1529
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,783
Of the conspiracy you understand I was used

1530
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,111
It is always fun whenever I see somebody who purports

1531
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
To be a leader

1532
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:29,535
Really sang I've never seen any of this or had any responsibility for any of this stuff at all

1533
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:35,167
I want to take a shower

1534
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,983
No I mean like okay so we had the speech at the ellipse

1535
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,335
Spam Trump was like we're going to go to the capital has the biggest

1536
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,175
Protests that have been planned forever the stop the steel shed

1537
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,735

01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
Country earlier. The steel rally

1539
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,695

About to speak

1541
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,095
My wife really wants to go so I'm going to get out of here guys anyway

1542
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:08,703
Good luck with Alex's like during the Revolutionary War

1543
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,055
Lexington and Concord sounds fun but

1544
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,079
Auto apps

1545
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,895
Some stew

1546
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,199
I could use some egg whites right about now

1547
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:25,599
Hey you guys do what you need to do

1548
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,159
L so

1549
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:31,743
Alex Alex is trying to rationalize like why you don't

1550
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,023
Engage with these

1551
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
Committees man

1552
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
I can tell you what happened here

1553
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
I just give me the bay

1554
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,935
You make one little mistake

1555
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
Talkin to that committee

1556
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
About what

1557
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Obvious

1558
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
That would convicted newborn baby and put it

1559
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Sabrina

1560
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
Eat that baby

1561
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,855
You said you can't go into something

1562
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
Baby

1563
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
Deal with something at that level of corruption I'm sorry

1564
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
You put one rat

1565
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
It's no good

1566
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
No

1567
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
Like that

1568
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
But also I would love that if like

1569
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
Young Billy

1570
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,127
You have been accused of

1571
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,527
She has no remorse

1572
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
Penalty

1573
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Exactly

1574
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:35,487
Baby out here anymore so ridiculous but still

1575
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
Yeah so dumb

1576
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
As we've already

1577
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
Kind of got the vibe of

1578
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Seems like Alec

1579
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:45,471
Text thinks that he's making his statement to the committee on his show

1580
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:50,847
Yeah where they can't prosecute

1581
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,895
To finish up my

1582
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
To the

1583
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
January 6th to me cuz I can't stand under oath

1584
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Because if I said

1585
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Behind me

1586
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,671
They would say well actually there's some black

1587
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,975
It's not really purple you lied

1588
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Present

1589
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
5 years

1590
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,583
I really wonder if there's an ability

1591
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,143
Because Alex is saying they're so like he's making

1592
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
The statement

1593
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
On his show

1594
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Use his show

1595
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
As

1596
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
Who's Satan

1597
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Why not

1598
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,943
He wasn't sworn in and you can't say that they are true but

1599
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,295
If you do know any information you can say well we know this and this

1600
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
And how he presented it

1601
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,879
And also guess what we recorded these f******

1602
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
Depositions or whatever

1603
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,207
Become under oath then

1604
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,511
If you think I'm making my statement

1605
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
Can you do that now

1606
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,887
I don't know if it's some sort of magical transitive property

1607
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Guess but I think

1608
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
Is nrcc

1609
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,055
Society for some reason cuz we live in pretend world is legally but

1610
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
Tumi

1611
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,383
That's what he's trying to convey to the audio

1612
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,503
He's like business as good as on the road I just don't trust them to be under oath for them

1613
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,063
Exactly it's just a facade it's it's

1614
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,903
Yeah I mean I already asked if you were going to say that you

1615
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,695
Didn't say anything to the

1616
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Committee

1617
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,815
And then say these are the answers that I would have given

1618
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
To the six committee

1619
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,399
I'm only doing it on my show

1620
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,983
Then that does not suggest to me that you didn't say anything to the committee

1621
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
That says you said something

1622
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
Completely

1623
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
And you don't want that information

1624
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,383
Baby baby

1625
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
I don't know it's really hard to read it is

1626
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:35,551
So I wanted to know is if Alex at heard any Rumblings of violence

1627
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Alex said

1628
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:43,999
Alex was Rumblings about his stomach was rumbling what's up with the BIOS

1629
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,303
He just thinks it was from

1630
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
Did I hear about violence and the answer is

1631
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Yeah

1632
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407

01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,639
Congress houses

1642
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,711
Breaking windows

1643
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
And so yeah that raise the temperature a lot

1644
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,087
No one around me

1647

I was doing

1648
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Logan

1649
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,535
Conservative TV and radio

1650
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,815
Civil War

1651
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
Time of the second amendment that was a

1652
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,215
But you always hear that in politics in America

1653
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
You always here

1654
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799

1656
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:12,831
Second Amendment

1657
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:17,695
The right-wing is always we always do that

1658
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
Your show

1659
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
It wasn't on

1660
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,327
Conservative radio that you heard

1661
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,119
Your ship doesn't listen

1662
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,423
I don't know about bracket

1663
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
I'm saying

1664
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:34,079
Just on his show

1665
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,615
We heard it

1666
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:42,527
What if I f****** hate these people what a bunch of frustrating

1667
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,063
So lucky doesn't want war

1668
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Unless

1669
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
Once

1670
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
Snow

1671
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
It is an information

1672
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,487
Let's get something clear for the committee

1673
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,095
Want a Civil War in this country

1674
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,935
Wallace's by anybody

1675
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,335
If you want to fight

1676
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
In the infowar

1677
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,455
Breakfast and up

1678
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,575
And say I don't know how this is going to end but if you want to fight

1679
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,135
You better believe you've got one

1680
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
Ian

1681
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,927
Leanne

1682
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,303
Infowar means we fight

1683
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
With information

1684
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
We fight with the truth

1685
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
Is this a non

1686
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,215
Violent War

1687
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
Alex Jones.

1688
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
Fine it's an information

1689
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
What's the information

1690
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,895
We will wear now people think that what we

1691
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:45,503
We did was bad information man the information is that

1692
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:50,623
The government is killing us they're going to destroy the Second Amendment and we should overthrow

1693
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:56,511
Why in this war that's all about information does Alex around with a lot of people who seem to be

1694
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,095
Involved in physical warlike Tommy Robinson or Gavin McInnes

1695
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:07,775
Girlfriend based Stickman most of whom don't have any information whatsoever

1696
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,103
Is the fight that you're bringing in the information War like what does that mean

1697
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,759
It doesn't mean anything we're propaganda to try and empty Temple

1698
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,159
So this was a shocking thing that I heard neck

1699
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,719
We did it

1700
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,767
Take the weed out of it

1701
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
And

1702
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
Replace that with Stewart

1703
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
No s***

1704
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,447
Obviously

1705
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
People followed us around

1706
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,007
Every different type

1707
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
And every different group

1708
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,687
Oscars

1709
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
He was a general

1710
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,903
Turns out you're wrong

1711
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,975
But I saw a lot of it is

1712
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
High stakes

1713
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,607
Took a lot to burning cities and try to help businesses and that's not why

1714
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,983
For most of its

1715
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Operation

1716
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
52 taking somen

1717
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
Or something

1718
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,880
Support or something I want

1719
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
Show me

1720
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
Biography

1721
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Testimony

1722
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:37,632
You've just been hit by a bus as a big ol 12

1723
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:41,984
Stupidest f****** a****** in the world

1724
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:47,360
This dude has been a guest on his show for 13 years he was working a kickoff a civil war

1725
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,944
When it didn't work out Alex had them on the show repeatedly to run cover for me

1726
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Create the narrative

1727
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,784
Didn't do anything wrong it was all set up by the left

1728
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,600
Assume that either Alex is the most in

1729
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,368
Competent

1730
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
Goebel was idiotic person in broadcasting

1731
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:05,792
Or he's feigning this ignorance on the show because he knows he can't say any of the show Underoath about looking

1732
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,072
Like a big ass liar

1733
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
If I'm Stewart

1734
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
If I'm Stewart Road

1735
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:20,384
And I have known Alex for how long I have made all of my

1736
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
Exceedingly clear

1737
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
Very

1738
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
I mean

1739
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,016
Like with bullet

1740
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
Clear

1741
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600
Maybe yeah I think that

1742
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
If you listen

1743
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,464
Stuart Rhodes is appearance on the show he's very blunt about like

1744
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,768
We need Trump to just f******

1745
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,376
Mancos

1746
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Now

1747
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,960
If I heard Alex say that

1748
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
Throughout all that time

1749
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
Get real with it

1750
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,080
He thought I was LARPing

1751
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,872
I would be furious

1752
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,920
Yes that would be the most

1753
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,248
Are you telling me that you've known me this long and you not

1754
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:02,624
Once took me seriously not one well I know because we have to actually parse this out a little bit

1755
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,720
On the 60 was LARP explain soldier in the sandbox

1756
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
But apparently he wasn't LARPing

1757
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Are playing

1758
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,120
Soldier in the sandbox whenever they would go

1759
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
Hey try and intimidate people at Social.

1760
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,008
That was knocked out

1761
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:24,640
Very serious very serious big strong men doing the right thing

1762
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,992
On the 6th whenever they start the capital and planned

1763
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,808
Conspiracy tour

1764
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:40,768
You only bring several thousand dollars worth of guns to multiple different places around d.c.

1765
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:45,376
The LARP it was a goof it was a fun time they were all made of

1766
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,912
Cardboard and foam

1767
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,240
Yeah I think I look better hope that Stewart stays in prison

1768
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:57,152
Cuz otherwise

1769
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Lipstick

1770
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,968
He doesn't find a way to bring Alex into the same

1771
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,552
We got one more clip here and

1772
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,160
I think this is really revealing about the inner conversations that were happening about the sick

1773
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,440
Within Infowars

1774
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
You know

1775
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:23,008
I was screaming at the crew and just frothing matter what a disaster it was

1776
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Fit

1777
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:38,112
We are going to make this the end of the world

1778
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,160
Martial law

1779
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
I never shut up about this

1780
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,888
That clip is so revealing

1781
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,704
Screw except extreme

1782
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,544
His buddies had done the storming but Alex was furiously rejecting that idea

1783
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,360
But it wasn't because he actually knew that they had

1784
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,640
It's because he was afraid

1785
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,688
Consequences of accepting that they had

1786
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:07,552
Opposition to the notion that the Patriots store in the capital wasn't based on fact or evidence

1787
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
It was routed only

1788
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,160
Fear that if everyone realize that they had done it

1789
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,768
It would lead to negative consequences for people associated with that community of right-wing extremist

1790
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,304
That's cute understand

1791
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,168
Alex needed to make up a story to evade responsibility and try to provide cover for right wing

1792
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
Extremism

1793
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:30,336
Then that's his goal in the information War he wants to lie

1794
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,736
Try to escape consequences what don't you understand about being the tip of the spear

1795
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:43,392
I've been I've a lot to learn trailer

1796
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,952
Is a good idea better turn around and then leave

1797
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,280
The tip of the spear pokes people in money flows out

1798
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,608
That's about right

1799
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:55,680
Beer blames another sphere

1800
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,472
Is that Halbert over there

1801
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
I really think

1802
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:02,080
Halberd halberd halberd

1803
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,384
The medieval axe

1804
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,432
Wordplay so

1805
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Clippers jersey

1806
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
So

1807
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,296
Indicative of how his mind works

1808
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:17,696
It's it's not about we didn't do this it was about the consequences of recognizing that if we

1809
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
We have

1810
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,072
Yep Bergen ever going to stop talking about this help so we cannot possibly accept

1811
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
Is being a conclusion

1812
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,424
That people are allowed to hear and except

1813
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,240
And we have to muddy The Narrative soon enough

1814
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,008
That it

1815
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,312
It can never be taken away concrete

1816
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,920
Metaphor is very much in play will never be taken away

1817
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
We will always

1818
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,528
Always always believe that it had they had nothing to do with

1819
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:47,392
I didn't see that in the immediate reaction after the 6 the way that it was a

1820
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:53,792
Mad Dash to invalidate blame everything always angry with blacklivesmatter goons dressed up

1821
01:25:54,048 --> 01:26:00,192
Buddy but they're dressed up like Trump supporters and that's why it looks like Trump supporters are doing that's why you can see people like Matt

1822
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:05,824
I can immediately and validate everything that he had been talked about for your believe in order to

1823
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,664
Just aggressively get in place this narrative

1824
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,200
Because otherwise

1825
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Their worldview is f***

1826
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:19,136
If we get the consequences of their rhetoric becomes too obvious totally too many people and just like

1827
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,672
After the Oklahoma City bombing

1828
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,232
People start to take this s*** seriously again

1829
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:26,816
I don't know who it was you who made this point is like

1830
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,120
For a long time it was

1831
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
More

1832
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,984
Convenient and easier to just ignore these assholes

1833
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,056
We learn over and over again in society that like

1834
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
All right it is no longer

1835
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:42,688
The Tipping Point has been reached is no longer expedient to ignore them

1836
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,992
There is a danger that this present

1837
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
I think that Alex and always

1838
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
Dickhole friends recognize that

1839
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:54,720
After this evil allowed to be seen for what it was that point would be reached

1840
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,072
And they'd fight against that in the information War

1841
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
I guess

1842
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:07,520
No no no never going to get away with it I don't know if I call Stuart low-level

1843
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,592
I mean I mean low-level in the sense of like ground troops

1844
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:16,736
You know what I'm saying sure the media figures that's the way this is

1845
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
Starting to look

1846
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:23,904
I don't know if Alex is going to get in any kind of like serious legal trouble but I think that

1847
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,488
From the sense I'm getting some of these questions that they're asking of

1848
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
Appear to be like

1849
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
Pretty good

1850
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
Yeah no they do I think

1851
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
I think

1852
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,400
That really xxxx

1853
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,704
Excavating

1854
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:43,104
The connections between The Oath Keepers who are hanging out with everybody right now that you have that indictment in place

1855
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,944
The security that they were providing for people and how's that interact with

1856
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,504
The planning of the stop the steel folks

1857
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
I think

1858
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
I think you got

1859
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
You got something weird people

1860
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,672
People are something to be worried about more than I thought

1861
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
Yeah we'll see we'll see

1862
01:27:59,232 --> 01:27:59,744
This

1863
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,768
Episode

1864
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,864
I take not seriously at all except for the ways in which

1865
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,656
Alex is revealing Houck

1866
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Cooperative

1867
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
I don't think that I

1868
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,264
Know for sure whether he plead the Fifth

1869
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,288
I don't know whether

1870
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:15,872
Turkey

1871
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,968
And we'll learn more as more information comes out it's still relevant

1872
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,504
Direct knives away

1873
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,552
He covers things up the way he makes

1874
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
Excuses for himself

1875
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
A 10

1876
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:32,000
I am if I didn't answer any questions it's totally justified has an illegitimate committee run by a Forger

1877
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
It's nonsense

1878
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,584
He's a coward

1879
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,912
That's so f***** up to me because it's like

1880
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
I almost want to be like

1881
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,824
With right-wing people are going to be like hey before we even talk about being right wing

1882
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Whatever you believe

1883
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
F******

1884
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,664
You're entitled to it but

1885
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,224
This guy's a giant Howard just don't follow him

1886
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,760
You know like follow

1887
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:59,904
Follow another piece of s*** s*** let me clarify let me qualify that

1888
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,184
Don't go with a knot

1889
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:10,144
I don't want any of that s*** anywhere near me

1890
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,936
Articulate what you're saying

1891
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:18,336
Recognize the ways in which this guy's a coward and using false information in order to enable his cowardice and his business

1892
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:23,200
Learning experience for you

1893
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,504
Anybody else you're considering following

1894
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:31,392
Debuts that kind of thing screwed me about what they're up to know if you can see if you can

1895
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
Define better sources of information

1896
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,464
I mean it's just that

1897
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
That like listen

1898
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
It could not get

1899
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Any more clear

1900
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,704
They will incite you they will lie to you they will try and get you to commit the worst crimes they will have you on

1901
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,520
On your

1902
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,568
And then they will let you die

1903
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,616
And tell people that it was

1904
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,712
Nothing to do with them they will let you go to prison they'll say they never

1905
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,552
I heard of that type of behavior rear end you will be abandoned

1906
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,088
In a heartbeat if it is

1907
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,368
Expedient for them

1908
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,160
That's what I want no leader

1909
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,024
And I think

1910
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,376
I'm interested to learn more but I don't think I know anything at this

1911
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,008
Website.com

1912
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,848
That's we're also on Twitter or fighting I go to bed

1913
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,944
But until then

1914
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
The sex robot

1915
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
Alex

1916
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,696
Birthstone colors
