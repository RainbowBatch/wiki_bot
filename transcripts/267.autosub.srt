Jordan

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,480
What's the longest you had to go without hot water

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
I don't know

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,416
I mean I've been in the woods for a couple days

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
Like that

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
But even those times

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
You know you could go

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
A ways away and find a shower

11
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
But I still think

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
Maybe I don't know I've never camped in the woods

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
No

14
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,184
It's like living in a hotel you bring your own

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
For the summer my parents and I drive across country to visit in California

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Paper Hotel

National Park

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
And stuff like that

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,176
KOA

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
I was just like I wanted a f****** hotel

21
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
Because

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
Today's weather

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
On the road or sewing

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
Can tired of these campsites

25
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
As we go to a KOA place

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
He's all excited about

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
This is

28
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
This is great isn't it

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,496
There's a little bit of that

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
Behind some bushes

31
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,968
That is a great mall

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
Not a

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,600
You got really sour about that

34
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Can't play

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072

VI Campground oh that's that's

37
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
That's scarier than you think

38
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
12

39
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
Everybody likes to think of like Bullwinkle

40
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Real moose

41
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Let me walk that back

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Apartment now with

43
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
Very inconsistent hot water

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
I think I kind of been living for two years about the table at least not on demand

45
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
Topgolf

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
The building

47
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
We talked about water

48
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
Alex Jones

49
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,936
Going to be some fun but before we get to it shut up

50
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,080
And are supporting the shows

51
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Your nail policy walk

52
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504

53
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm a partner for Master P

54
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Could have been one of the No Limit soldiers

55
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
Nothing much

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Famous

00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Hot dogs

00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Nathan thinking responsible

59
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
I'm a policy wonk

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,312
Thank you very much

61
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Exactly

62
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
Finally

63
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
I appreciate it also very much

64
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
You are now

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Don't get mad until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of

66
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
I don't want

67
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
If you're out there listening music

68
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
My book I don't know what a rock or a bark

69
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
Attendance

70
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
Please do

71
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,519
I was just going to Barrel through December 16th

72
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
2012

73
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Hey because the 15th was out what his narrative was going to be

74
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
I know

75
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
It would be wrong to say anything to definitive

76
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,951
But yourself

77
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Figure out where he was going to land on

78
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,143
Who's all the arrows pointing to Bugs Bunny and nothing helps

79
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Resolve that sort of thing like a day off

80
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
We're going to come in

81
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
You going to have

82
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
His narrative together

83
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
I will find out if that's the case

84
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Episode

85
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,991
I opted not to do present-day episode mostly because they don't

86
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
I don't care

87
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
I just assumed you did a Bernie Sanders impression

88
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Really

89
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Have a whole lot of intellectual curiosity

90
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
Or even narrative puncturing curiosity about whatever he's doing now

91
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Like if Rodger actually goes to jail early we might check in

92
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
The present but he just does not hold as much interest

93
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Like priority to me

94
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
If some of these other things

95
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
And we aren't

96
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
We are not

97
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
Tubi

98
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
Whatever's happened

99
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
We can't be following in his wake

100
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
If we want to do

101
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Do the show we want to do

102
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,447
So where do we go

103
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
We will do present-day episodes

104
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,871
Next week this is what I'm so much more

105
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
Right now and

106
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:49,087
Where I spent more of my time

107
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Just all

108
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
Cancel

109
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,655
Pipe gave this caveat at the beginning of Wednesday's episodes that that episode wasn't

110
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
I don't think you've gotten

111
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Bad

112
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
So don't expect

113
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
Like we throwing around anything

114
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
I don't know what is exact

115
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Something's Atwood

116
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Be traumatic

117
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
For someone to hear

118
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
But I don't think he gets into any of that Terror

119
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
We're safe

120
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
In terms of disgust piss is almost going to make the hammer drop even more horrific

121
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
We find this episode makes it so much more.

122
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,031
Depressing where it ends up

123
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
So

124
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Anyway

125
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,919
Eva's first clip where Alex is starting off

126
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,503
The show I found out that it is Adam Lanza

127
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Who was the

128
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Perpetrator of the shooting

129
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Is viceland a lot of information

130
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Reporting on it

131
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
He thinks is the most important

132
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,239
Me away on this

133
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
I like that I like that you said that as if

134
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
Do you have time traveled and listen to our episode

135
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
He didn't show up and stay open

136
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Sunday

137
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,063
Wild horses

138
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
I almost hurt him played and if you think of that

139
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,279
Didn't speak much for my mental state broadcast

140
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,959
We are going to be here for 2 hours obviously

141
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,463
I want to drill into

142
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Viciously right now and

143
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,151
Ecology

144
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Throughout history

145
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
Disarm the people

146
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
So this is what he's more interested

147
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
I think the supposedly the means

148
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Tim

149
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
I don't know

150
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
I think it's still on the cusp

151
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,143
Of being inappropriate monstrous

152
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
Got a question we're going to have to keep coming back to is like

153
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Is this monstrous threat

154
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
And I think

155
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Because of the initial

156
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Speculative

157
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
I think to a certain extent a day a day and a half

158
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
2 Days Later

159
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
You could still have like we might get more information on this

160
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
And it might end up 5

161
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
This is wrong also

162
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Reporting

163
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Developing story

164
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Not a

165
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Recover operating

166
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:20,287
It's not says William Hopper leading a climate change

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,711
I know you're not happy about that

168
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
Believe so

169
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Yeah

170
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
I think that bodes well for

171
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,463
Climate

172
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
So

173
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
Like I said I think that's

174
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
I don't like the idea of

175
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
He wants to spend

176
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Most of the rest

177
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,263
Show talking about the psychology of gun

178
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
It might it might be the wrong thing to focus on declared a national emergency

179
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Laws passed

180

Schoolboy

181
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
In this next clip though

182
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
You hear Alex

183
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
It is very comforting

184
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
The beginning of the clip

185
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
And then wander into very on

186
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
But it starts pretty well

187
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
4

188
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
But

189
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,647
Okay

190
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719

00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
120

196
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
So I don't like that characterization of

197
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
People

198
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
That clip is to me

199
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Leave the path of Alex

200
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Because it starts with

201
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
If you believe the official story and I-10

202
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,095
Which is good which doesn't sound accurate though

203
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
That is not a good

204
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Reporting

205
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Q indicating that I think

206
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
It might be real

207
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
But then when he starts giving his reason for why

208
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
It might be real

209
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
He's like

210
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Because of vaccines turning a door frame

211
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
The beginning point

212
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Right there close to acceptable to end a thought I believe

213
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,911
I think I believe you.

214
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
New thought

215
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Yep

216
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
And Derek that sort of mentality

217
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Carries On In

218
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
Text clip

219
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
From a defensible place in

220
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Into a real.

221
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Not vents

222
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
Because

223
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
Has children and most of us have young children

224
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
And when

225
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:19,903
Incredible

226
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,287
And the reason the reason that it's gone up is because of all these

227
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
These people on these sites

228
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
Like to see

229
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
Offer condolences

230
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Most of the families

231
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Right

232
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
Because that doesn't Decay that he does know that

233
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
He knows

234
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Tito's

235
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
Everybody everybody

236
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,071
He wouldn't behave this way if there wasn't an awareness on some levels at like

237
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
Whatever I end up saying eventually

238
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
I don't know if you

239
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
How much awareness he has it

240
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
No matter which end of this road is the beginning of the road is awareness

241
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
But this is real

242
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Yeah

243
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
That's good

244
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
But also way worse eight mix yeah it makes the eventual Infowars harassment

245
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
These people

246
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
So much more

247
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,511
Dirty

248
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
Intentional in and disgusting

249
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Holy s*** these mass shootings

250
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Tireli possible

251
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
They are

252
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Increasing

253
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
And my children

254
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919
If that's fine

255
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Fart

256
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
You get there

257
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,951
I mean it's not it's it's kind of it's a little bit like that

258
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Right

259
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
I agree with you

260
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Dealing with Alex Jones

261
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
Yeah

262
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
But again it's a huge loss

263
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Indicate

264
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Things later

265
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
It's built on a foundation

266
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Absolutely

267
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Right

268
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Do we know exactly

269
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
This is that is entirely a years later

270
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
This is not excuse

271
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,711
No by any means but it is a sort of recency bias there with him right

272
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,063
Kevin later on cuz he doesn't give a f*** anymore

273
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Because

274
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
Like all of us has become

275
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Possibly you know it could be

276
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Preemptive just

277
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,119
Certification for his only wanting to talk about guns

278
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,959
Rightly because that makes him talking about guns and how they want to grab them

279
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,055
And all that stuff a little more palatable because he's at the same time recognizing

280
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
The horrible tragedy

281
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
So there's

282
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
There again

283
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
We're speculating

284
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623
Possible to know exactly

285
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
What is going through his mind

286
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
These are

287
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
These are some of the things you kind of

288
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,815
Might be going through his mind when you deal with someone like that

289
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Inveterate liar

290
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,703
It's like a small

291
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,031
Broken ring in the chin

292
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
This guy is a psychopath but for one brief second you can see that missing scale in the underbelly of them

293
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
We know that he doesn't

294
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
You say it's fake it before that clip

295
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
But we have 2:15

296
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
I don't believe

297
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
Based on our last episode

298
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,423
All these nefarious weirdos

299
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
And convinced him

300
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
Right

301
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
That kind of

302
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
It loses a little bit of it

303
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
But I still don't know what the path is

304
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,527
There's a real

305
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
That he needed those sorts of people to

306
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
The cover

307
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Intrinsically wanted to me

308
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Maybe because they're better for traffic to the website

309
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Maybe because they're better

310
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,167
Reinforces they want your guns narrative

311
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Impossible but

312
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
I'm excited to see

313
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
I bet it's not as soon as we think

314
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
You know

315
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
We listen to the December

316
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,391
21st 2012 episode 41 of our

317
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Episode

318
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,583
That's true all that much

319
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
From what I recall

320
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Christmas

321
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
After that

322
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
He's got to take

323
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Couple days off Broadway

324
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
Christmas

325
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
The end of the year I bet he doesn't

326
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
That's my prediction for right now

327
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
I really don't like him bringing up Sirhan Sirhan like

328
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
Robert Kennedy wouldn't be his greatest

329
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,695
Mortal enemy there's ever been because do a lot of that repurposing villains in it

330
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Allies

331
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
History

332
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Them however he sees fit the greatest

333
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
And murdering the eventual

334
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
True president

335
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
Example of that

336
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
Super egregious that we'll be on our next episode

337
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
We'll get to that when we get to it

338
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
Wants to make the argument

339
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
Course

340
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
He's going to

341
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Use resources

342
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
Is that I think might be a little biased

343
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
There's overtime

344
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
Cetera

345
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Your gun

346
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
In order to do it that was the first

347
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
Serdica knives

348
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,575
In Australia and New Zealand

349
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Brazil

350
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
The preservation of

351
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Have you

352
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,031
School shootings are mall shooting

353
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,295
We didn't have semi-auto handguns and rifles

354
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
Register

355
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
And then

356
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,840
Where somebody uses a bolt-action

357
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
That's not how it works

358
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Country

359
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Different histories

360
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Gun laws

361
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
And they all have come

362
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Two different places

363
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah if a gun law perspective

364
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Advair

365
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
National sovereignty has led them to

366
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
1st Amendment

367
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Japan

368
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,368
First Amendment rights are there variable gun laws

369
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
I'm just a country

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Over simple

371
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
Application

372
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,656
These attacks

373
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
But the reason he's doing that is because

374
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
That is what you'd like

375
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,408
The store you'd like to tell

376
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Throughout the course of history

377
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Xscape theater

378
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
Attacks in order to the road gun rights

379
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Gun laws

380
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,880
And he believes that Obama is an aspiring authoritarian Hitler

381
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
Then

382
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,256
Follows from those two premises at the conclusion is that Sandy Hook is fake

383
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Yeah

384
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,192
Of course orchestrated by government whether it is real or not it has to

385
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,520
To be orchestrated right in order for the government to take our guns

386
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
Either it's bacon

387
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
Or it's making everybody it doesn't matter either way

388
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Anywhere near actor

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
I will say that with

390
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
I don't

391
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
Very close

392
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Like what he wants to say is

393
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,376
Quickly they marched like him

394
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Who shot up everybody

395
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
He was all drugged up they killed him in the school

396
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
And then covered it up

397
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
What's up like that

398
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
That's the version of it that seems like what he wants to tell

399
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
The actor stuff

400
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Because even on his

401
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
Yeah 100%

402
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
This is absolutely him saying that

403
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
The government murdered

404
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
People

405
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Statesville whole thing like the mood lamp

406
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
Ending which we all of course no

407
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Right it is

408
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
I think it's

409
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
To save it

410
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't know I don't know what's worse

411
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
Because

412
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Children if you call them crisis actors and it is

413
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
This one might be

414
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,344
On the slightly different

415
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
Basically

416
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Take it to its parts

417
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,840
What are you implying

418
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,192
People cuz it's not just the government actually

419
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,288
Did the killing of those children

420
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:17,408
You're imagining some member of course

421
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
Pretty awful to put on somebody

422
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
The other version

423
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Pretending

424
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
Both of them

425
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
I don't know where to plant my flag

426
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Worse

427
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,536
Yeah but they're but they're both

428
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Tremendously and

429
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
Incredibly disrespectful

430
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Just absolutely psychopath

431
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
The only reason I bring that up at all is

432
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Because the tickets in Portage

433
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Recognize

434
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Is there are different breeds

435
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
And I think Alex

436
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Traffic

437
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Yeah

438
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,272
I don't think that version

439
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,160
Synthetic staged

440
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
Some of that could have actually been the influence

441
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Negative

442
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,120
But he was ready to hear it based on him believing

443
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
Did it and I'd setup Adam Lamb so I don't know

444
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640
Look at you think that 911 is an inside job that's awful

445
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,272
If you think that 911 didn't actually happen in the towers are still there

446
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
It's weird

447
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
I think

448
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Me the most about this investigation at

449
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
The unknown

450
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Miss of it

451
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Great expanse

452
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
We're walking in

453
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
KOA campsite this is the actual would know

454
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
Is that

455
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
That nuance

456
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Difference

457
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
He actually saying

458
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
Lizzy Capri understand that better

459
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Do you understand

460
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
The present better

461
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
Yes there is something

462
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
From that even if it does seem like

463
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
A little bit

464
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,952
That's a moral argument that

465
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
It doesn't make any sense

466
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,328
At the end of the day there's there's children

467
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
The conclusion that

468
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
He's tough

469
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
His world

470
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,080
I still don't think that lets him off the hook for any

471
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,920
Curiosity

472
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
What's an excuse

473
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Still word investigation

474
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,672
Is worse than we thought which was Bill worst still hasn't shown

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
I don't know

476
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Take the guns they're all doing

477
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,704
Like all this stuff whether or not

478
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
They want

479
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
How to take gun

480
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Because

481
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Pittsburgh gone on

482
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
They want to take guns

483
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Treaty says

484
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
Animation for fiction Summit

485
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:38,112
Church Road

486
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Because civilian ownership a firearm

487
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
That's problem

488
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
Is that a quote from

489
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Potential source

490
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
It's hard to tell exactly

491
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Where that entered

492
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
Call phone if you

493
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
He's going on about here is the arms trade treaty

494
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
2014

495
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
Since the process began

496
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Sign

497
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
It's been focused

498
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Ton of patriot propaganda

499
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,328
Specifically that it was the world government signaling thereabouts

500
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Everyone gun

501
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
The problem is that it doesn't do anything

502
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,800
The arms trade treaty as the name might suggest what about International illegal weapons trap

503
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
That's very clearly and specifically what it was

504
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,456
Creating International agreements to put in place instruments to help

505
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
Blackmarketarms

506
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Begin to release you should be

507
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
Does it kind of gives legal law-abiding gun owners a bad rap

508
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Buttercup

509
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,864
People but it also hurts

510
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,984
It was almost called the no-more Iran-Contra

511
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
He also knows a lot of those dude

512
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
That could be an issue

513
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,432
It was doing

514
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
You says if they're loyal opposition

515
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Like 2012

516
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,160
He is not super into the NRA

517
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Do you like

518
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,840
Right roads

519
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
From your keyboard

520
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
It's a very boring energy

521
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
He has a

522
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,920
They don't actually talk about at all

523
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
The Treaty of self is UN arms trade

524
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
I go so far out of its way to stress

525
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,416
The individual states are not bound by the treaties alter any of their domestic laws

526
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
From page one

527
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
Words specifically reaffirm quote

528
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
The Sovereign right of any state to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory

529
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
The only goal in constitutional system

530
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
The treaty even gives countries a backdoor to leave

531
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
I want to be a part of as it says an article 24

532
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,552
Each state party Shaolin exercising its National sovereignty have the right to withdraw from this

533
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
They even say that they don't

534
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
Have to give a reason to withdraw

535
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,768
And the only qualification is that if a country with drawers

536
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
That doesn't mean that they're immune

537
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,936
Consequences for breaking the treaty but only if they broke the treaty before they withdrew

538
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
Most toothless thing that you could have more or less

539
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Withdraw from the show you

540
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:45,504
You've been breaking it and get away with it

541
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
The only thing I can think of that Alex

542
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
We talkin about here

543
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Other thing

544
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,720
Is the UN report that they released in July

545
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
2001

546
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
It was held about

547
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
Erratic small arms and light weapons

548
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Not surprisingly

549
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,960
It's also didn't say anything about it

550
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Rights to own

551
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
We reaffirm quote

552
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,176
The right of self-determination of all people

553
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
Taking into account the particular situation

554
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,832
The people's under Colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation

555
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,160
And recognizing the right of people to take legitimate action

556
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
With the charter of the United Nations

557
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
To realize their inalienable right of self-determination

558
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:36,192
This shall not be construed as authorizing any action that would dismember or impair

559
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
Integrity or political

560
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
Independence Day

561
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
Conducted themselves

562
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,408
In compliance with the principle of equal rights and self-determination of all

563
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Wait

564
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:52,064
If I understand correctly does that mean that if

565
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:57,952
You are like the Virgin Islands and you decide that you want to be your own country

566
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
Illegal weapon sales are fine

567
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,400
No cuz this is this is that report not the treaty itself

568
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
Very reasonably could be

569
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,640
Take up arms

570
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,528
American Revolution total selling illegal weapons till like Russia

571
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
We got to solve this probably recognized

572
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
Of people's to take legitimate action

573
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Realize their inalienable right of self-determination

574
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
I mean they're straight-up sing the right of occupied in Colonial Heights

575
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
To take up arms against their oppressors

576
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Witches

577
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,872
But I guess if you can

578
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Came to a point where

579
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,760
You could demonstrate or had a good argument that the United Nation in and of itself

580
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,368
Was making it so you had no self-determination or freedom

581
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Jacob armpit

582
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Where is similar to

583
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,104
France recognizing the United States is the country immediately following the Declaration of Independence

584
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
You know like the UN will immediately

585
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,480
Cheap knives if you're a colonized

586
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
If you're like hate I don't I don't know if

587
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
Positive that hasn't been used well or anything like that

588
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,680
Put out in July 2001

589
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
That report eventual arms trade treaty

590
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Does discuss the need

591
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Regulation and oversight of weapons

592
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Exporters

593
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
You be able to find

594
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Legal weapons traffic

595
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
So I bet anything that this is what Alex's

596
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Exaggerating

597
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
He was any attempt

598
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
To deal with the problems created by the illegal use of gun

599
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
And being an attack on his legal ownership

600
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
I'm at the position that requires

601
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Create strawman out of every perceived

602
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Attack on Gunn

603
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
Which unfortunately undermines whatever he wants his boy

604
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,568
And I also the US signs at but it's never been ratified so we're not really even subject

605
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,408
Ratification would have required two-thirds vote in the Senate

606
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
He was dying to 2013

607
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Even though the Democratic

608
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,904
E345 lead over the Republicans that session of Congress McConnell was still the minority leader there's no chance

609
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
Alabama was going to be able to sway enough Republicans ratified

610
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
God dammit McConnell is going to go down as one of his

611
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
History's great villains

612
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,216
He has carved out a real spot for himself has real bad

613
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
Civilian ownership of any firearm in the United

614
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,176
The legitimate power Monopoly of the state is not a quote

615
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
You want it all

616
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,064
Put out by the NRA and the Heritage Foundation

617
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
In order to undermine support for the treaty

618
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,464
None of Alex's information reflects reality nor does it come from

619
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
Yeah and even that power Monopoly of the state touch libertarian language

620
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,264
No way a Blog

621
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
Would phrase it that way

622
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,920
So in this next clip Alex listen to a bunch 2009

623
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
Because we know a lot of those narratives

624
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Is using in 2009

625
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
He's using them still

626
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
2012

627
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
About them as if they're

628
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
As opposed to being things we

629
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
About

630
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
That were dated 2009

631
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
Weird

632
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Weird to have Mamas & the Papas behind that

633
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Yeah very weird

634
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
Anna Mello

635
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
Throw the brake button eating gun for

636
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
The Prozac heads

637
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
He is gross not good

638
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
My exit is just my except all the stuff from 2009

639
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Perceive

640
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,696
The tax on the Patriot community in the

641
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Militias and stuff like that

642
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
You put it under a microscope

643
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
You look at it and

644
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
You see that he's just making that up

645
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
And it's this is why

646
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Things

647
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
We do or importance

648
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
Because now that we have that is a piece of our awareness

649
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
And people understand

650
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
You can hear that clip

651
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
And before

652
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
You could have thought

653
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
Security at all these people trying to demonize the Patriots

654
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
I don't know

655
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,696
We do know real events

656
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:22,304
Years later absolutely pulling from these Wells of his brain

657
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
In order to justify the gun grabber

658
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,680
Paranoia narrative in order to

659
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
I don't know what would you call it

660
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
Create

661
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
Like foliage around having

662
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Talk about Sandy Hook

663
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Specifically

664
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Like in

665
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
The like

666
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Wishy-washy

667
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Teasing saying

668
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
And stuff like that

669
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
It was the day off

670
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
No matter what

671
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,840
So I can buy even more time

672
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,448
B just talk about whatever

673
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Talk about

674
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Reality of Adam

675
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,664
Missing the forest for the trees

676
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Yes yeah

677
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Yeah intentionally

678
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
Absolutely

679
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
That was not a

680
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,208
Goodnight at the end of the clip you heard him say

681
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
The video game head

682
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
Sure

683
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
What is it

684
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
I don't know if we I don't know if I know that I was wondering if I can some reporting somewhere

685
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Episode

686
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,480
I don't know how 13 Lightning Returns having is better than

687
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
13

688
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,392
Choose were overpowered but listen

689
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
We're having a great time

690
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,584
If he said that he like Eternal Darkness I have to head back to you

691
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
In the woods

692
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
But it's interesting because

693
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
I have heard a lot of

694
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,776
From time to time

695
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,848
Alex just trust video game

696
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
Actually we have a listener who is a

697
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
He has a

698
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
The globalist

699
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
Michael

700
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
Who message

701
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Me about 1

702
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
To hear about Alex's take on

703
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
Right

704
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
A full episode

705
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
It comes

706
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,608
You're not really fully able to satisfy that

707
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
I think in the Sandy Hook

708
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
We're going to accidentally

709
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
He's using to

710
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
In the same way that

711
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
He's using he's a Prozac head

712
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:56,416
I want to say that he's more like the bar video games I like

713
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Hunter guide

714
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:03,072
Super golf or whatever it's called like that thing sexy photo hunt

715
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
Talk more about the video game

716
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
And how they make

717
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
People crazy

718
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,800
They like

719
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
It's always just some weird

720
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,880
All movies

721
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
He is expressing basically like

722
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
Updated version of the

723
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
Lights 100%

724
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Tired

725
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
Tired arguing

726
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,944
What is usually used by people who wished

727
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
To restrict

728
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Free speech

729
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,832
You know people like a Tipper Gore

730
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,928
Who want these

731
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
This sort of argument is not something

732
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
Ever expect to hear out of someone

733
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,888
Thinks they're a libertarian

734
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
Video game guy kill a guy

735
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,288
What the f***

736
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,407
Regular or do you outlaw video games as a v

737
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
Mario jump

738
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
That's right that's right

739
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:16,447
Killing the guy like

740
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Straight up

741
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,823
So much Hyrule Warriors

742
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
But

743
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,991
They're always called Kaos they're listed as knockouts

744
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
I mean

745
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Gray

746
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
Take that sort of mentality

747
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
It really does

748
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Become like

749
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Neurosurgeon

750
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Slippery slope

751
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Spotlight

752
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,167
It does become a situation where you're like wow

753
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
What is it that you're actually

754
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
What's the devil

755
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Poltergeist

756
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Well yes

757
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,711
Anything with Gabriel Byrne in it movie

758
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
In 2012

759
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:06,111
They're always watching Poltergeist battery saver

760
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Better yet

761
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
Kids love Robert

762
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
The other

763
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,863
The other other

764
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
Let the idea that means not literally talk about

765
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
About the devil like the

766
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
What is the

767
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
The point where

768
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Your

769
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,175
Like this is no good is that a spy

770
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
Censorious position to have

771
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
And it is not

772
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Think you expect

773
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
I'm someone who is it

774
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
Is libertarian

775
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Or whatever

776
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,279
It's not like that alone should be an invalidation of Alex

777
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
Pretending he has the principles absolutely

778
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
This you wind up getting

779
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
The

780
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,823
AR

781
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
So if you have

782
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
Imperative

783
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
Then it's PG-13 you can save

784
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
What is that

785
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
What does that even mean

786
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Armstrong

787
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
Body that does

788
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Terrible

789
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:21,375
If your parents know what you're going to

790
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:26,495
You need a shorthand for parent I heard the How to Train Your Dragon

791
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
So I'm pretty excited about that

792
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,103
It's called how to train your Deadpool 3

793
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
That's

794
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
I saw the second

795
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Yeah

796
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
I had a lot of thoughts

797
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,375
Especially considering his name is toothless

798
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,751
How to say the Dragon for another day but

799
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
Whatever

800
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
I was on the gas man

801
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,247
I might not have thought about that bro

802
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Yamato

803
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,855
Alex says

804
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
What I would describe as

805
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
The most ironic

806
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,487
Given what we know about the

807
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
The future

808
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,327
Yeah but like rain on your wedding day but it sounds

809
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Good

810
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
2 days after the shooting

811
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Good

812
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
But we know too much

813
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,079
So put your mic down.

814
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Piece of

815
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Oops

816
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,623
The Second Amendment

817
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
So

818
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,287
I think at the ironies delicious there the idea that he's

819
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,871
Condemning these reporters trying to harass the families

820
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
We know that the end result of so many of his actions

821
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,319
And I'm not I'm not saying

822
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
People who has

823
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
Yeah

824
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Gone to court

825
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,815
Part of their probation has been

826
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Listen to Infowars

827
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
It's not some sort of

828
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,543
Wacky idea that we have that a lot of his listeners have this impulse

829
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Harassed

830
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
But

831
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
Dragonborn out by reality

832
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
I think to have but I don't think

833
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
It reflects reality

834
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
I don't think the reporters were harassing the families trying to get them to say bad things about

835
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
They shouldn't take can I agree with Alex

836
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,239
D I use humor to deal with these types of thing

837
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
Like fat

838
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,151
Truly is in retrospect

839
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
Is utterly reprehensible

840
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Not reprehensible

841
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,743
Reflecting

842
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,583
Or inability to understand what

843
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
In front of him

844
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Like the idea that he thinks

845
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
These families are

846
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Being harassed by

847
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:43,103
Journalist work some more actors

848
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
We're acting out trying to get the story

849
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,783
Trying to get to do whatever but like

850
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
His inability to

851
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Exactly what's going on Isley

852
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Biatch

853
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
Sort of Pop immorality

854
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
But it's hilarious

855
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
Because we know

856
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
Yeah and it's not the number one purveyor of making them harassed

857
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,007
And that's not laughing at the tragedy that's laugh

858
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Alex

859
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,871
I guess what you're laughing at is that he knows

860
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Better

861
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
You know that heat likes in the same way that clip earlier the replayed where he's giving condolences to the family

862
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,343
Monsters that you know something really bad

863
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,903
Do you know other people

864
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
People's actions

865
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Call

866
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Negative reactions for the victim

867
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,399
She is kind of like a

868
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
No this is intentionally

869
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Because he

870
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
He himself said that it was intentionally awful to

871
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
Do the thing that happen

872
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,991
I think you would have is like I had no idea that my action

873
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
Would cause this thing that I know is Tara

874
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,599
You should be

875
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,159
Eagle

876
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,767
If you don't know if you don't realize that what

877
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
You're saying

878
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Will leave

879
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,911
People to harass these people

880
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
You don't realize that

881
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
You're playing with fire there yet

882
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,823
Have any Master irresponsible actor that

883
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Should

884
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
Just not be allowed

885
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,943
You just shouldn't be alive Sports

886
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,503
America

887
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,111
Miller on Monday Night Football

888
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,951
Hey we already know what he thinks about Kaepernick so we definitely do with him covering

889
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
I know that was the wrong thing

890
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Weather

891
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
I was trying to pick her up

892
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,799
Tomorrow because I was trying to figure out the slot

893
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
To put that we still lost

894
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:55,455
And my mind wouldn't allow me to go to celebrity gossip

895
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:01,855
Cuz he would even Peter teal would have to sue them at some point

896
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Yeah

897
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
Alex Jones

898
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
There's no way

899
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Instead of this

900
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Credible

We're all excited

Send it to a lifetime of

00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
The worst

910
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Human interest stories

911
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:53,823
Just inconsequential Americans conspiracy is home videos

912
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
The secret service has

913
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
To follow him on

914
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,199
Newton like

915
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,551
Go to prison

916
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Kind of hell

917
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Or like

918
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255

Relationship

922

Or something like that

923
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Wow

924
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
To actually read

925
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
And discuss

926
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
The primary sources that detox

927
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,431
Oh yeah okay

928
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Punishment

929
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,295
Describe but it might be the only it might be a therapy

930
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,135
Make him a paralegal for the splc

931
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
I don't think that would do it

932
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
I think just assume every

933
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,631
No matter how

934
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399

Workshop

936
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,495
You need to have someone discussing with him

937
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
And confront him with it in a setting that

938
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
We can't leave

939
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,175
Court order

940
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
It's fun to think about what

941
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551
Would be a good punishment

942
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:13,695
Every morning he wakes up and has to live out that dream of going.

943
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
That's what happened

944
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:21,887
Back in high school on super cool never wanted to f****** goes to high school and is out.

End of America

952
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
The beginning

953
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Wrongly

954
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
Very much I can already tell you wrong

955
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Yeah

956
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,967
Rough and Tumble

957
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
It's true

958
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
When he says hey lady

959
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,607
Illegal firearms

960
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Ulcer Soul Factory

961
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
Because I'm say I don't want it to be

962
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Siri born that way

963
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
Gear the Kim

964
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Defining

965
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
1770

966
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
No

967
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
It's just a

968
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Everything's good

969
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Yeah

970
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Yep

971
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
America was

972
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
That's

973
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
This very argument

974
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
Has been going on since

975
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
The beginning

976
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Gmail

977
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
Like

978
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Institutional Congress

979
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
There were these gun folks

980
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,967
In those congress's there were so many of them

981
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
Socialized medicine and then other people will like

982
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,207
What if we killed everybody like it was it was that

983
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
You know like you have so many people like

984
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:30,911
Centralized Power Within

985
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Going through all this s***

986
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
F****** argument

987
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,335
The goddamn beginning

988
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,383
This country is a f****** mess

989
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
With differ

990
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
Different presentation

991
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,551
I don't know I would say if

992
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
The people

993
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
Who it wasn't

994
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,695
The majority of people in the colonies

995
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,767
Who wanted to start this Revolutionary War

996
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
No

997
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
Fine

998
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,679
I got a little bit of higher taxes

999
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727
Start a revolution that's

1000
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Uber travels

1001
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
I would say

1002
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
History is boring out there

1003
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,479
Really

1004
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
Well the only reason I resist any of that

1005
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Cm

1006
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
Because like if we were still

1007
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
Like the United States as it is now but

1008
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,743
The United Kingdom right I don't think I'll be better

1009
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,143
We can just have the queen on her money and everybody be fine

1010
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
I think

1011
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Quite frankly

1012
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
If

1013
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Like Alex's

1014
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Describing the thing

1015
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
The Revolutionary War

1016
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
Gun

1017
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
People having

1018
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
But it wouldn't be the second

1019
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
It would be an immense

1020
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,087
It would be the first

1021
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,535
A baby the structure of government as laid out in the Articles and stuff

1022
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,655
Hey the reason

1023
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,447
Thought thought

1024
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,287
These things that are added in

1025
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
You back

1026
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
Inalienable human right

1027
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Cut-out design

1028
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,343
Hm yelling about how Obama

1029
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
Cheated

1030
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,999
Sure about that

1031
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:37,119
Was a scam as well

1032
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
That's a music started

1033
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,711
Too early I think you miss time that break a little bit

1034
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
Little bit

1035
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,831
A little much

1036
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
Also things

1037
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Was fake

1038
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,143
You know like all of it the corporate media

1039
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Oh that's

1040
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,567
What is the action you're implying

1041
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Exactly

1042
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Faking

1043
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Agreed

1044
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
Absolutely if you're saying that

1045
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,783
Get the old mainstream media

1046
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Is Mannie face is not

1047
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Is is

1048
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:07,231
Because they know even liberals who

1049
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,303
Still believe in the mainstream media are buying guns

1050
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
Create this situation

1051
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Mission in order to

1052
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,263
Exactly

1053
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Every part of this is like

1054
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,199
It is very much a where there's smoke

1055
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
There's a fake Sandy Hook

1056
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,367
Yeah

1057
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,207
Yeah

1058
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Pinterest

1059
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
From this Friday to Sunday

1060
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Jump

1061
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
Is that the cheese

1062
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
I don't think Alex was even in

1063
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
Control of it necessarily

1064
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
I would say just

1065
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:58,175
But maybe what he's doing is there yeah on on Friday and now on Sunday I think we're on much solid or ground

1066
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
There's a tease

1067
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
I'm going to understand that I don't trust what's going on

1068
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
Right right

1069
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,791
Here is how he finds

1070
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Yeah

1071
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,351
He is doing something

1072
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
I would say

1073
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Could be considered calculator

1074
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
In that

1075
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,383
He's not kind of all over the map in this episode

1076
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Specifically pointing out

1077
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,967
It's almost like he's building a case

1078
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
Psyche specifically

1079
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,831
Finding out the motivations of different groups like the UN

1080
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
The mainstream media

1081
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:45,023
One of them is conclusion then

1082
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
To all of

1083
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,375
And how much

1084
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
He's just a result of

1085
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
He's had to split with

1086
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
This for a couple days

1087
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
Chinese War Ready

1088
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
In the middle of the show

1089
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
On Friday

1090
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,599
First off those are some dope Beats

1091
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,927
About people taking your gun

1092
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,999
Obviously people having a conversation

1093
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Aftermath

1094
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
We'll figure out where to go from

1095
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
That much

1096
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
Embassy in other places

1097
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
With the Prozac heads.

1098
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,567
Has a built-in narrative

1099
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
About people

1100
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,127
Taking psych medication

1101
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
Making them kill him

1102
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,967
Write off like that

1103
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:42,367
He has been my Accra for its third row that they're doing it on

1104
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
Everybody

1105
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,439
Well that DHS report was that other one

1106
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:49,023
We talked about

1107
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Yeah Mike is a much better

1108
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Interesting

1109
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Because

1110
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,823
You know the

1111
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,383
Implicit vaccine narrative do you throwing out there

1112
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Psych meds narrative

1113
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
There's a

1114
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
I'm grabbing narrative

1115
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
And so you have all of the

1116
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
But

1117
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
He adds

1118
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
Because it's a school shooting

1119
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
And stuff like that

1120
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
The video game

1121
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Right

1122
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Get back to it

1123
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,727
Collectivist

1124
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Prozac

1125
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,847
Ridgeland had

1126
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,319
So

1127
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:48,671
I mean that I'm more fine with

1128
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,487
Video games

1129
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
Pretty much

1130
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,911
At least they aren't absolutes for him

1131
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,959
I'm a libertarian

1132
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,239
Some wiggle room

1133
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
There's a virgin that I think should be prohibited

1134
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,407
Where is everybody

1135
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,295
Adult

1136
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
It's hard with video

1137
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,351
Eurasian has that subculture that you just can't understand

1138
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,911
A part of it or around a lot

1139
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
Alex

1140
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Yes

1141
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
Video games

1142
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
Because

1143
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
Right

1144
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,919
Not frequent

1145
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
But it is

1146
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
2 Days Later

1147
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
Wasn't talking much about video games

1148
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
Friday

1149
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
Now that he's in the age subset

1150
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
He would associate

1151
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
With it

1152
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
Part of

1153
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
His brain

1154
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Video game

1155
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
It's huge

1156
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
Yeah

1157
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,727
In this next clip

1158
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
I don't even

1159
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
The Pond Guy

1160
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:13,407
Years older than me

1161
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,575
I don't know my timeline so f***** up

1162
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
Hi Betty play Gold

1163
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
Yeah but

1164
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,095
First person shooter games

1165
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
So at the end

1166
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
No good favorite movies are John

1167
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,103
Doodlebops games are problem

1168
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
Hot water right here

1169
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
Fire John Wayne

1170
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
Isn't the coolest ever

1171
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Oh no

1172
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:26,111
So what are you talkin about shoot-'em-up games

1173
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
Created by the Department of Defense

1174
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Now this.

1175
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
Interesting

1176
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
Alex is kind of right

1177
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,279
But he's also kind of wrong

1178
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,983
What he's right about is that DOD funding was involved with some of the earliest video game

1179
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,775
Like back in the 1950s

1180
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
A man named William Higginbotham

1181
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
Who worked at Brooke great man

1182
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
On some of the early

1183
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,807
Computers that they have visitors

1184
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Yeah early version

1185
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,975
Right by the government

1186
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
Create

1187
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
But in 1993 the Marines noticed

1188
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
The rising popularity

1189
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,423
And they wanted to see if there were ways to

1190
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
New technology

1191
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
Help supplement

1192
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,031
Particularly because

1193
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
It would be waived

1194
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
Cheaper than what they

1195
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
They were working

1196
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,343
Great effects

1197
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
3D environment

1198
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Like boxes

1199
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
Then just developing a software or whatever that is

1200
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
A simulation

1201
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,703
Adjustment

1202
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
Make it work

1203
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
But the finished product was never official

1204
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,847
It was called Wolfenstein

1205
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,663
Who's called

1206
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,479
Which is not a great name

1207
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
Could not be less creative than

1208
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Marine blank

1209
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,927
It's not the games themselves that have application

1210
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
A training

1211
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,279
And don't explain the reasons

1212
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
It's the technology that is

1213
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,631
Is used to make them

1214
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,727
It was the innovation of navigating

1215
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
The environment

1216
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
Which shooting games it's the

1217
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
Team

1218
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,663
Recreate Anthony for immediate decision making

1219
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
It's built into the structure of the game

1220
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,039
So those sorts of things are very big innovation

1221
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
In

1222
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Technology

1223
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Simulator

1224
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
Computing simulation

1225
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
But not

1226
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,999
The games themselves are treating you

1227
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Right

1228
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
That's important

1229
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:48,703
Distinction if we have soldiers who are doing the stuff in real life what if we also had them play Counter-Strike

1230
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Did that

1231
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,055
Well and learn how to look around corners

1232
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
That's

1233
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
It's not what they do

1234
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
If they have the

1235
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Has been

1236
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,855
Developed by the development of the

1237
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
These games

1238
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
Video game

1239
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Company

1240
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
Right

1241
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,583
Jahmani on government contracts and stuff like that

1242
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,631
What is it game development

1243
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,703
The breakthroughs that they make

1244
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,495
The training

1245
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
Things that the Gulf

1246
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
In the military

1247
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
Hanyu

1248
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Those Technologies

1249
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
Right is that make sense

1250
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,807
Yes like a like One Pilots are in those giant

1251
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
Yeah this is such an important

1252
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,671
What drives the game

1253
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
And what like

1254
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,487
Is behind it

1255
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,791
He's not what they're interested in

1256
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,583
They're not interested

1257
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
Open world

1258
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:53,471
Open world

1259
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
They don't want

1260
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Train p

1261
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Lookout

1262
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,823
4

1263
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Enemies

1264
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,663
Whatever by playing breath of the Wild

1265
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,199
They're interested

1266
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
The breakthroughs in

1267
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
Technology that they can

1268
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,295
Reply to their own

1269
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
Like

1270
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:13,951
Like drones and s*** like that like the movie toys not I don't know why I'm doing

1271
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
Movie Rec

1272
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,327
Something like that

1273
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Able to

1274
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:28,031
With the simulations that they use for training

1275
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,567
Inside the army

1276
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Okay don't make

1277
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Play Call of Duty 2

1278
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
Trained right all right

1279
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Technology

1280
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
That are part of the

1281
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,063
Creation of those game

1282
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,183
In order to use in their own way and order to amplify their own

1283
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,279
As technology has gotten so much better

1284
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
Video game

1285
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
The

1286
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
Controls of them has

1287
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,887
Developed over

1288
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,167
You are essential

1289
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
Able to

1290
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
Creates

1291
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,751
It is very similar to

1292
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
The plane that you don't have to fly a plane

1293
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,383
Right

1294
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Principal Financial

1295
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
I even Learn to Fly plane

1296
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Menards

1297
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,831
And that's why everybody in the Marines

1298
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:18,719
Thinks that ebony is an ore and a metal because they play Skyrim all the goddamn time

1299
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
The point is that is new

1300
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
An important distinction

1301
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
About like

1302
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
The difference between

1303
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
Pentagon

1304
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Video game

1305
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
As opposed to

1306
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
How Alex

1307
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Presenting

1308
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
He's presenting it as

1309
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
They paid all this money

1310
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
In order

1311
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,223
These games to get created

1312
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
Every shoot-'em-up in them at all

1313
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Tile

1314
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
F****** stupid

1315
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,719
Would you look at where the money

1316
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
Be interested in

1317
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Sing

1318
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Because I think it's

1319
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Evil

1320
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
I also think

1321
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Hope the terms of

1322
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
If you're going to train people anyway doing it that way

1323
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
Paying for

1324
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,711
So many video games I've gotten

1325
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
Of technology that there was underlying funding

1326
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
From the government in order to create

1327
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,439
The internet etcetera

1328
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
I don't know it

1329
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
More complicated

1330
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,351
The Last Starfighter

1331
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
This is not how it work

1332
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:36,031
There's no intrinsic training that you get for playing first-person shooters

1333
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
In terms of decision bake

1334
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,383
All of those snap decisions

1335
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Stuff like that that are created by

1336
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
Like a purse purse

1337
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
Person shooter

1338
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,319
Exact same thing is like you got a flip that blocks

1339
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,111
Yeah part of your brain

1340
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
You don't experience a descent

1341
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
Sedation about death video game

1342
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,023
Unless you're probably already on that passed

1343
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,791
To begin with

1344
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
For any number of Papa

1345
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,887
Facts about the

1346
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Video game

1347
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
It's about the purse

1348
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Experience

1349
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,263
Right and if you are a libertarian

1350
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,055
That should be a big consideration

1351
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:13,919
And for you never once considered killing

1352
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,759
The more important aspect of the military in

1353
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,367
Video games

1354
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
Benazepril

1355
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,183
And that's our largest intro

1356
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
These days

1357
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,535
Games like Call of Duty all those games

1358
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
Are essentially

1359
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Propaganda

1360
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
To a certain extent

1361
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,567
We're coming out we're like Army propaganda

1362
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Pennywise

1363
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
Another thing about 7

1364
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
Consider is that the investment that the military

1365
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
The development of

1366
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
Technology

1367
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
A well

1368
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,551
Princeton

1369
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,575
Stimulation

1370
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
Therapeutic environment

1371
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,415
To help returning soldiers

1372
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Ttsd

1373
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,511
It's obviously not a perfect treatment

1374
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
But it showed a lot of promise

1375
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
Helping soldiers deal with traumatic

1376
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
Negative

1377
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,959
So there is that a payoff

1378
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
It comes from the investor

1379
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,079
So all this is to say that

1380
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
Stupid

1381
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,639
Is dealing with it

1382
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Dimension

1383
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Supposed

1384
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
Thinking about like

1385
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
What were they doing

1386
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
Why

1387
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
It is

1388
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
There's a lot of video game history has

1389
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
The government

1390
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Funding behind

1391
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
But if you just scratched

1392
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,231
Beneath the surface tiny bit

1393
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
It doesn't

1394
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,279
It's not nefarious

1395
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
It's nefarious

1396
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,095
Military Justice

1397
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
Wants to kill people

1398
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
Call Sears at Arden

1399
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
The culture in order

1400
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,847
Dum dum serial killers who will go round

1401
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,895
That's f****** stupid

1402
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
That is

1403
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,711
That it is on the level of the satanic

1404
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
Agree

1405
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
It is

1406
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Weird to

1407
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,391
I suppose it's not invalid

1408
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
But it is weird to say that

1409
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,279
Violent video games can be a therapeutic

1410
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,839
Element for

1411
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,543
No I mean for soldiers return

1412
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:22,431
But but it is it is strange for video game technology

1413
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Tubi

1414
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Therapeutic element

1415
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
And at the same time

1416
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
Element that

1417
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
People used to descend

1418
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
Sensitise people

1419
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Do you know what I mean

1420
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:35,231
But I'm not sure

1421
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,535
But I also don't think that the way the

1422
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Is it the military

1423
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
Uses the technology

1424
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
Simulation

1425
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
I don't

1426
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
It's to desensitized

1427
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,191
People's Appliance

1428
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:49,823
I think it's just his argument that is is

1429
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
You know it's kind of

1430
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,759
Can boast a double-edged sword

1431
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,063
That's not unreasonable to say

1432
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
But it is hard

1433
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
2

1434
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,671
To make that argument without

1435
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
Connection

1436
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
You don't care

1437
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
His argument is

1438
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
I think that this guy

1439
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
Set up

1440
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:25,151
Finished straws

1441
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,199
Have a built-in narrative

1442
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,759
I just don't think it's come up anytime that we

1443
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
We've been covered

1444
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,855
Yeah I think this is probably a narrative

1445
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
Existed

1446
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,183
Future

1447
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Look like

1448
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Department of

1449
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,911
The violence doesn't pull out very often

1450
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
Not often.

1451
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
I'm so

1452
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
We hear it now

1453
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
What is

1454
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
You taught him how to play

1455
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
Do you think he would feel differently

1456
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:01,759
Video games

1457
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,599
The Alamo

1458
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,183
I'm going to I'm going to play out the life of Colonel Travis

1459
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
And tell him to go f***

1460
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,143
Enjoy this pretend lifestyle you wish you were living

1461
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,007
Gave him to Valley early enough

1462
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:28,127
I'll take all these conspiracy theories and create my own world and all my God

1463
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,455
I will stipulate exactly what

1464
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,479
Is going on

1465
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,391
What my enemies want to do and then flash forward to a prosperous

1466
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,695
Interesting to have him

1467
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,535
Expansion of Steve six which includes climate change

1468
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,887
Yeah yeah includes climate changes like one of the Elementals

1469
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Things that you have to deal with

1470
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
Not available

1471
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
I implanted either

1472
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
My point is that

1473
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
I think we got a new

1474
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
Does narratives that

1475
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
Elusive

1476
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
Was driven out of

1477
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,623
Little hole

1478
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Alex

1479
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
And it's caller says that

1480
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
That the shootings

1481
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Alex

1482
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
Is responses in

1483
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
I think that there's a volume

1484
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Within

1485
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
This 30

1486
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,383
Let's go to Julio in Illinois

1487
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,479
What would drive this

1488
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,879
The son whose father was the vice-president and tax director of General

1489
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:49,279
Trick energy Financial Services

1490
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,191
Suspicious

1491
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,567
I smell something when it's rotten

1492
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
Dammit

1493
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,895
That is the worst f******

1494
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
In response possible

1495
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Because that guy

1496
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Expressing things

1497
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
A big part of the

1498
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,647
Right

1499
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
A response

1500
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
I don't want to go there

1501
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,791
But also

1502
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,327
I smell something when it's rotten

1503
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,191
Right

1504
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,799
That's the thing that he's going to for sure

1505
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
We just had

1506
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
Debates on it

1507
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Argument is like

1508
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,967
I would rather just on the facts and it's like

1509
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:40,991
No you

1510
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,295
Of course not

1511
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,087
Bexar bummer

1512
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,671
That's really break up his entire momentum

1513
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:54,303
Intuit Alex Jones's Whole World falls apart

1514
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
You see glimmers of what I think

1515
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
He wishes he had

1516
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
DMVs episode

1517
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,847
Maybe it's a spiritual memory

1518
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,431
That caller

1519
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
We heard both sides

1520
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:19,135
Right even being like I don't want to go there

1521
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:26,303
He knows that the end result of that is the audience will

1522
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:30,655
F****** ignore the I don't want to go there

1523
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,447
Fart

1524
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,031
In terms of things that we can really nail to the wall

1525
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
He's not

1526
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
He's not super out of line

1527
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,407
Except for all of the other stuff

1528
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:45,503
Yeah makes sense looking at in Sandy Hook

1529
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
Stuff

1530
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,111
He's very clearly signaled he wants

1531
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
What's to do in where he's at

1532
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
But you haven't said the things we

1533
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
We need yet it is it is like

1534
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,047
He is living in a world where he

1535
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,583
Can win that lawsuit

1536
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,887
He can win the current lawsuit

1537
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:05,471
If he is just this guy in 2012 for the

1538
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
These two days

1539
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,335
He can live

1540
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
And backup

1541
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,175
I didn't say this was fake

1542
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,479
I only wanted to have debates

1543
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,319
I had my suspicions because I'm who I am

1544
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,879
But in the world we live in now

1545
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,415
He done f***** up

1546
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,975
And even he knows almost certainly

1547
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,511
That heat

1548
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,119
Alex has version of it is so much like

1549
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
I have the right to Quest

1550
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,471
Babies in incubators and blah blah blah

1551
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
But he's not

1552
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
No

1553
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
He's not talking about like

1554
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
How they were babies in incubators

1555
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,783
To defend himself or why he was

1556
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Sandy Hook

1557
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Folding

1558
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,695
He's not talking about those things but yeah

1559
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
He knows that he doesn't know

1560
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Defend himself

1561
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
Right

1562
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
El Super

1563
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
I know that there is

1564
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,887
The part of it that I haven't

1565
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Detached

1566
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,983
Yeah myself in order to go through all this

1567
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Stars

1568
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,824
This is this does have

1569
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
The feel of

1570
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Somebody

1571
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
In the moment

1572
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
This has the feel of somebody

1573
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Pasta Too

1574
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
Be the guy who says

1575
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
This probably is

1576
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
Like he feels like he has a

1577
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
Ability

1578
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,952
To his list

1579
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,512
To pretend that this

1580
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
To imply

1581
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,096
He doesn't

1582
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Feel like it's not real yet

1583
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,448
You know what I mean like this is

1584
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,776
This is the this is Alex Jones in a lawsuit

1585
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,800
Who can say

1586
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,336
Who's lawyer can say

1587
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
This is an act

1588
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
This is

1589
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,688
This is Alex Jones

1590
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
The presenter

1591
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,296
Who has to do the things

1592
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
Free show

1593
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
You wouldn't have to

1594
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
Find himself a behavioral

1595
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
Over the last two episodes

1596
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Listen to

1597
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,280
Of course like I don't think that there's anything in there that legally action

1598
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
Exactly

1599
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,376
We didn't know that he eventually

1600
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
Does it would be like

1601
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,824
Alex is walking a fine line responsible here

1602
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
But

1603
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,200
Kind of right

1604
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,992
That's on the side of free speech

1605
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,064
You can do whatever you want to do your dick to do it but

1606
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
You did whatever

1607
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
I don't yet

1608
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:36,000
That's what I'm saying but it isn't

1609
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,048
2%

1610
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
Eating in court

1611
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,144
When we know that the Alex Jones

1612
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
Is the one from 2015 saying

1613
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:51,360
It's fake episode

1614
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,920
Really sharp focus is because

1615
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,968
Feedback from the last episode

1616
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Talk to

1617
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Lawyers

1618
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:02,112
About some stuff

1619
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
Yeah

1620
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
They know that

1621
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,328
Yeah I meant third everything that were talking about

1622
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,864
Is outside of the statue

1623
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,424
Even him in 2015

1624
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Keep saying it

1625
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
Listen FedEx

1626
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
Completely directors

1627
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,800
I thought they were kids who died there but

1628
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824
Turns out their work

1629
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
All that s***

1630
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,152
That is still outside

1631
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Limitations

1632
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,688
For defamation

1633
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,224
Yeah

1634
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Being students

1635
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
So there isn't a real /

1636
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
Productive reason

1637
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
Bring this to the

1638
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
Conversation

1639
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
Yeah

1640
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,280
These are these are episodes that are

1641
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,560
Find some online

1642
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
Like I had

1643
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Had to dig through the

1644
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,168
Like I'm DJ

1645
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
Trip or something

1646
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,200
DJ Cosi

1647
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,880
20 albums of last year

1648
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,672
It's good but I didn't have to dig

1649
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
Too far to find

1650
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
It's available

1651
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Due diligence

1652
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,328
If they're stewing Alex

1653
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,864
Jones about what he said about

1654
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,656
They know what the fuc

1655
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,448
He said right

1656
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,216
At this time

1657
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,496
They know it's not

1658
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,264
Legally action

1659
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,824
It's important for their case

1660
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
Yeah they would know.

1661
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,384
To be aware of it

1662
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,920
So I don't

1663
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,200
I don't I don't have any

1664
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Real interesting

1665
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Entirely

1666
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Human

1667
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
Intellectual

1668
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
Yeah

1669
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,904
Just understanding what he was doing

1670
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
How is Brian work

1671
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464
How

1672
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
How does a person

1673
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
Fall into

1674
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,048
Exactly

1675
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,864
How do you go from Vista

1676
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,656
Where it's clear that he wrecked

1677
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Nice is 50

1678
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
People died

1679
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
2

1680
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,240
Whatever version of

1681
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Yeah

1682
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,224
Want fire show to be successful in the

1683
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
Stoked about a day jobs

1684
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,648
There is also a

1685
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
Certain aspect of this

1686
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
That I find

1687
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,768
So relevant to posterity

1688
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:21,888
Like a win-win when the fish people

1689
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
Take over

1690
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:24,960
25 years

1691
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:30,848
I hope they listen to the show and recognize what propagated

1692
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:41,344
The Deep

1693
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,624
Houses rsf

1694
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:47,232
So we won't be able to find out

1695
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
Great graphic novels

1696
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
It's very

1697
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,424
Foreign territory for us to

1698
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
Because the

1699
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
We've done

1700
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:03,360
Taking so long

1701
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
Yeah

1702
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,736
Knowing a whole lot more

1703
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
Larger context

1704
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
Text Ryan.

1705
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:14,112
Where is the second

1706
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Of looking

1707
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
2012

1708
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,976
December 2012

1709
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
It's

1710
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
It's more

1711
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
So even though

1712
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,864
We know Alex

1713
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
There's so much

1714
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
That like

1715
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
We got to get

1716
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
100

1717
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
Percent there yet

1718
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
We're still doing

1719
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,592
Too much speculate

1720
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,640
I don't think is wrong

1721
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,688
But it's not

1722
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
It's not where I want to be

1723
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
Piece of pie

1724
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
Getting in the pool

1725
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
You never know what you're diving in

1726
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
Weave

1727
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
Committed

1728
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
We'll find out what the waters like when we

1729
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,048
It's it's just that

1730
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,840
Dead center in between

1731
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,888
Dar 2009 investor

1732
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936

1733
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,240
And yet somehow this

1734
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
Completely different

1735
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,152
I'm get it just like I do

1736
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,968
Right is somebody the same built-in defense

1737
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Distrusting

1738
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Psych meds

1739
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Vaccine

1740
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,488
Orient ourselves

1741
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,328
Yeah

1742
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Response

1743
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,120

1744
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,144
Severe circumstance

1745
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,704
And just

1746
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
He is at this

1747
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,544
Cuz we haven't heard from

1748
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Yeah

1749
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,456
So we will learn more

1750
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Experience this

1751
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
I'm glad it's not ugly

1752
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,512
Maybe another f****** will find out

1753
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,376
Before that

1754
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Website

1755
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,424

1756
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,752

1757
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:11,104
If you are a big

1758
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:17,504
John Wayne's and it's also feel your hand. I think we got to get rid of it

1759
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:23,136
John Wayne

1762
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
Which was filled with

1763
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,680
People and we hope that

1764
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:38,752

You know what

1772
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,280
A lot of Nazi zombies

1773
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,424
In the video game

1774
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,728
But

1775
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,776
No I know

1776
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,312
Technically probably

1777
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,616
In the real world

1778
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,640
May have killed a guy

1779
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
