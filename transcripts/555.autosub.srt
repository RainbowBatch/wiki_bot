1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
To get together drink novelty beverages worship at the Carlton

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
Celine or the altar of Celine

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Smooth intro

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Alex

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
I will

10
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Jordan

11
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,200
Nice to meet you

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,880
Remember pleasantries out of the way

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
Might be obviously the release of my super secret project

14
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Posey want John

15
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Believe it

16
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
John

17
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Probably

18
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Handwriting might be an issue with John

19
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Say if you are someone with bad handwriting who sent us

20
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Pathfinder rulebook

21
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
To you later Rubik's and all sorts of other

22
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
Like figurine let me not cool not like

23
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
You know it's not like a Warhammer figure he's a little stand

24
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Campaigns all this really cool stuff

25
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,176
Figure that one out eventually

26
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
Just to give a little behind the scene until

27
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
I got overwhelmed

28
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Bye

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
The number of

30
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
And I said Jordan pisses on you

31
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,024
You lyrics

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
You need to finally do sober

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
This is your job now

34
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Figure out what to do with it

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
I couldn't handle the idea of using cracking one of those books

36
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
And then getting lost

37
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Because I probably would

38
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
No one needs that

39
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Yeah I rather

40
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
It's very hard to do

41
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
So we

42
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
We decided to do as close to a Pathfinder

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Champagne suppliers by this

44
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Yeah yeah

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
So we've got you then we've got our brilliant friend

46
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,656
Marty and Sarah love wrestling and then we have the lovely and talented

47
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,240
Who is absolutely fantastic and we are all playing

48
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Campaign that I wrote

49
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
Yeah

50
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
I mean we're not really playing

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
In the game

52
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
Yeah the first episode of it is on our patreon right now but it's not like

53
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Unpaywall record

54
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
Just a reminder everything on our patreon

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
Behind

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Projects in Gasport

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Yeah but

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,704
Wings places

59
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
Joyfully this kind of dovetails into my brakes by first of all of him semi bright spot I really did enjoy

60
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
It's great

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
It's certainly outside of the realm of what I normally am

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
I'm comfortable with in terms of

63
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Airplane characters or whatever but

64
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Everyone character is so fun silly together a bunch of middle-aged people who have never

65
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,959
Stand-up City

66
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
I am excited to see where it goes

67
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Also in relation to this

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Pathfinder books

69
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Everything's game

70
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
I realize that we you need

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Catch up a little bit on

72
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
The mailbag yeah we were going to do like some more bonus episodes we haven't really been able

73
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
Go to bradlyn now this secret project has been unveiled

74
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Begin that's behind

75
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,095
Zip the mailbox

76
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Characters

77
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
From a bar at the same time

78
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,847
We are not going to make Thomas the devil

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
Come after anybody

80
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Also Jordans

81
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
We're we missed this one a little ways back

82
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Who sent that to a little poster of likes

83
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
Chicago venues

84
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Yeah it's that you do all that

85
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Another person hear a Sara M

86
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,287
Excited about this thing that came in a little while back

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
I was asked

88
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Some honeys

89
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
They were there there

90
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Metal honey

91
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
Is the name of the company

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
I see honey in like a really

93
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
The floury Elixir one

94
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
They're fantastic and so I wanted to say thank you to Sarah

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Thanks for those

96
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
And also the hot sauce of the month

97
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
His continued to roll an absolutely delightful

98
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
I don't think we've had a Doug some of not been as good as others

99
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,055
But I got to say this this one the Marie Sharp's the other habanero 14

100
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
From Belize

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
They came in

102
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Pat is Ben

103
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Sweetie those ones are pretty in my wheelhouse yeah

104
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
In terms of like an everyday sauce those have been

105
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Been pretty

106
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Pretty heavy in the rotation

107
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,975
I feel like there was actually one in autos of the month it was kind of disappointing but I don't remember what it was

108
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
There was one called Illuminati

109
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Like a naughty like that

110
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
I don't think I like that one

111
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Maybe it was just bitter about the pain though

112
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,103
Are you being unless you were in the illuminate let you know like unless you were like Jay-Z or Beyonce I don't think it's

113
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Defense

114
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,223
Do you know I also I also should say this came with some X

115
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Can pandas figure out the honeys

116
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
So cool thing that apparently is a signature of the metal honey brand

117
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Would you have course I certainly need more candy

118
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Repeat cast

119
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,887
That's what they're going for also I'm way overdue checking the mailbox

120
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
They're probably some more coming up in the near future

121
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Jordans

122
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
We got an episode

123
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
Yeah we do and I got to say

124
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
It was difficult

125
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
To decide what

126
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
To do

127
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
And I want to walk

128
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
You threw my thinking

129
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,295
The first thing I thought of was I don't care about Alex's take

130
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Akon Bill Gates getting

131
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
I don't care about anything to do with Bill Gates getting a divorce I think it might be interesting to see him try and weave that in

132
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
To somehow it's part of the globalist

133
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Why I'm sure

134
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
I don't I don't know I don't

135
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
I think it's also a little bit

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
No matter what it'll be disappointing

137
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
I don't care for it much

138
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,847
I also started to realize that like our show right now is becoming like

139
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
How much does

140
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Goddamn anti-vaxxer

141
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Like

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
OneNote

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
To certain extent

144
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
I got I get I get

145
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
I just burped

146
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Buy it

147
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
At the same time

148
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Sure we've been looking

149
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
2003

150
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Had a realization

151
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
You know where we are in 2003

152
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
May

153
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Yeah

154
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
May 7th

155
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Which is the Davis episode comes out

156
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
What is a rare opportunity

157
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,079
If we go back to 2003 today we can cover something 18 years ago to the day

158
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Okay well now we have

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
I felt like I had to

160
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,991
Yeah there's nothing we can do but that so today we're going over May 7th

161
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
2003

162
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
Everything the music was revolutionary it was happening people are having meaningful conversations

163
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Alma Street

164
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
2003

165
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
The heady time in America

166
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,775
3 Stankonia or the love below

167
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,663
I want to watch that was around then around that but I could be wrong

168
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Outkast albums in case you were wondering

169
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
Think it might have been

170
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
When was Bombs Over Baghdad wideout was Adam

171
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
That was

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
That was

173
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,839
I don't know

174
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Bombs Over Baghdad

175
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,495
Okay will do probably around 2000

176
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
I'm more of a the time in my life that I would consider the salad days are these southernplayalisticadillacmuzik

177
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
That's really where I live

178
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Fair not fair

179
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Tomorrow

180
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
Get down to business on our trip to the Past

181
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
Looks like a little more Jordan to say what up

182
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Does new walk

183
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
So first written Hannah this is for you

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,007
This is for you the goddamn

185
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
The shadow to you Jordan because of baseball season

186
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
The goddamn Pac-Man wanted me to let you know go Padres

187
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
You're not about to walk

188
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm a policy wonk goddamn Pac-Man

189
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
Know the Padres are

190
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
Fernando tatis is one of the most exciting and probably maybe the best player and they stole you do well when I say

191
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
Do you Darvish from the Cubs what I mean more as the Rick

Ricketts family through you Darvish into the ocean and was like San Diego you can have him

193
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
For peanuts

194

Dad

195
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519

198
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Sprinkler

199
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
The parrotheads

200
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
I resisted this

201
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Shoutout mostly because Mike has

202
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Secret agenda

203
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
Night is to see what kind of overlap there is

204
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Between our podcast Phantom

205
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Jimmy Buffett fans and I'd rather not know

206
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
I hope not too

207
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
Next

208
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
Next

209
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Technocrat

210
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
Alright William P thank you so much

211
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
And also

212
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
The baby Blaze

213
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
What's about Blaise

214
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
The baby Blaze

215
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Who is a punk

216
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
You're not with seconds

217
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Business

218
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Money off that heroin

219
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Freakishly large

220
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,895
Blaze

221
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
I don't know why I've lost my mind I just had to double-check again

222
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,527
Of course it's not on Stankonia it's on Bob

223
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
It's on babe Bombs Over Baghdad

224
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
What am I stupid feel like I'm losing my mind

225
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
Okay

226
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,327
So Jordan we start here at the beginning of the day the show as Alex

227
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
To the beginning

228
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
And I have got this

229
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Pieces that I'm working on.

230
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Continues

231
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
To see more and more accurate

232
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
And that is that

233
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
Joe Rogan stole the word powerful from Alex

234
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,503
Broadcast

235
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Rihanna

236
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
If you were born on the date of this episode was recorded you can

237
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Vote

238
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Best powerful

239
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Powerful

240
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,167
I've never done what would this what say

241
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
18th

242
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Anniversary what would that be in any

243
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Well I don't I don't know.

244
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
What do you mean

245
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Well I mean The Aviator Millennium is 1018 while he'll

246
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
People without their aid

247
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,439
I thought you meant like going to like it's a paper anniversary or like a gold

248
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
What's the what what's that one

249
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Think I don't know

250
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Papyrus

251
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
I'm not in that list

252
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
There's a

253
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
The spatula here

254
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
I mean I could look

255
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
I could check

256
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
I don't care

257
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
Undoubtedly. Acclaim

258
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
You could take Joe Rogan

259
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Going to small claims court for stealing

260
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
The intro of a show because of the powerful tree

261
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
Transmission you know I think they've gotten a lot from each other out of this situation

262
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
Text can be mad at Joe for what he's

263
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,607
Contributed in raid response for getting powerful

264
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Furthers

265
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Argument that I hate to say I kind of agree with this show is a sneaky snake

266
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Petro powerful Sneaky Snake

267
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Okay get rid of Alex

268
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,087
Alex has powerful over him could be

269
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
This might be looking to discover but I think we might have figured out

270
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,375
We got it we did a ruption age

271
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
This is why there's an intellectual dark web

272
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
JoJo stealing the word powerful

273
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Oh well

274
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Let's get into something

275
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
It's a little more meaty

276
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,807
By now admit the privately

277
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
The doctor

278
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,567
So for the last few days here in 2003 Alex has been touching on the story of the alleged Rescue of private Lynch

279
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,991
Exact position but it doesn't seem like there's much here passport

280
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Saturday night clip

281
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
His position is that the rescue was all just

282
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Hollywood theatrics and nothing

283
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
And more

284
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
The story of private land is actually a saint

285
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,255
Plastic example of the precise problem with what Alex Jones does for a living

286
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
And how easy it is to get seduced

287
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Austin his way of thinking

288
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
For some background on March 23rd 2003 Lynch's Convoy was ambushed outside

289
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Arena Rock

290
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
And she was taking off

291
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
11 of the other members of our group were killed in the Ambush and Lynch was taken to nearby Saddam

292
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
There she was treated

293
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
And on the evening of April 1st

294
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
She was rescued by US forces

295
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
From this point forward the story is one of

296
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Sweet malpractice by the media

297
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
Where's sensationalism LED coverage

298
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
The story

299
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,255
Unnamed sources claim that you've been shot or stabbed but

300
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
What do reports came out

301
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Doctors who said

302
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Such wounds

303
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Even as media Outlets ran with us

304
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Sensationalize version the story other out

305
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
We're digging in

306
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
What was

307
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
And was not the truth

308
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
April 15th Outlet like the washing

309
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,919
Good post for beginning to critically examine their own initial coverage

310
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
And questioned whether their account was accurate

311
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Washington Post headline

312
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Whoops

313
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
Really should have done a better job on that one

314
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
More or less

315
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Yeah it's

316
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
It's interesting and gradually

317
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
Things fell apart in the truth of matter came forward

318
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,047
When Lynch was taken to Saddam hospital she was given appropriate medic

319
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
Local treatment and when US forces arrived to rescue her

320
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
There weren't any wrecking forces there and much of

321
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
To the characterization of her is a rainbow type

322
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Was based on Overdrive

323
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
What is Asian and misstatement

324
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
It's absolutely true that much of the media can play

325
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
F*** this story up

326
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
Horses that were pretty excited

327
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
But they were f****** it up

328
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,831
The war in Iraq at that point was not full of good news

329
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
I like the bush administrative

330
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Administration would have wanted it

331
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,559
To be any idea that they would try to take this story and use it for their purposes definitely seems like what they did

332
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
If you read the house report that investigated the

333
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
The flow of information about the rest

334
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
Skew titled house report 1 10-8 58

335
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
You can definitely see instances of members of the Department of

336
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
Defense giving inaccurate information about the rescue

337
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Which fed into the heroic drama that was

338
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Was being sold by the media

339
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Are you telling me that warmongering politicians

340
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,207
I'm not telling you that I'm not

341
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
And I think that's important

342
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
But in this report that there's one in

343
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
It's on April 2nd a brigadier general

344
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Send Brooks a spokesperson for

345
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Centcom

346
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Told a press briefing quote

347
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
There was not a firefight outside the building I will tell you but there were fire fights outside of the building getting in and getting out

348
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
That was not true

349
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Unless you take a very Broad

350
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
View of what

351
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Getting in and getting out

352
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
Well we started the war a couple of months

353
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
Citgo fire fights for us

354
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,767
And then whenever she left

355
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:42,143
April 3rd Navy Captain Frank Thorp was quoted in the military time to saying that Lynch quote

356
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
We do have very

357
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
Strong indications that Jessica Lynch was not captured very easily

358
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383
Reports are that you fired for M16 rifle until she had no more ammunition

359
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
None of that information is accurate but if

360
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Feeds into the creation of a story out of the movies

361
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Republic to enjoy

362
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Lechona

363
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Tell me another

364
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
That was another thing that was in that house investigation

365
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Misinformation

366
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Surrounding

367
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
The thing is

368
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Those people

369
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
And their statement

370
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
Brigadier General Brook

371
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
And navy captain

372
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
Are not necessarily the people who gave

373
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
The statements are named to the washing

374
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
It's not

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Like these people statement

376
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
As inaccurate as they may be

377
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
Are what fueled directly through media sensationalism

378
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Anyone

379
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Possible to prove this definitively

380
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
But you'd also have to be kind of naive

381
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
To think that it's

382
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Impossible that someone within the department of

383
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
I've seen the potential

384
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Spin the story

385
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
For some much-needed good press for the war

386
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
You could have that suspicion

387
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
And you can point fingers at the media for bungling the story

388
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
If you do that you have to be careful about where you

389
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Appointment

390
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,199
If you damn the media for their mishandling of this story you also have to

391
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Credit the media for doubling back in quest

392
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Reminder own coverage with new information came to light

393
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
This doesn't necessarily excuse the sensationalism

394
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
The characterize the initial coverage

395
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
But without actual journalists continuant

396
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
What do the story

397
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
Even if it meant embarrassing themselves

398
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
This bread would have been much harder to untag

399
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Second

400
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:23,519
If you believe that the dod was definitely trying to pull propaganda games here and pushing the false story

401
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
You have to ask how good they are at

402
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,943
This was a relatively easy propaganda story to pull off and it fell apart in a matter of weeks

403
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
If you believe that this was all government spin

404
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
Then I would suggest this story serves as a

405
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
The terrible argument that the government

406
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
It's always lying to us

407
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Kind of more firmly supports the idea that

408
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
When the government tries to lie on a scale like this

409
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
It doesn't work

410
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
What's up in people's faces

411
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
You know at the time they just lied their way into a war so I bet they weren't really caring too much

412
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Much about whether or not everybody

413
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Caught them lying

414
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
I mean and then as far as

415
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
The competence with which they do things go

416
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,551
They are just incompetently lied their way into a war that they were fighting incompetently they were

417
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Still fighting in comp

418
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
So it would make sense to me that the

419
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
The government

420
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
As it was

421
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Set the time

422
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Would very much try and push

423
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
The story so incompetently that it would backfire

424
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Pinterest

425
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Most

426
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,471
Something about this in the most important aspect to really

427
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Delve into is where one thinks

428
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
The conspiracy

429
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,151
I don't fault people for thinking that the Bush Administration would have

430
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
The vested interest in The Sensational version of the story being reported

431
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
And the possibly unnamed us officials

432
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Fed the flames

433
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
The story to the media

434
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
So you can suspect

435
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
I know that they may be wanted to mediate

436
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
This wrong in this

437
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
That's a different thing than the narrative italicus

438
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
The story that Alex is telling us that the entire rescue operation

439
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
In itself was a contrived theatrical Affair which is

440
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Wheatley unsupported by the

441
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,007
The dod Office of the Inspector General Kentucky

442
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,103
Did investigation due to the insistence of Rahm Emanuel of all people

443
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Into the allegation

444
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,943
Seems that the rescue is quote premeditated fabrication

445
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
From the report

446
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,831
Based on the results of the preliminary inquiry conducted by the Inspector General

447
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
United States Central Command

448
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
We can concluded that the allegations were not

449
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Substantiated that no further investigation

450
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Was warranted

451
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
During the inquiry the inspector-general uscentcom review numerous classified operational documents that were not available to the media

452
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,496
And interviewed over 30 Witnesses many of whom had firsthand knowledge of the events

453
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
A tissue

454
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,872
In addition to this Vernon low but one of the writers of the first Washington Post

455
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Story

456
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
The actual first one the dead office in Station live coverage

457
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,784
He was interviewed on NPR's fresh air in December 2000

458
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
3

459
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,368
In that interview he clarifies that the information he was getting that the

460
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,208
The story was based on was wrong but It ultimately traced back to bad intelligence

461
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
From the field

462
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Inaccurate information was

463
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
Conveyed collected from intercept

464
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Misrepresented and misinterpreted details

465
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
I meant that story was reported

466
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Kind of

467
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
Puts a little bit of a hole

468
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
In the theory that like is all an elaborate

469
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Miss handling

470
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
And if you want to get a conspiracy about like

471
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Hey

472
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
It works in certain

473
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
People's best interest

474
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
That there was this Miss handling

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
That's not crazy

476
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
It seems

477
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Almost

478
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
The impossible to think of it as anything other than opportunistic

479
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Idiot

480
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
Bungling

481
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Murder story

482
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,424
You know you're a war hero store if you want to keep it in that sort of territory

483
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
You're on

484
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
More

485
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Like not

486
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,336
Totally unreasonable ground

487
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Cuz doing it

488
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
This idea that it's

489
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
They had premeditated intentions

490
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Zup creating this fake rescue

491
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
In order to trick people into

492
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
Supporting the war or whatever

493
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,208
This is a conclusion that is unearned unsubstantiated

494
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
You can't back this up any

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
It's nonsense

496
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
And if this is

497
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Point that I'm trying to make

498
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
When you have this

499
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Suspicion

500
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
And this like

501
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,240
I don't know I don't trust these people pushing a f****** war and this story it

502
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
Like it was mishandled

503
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Some level

504
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
Inaccurate statements were made weather is

505
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Because of bad information being

506
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,504
Conveyed to the people making the statements or

507
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Some kind of

508
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah Miss handling

509
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Who knows

510
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
That suspicion is not bad

511
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
No it's not

512
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
Unnatural to have that healthy distrust

513
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
Distrust gets transmuted by someone like Alex

514
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Into conflict

515
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Assertions

516
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Of

517
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Conclusion that is

518
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
Based in reality

519
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
And that's where the danger is

520
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Even with this

521
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
2003 Alex this

522
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
It's a far different Alex than the present

523
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
In terms of

524
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Some of his methodology

525
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
That is true

526
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
I mean

527
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
But it's just so

528
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
It's just so

529
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Easy

530
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Especially at the time

531
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
Because they literally lied us into a war that

532
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Never going to

533
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
The end

534
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
That's a conspiracy

535
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
On the level of something that is so

536
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Huge

537
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,752
I mean an actual

538
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
Invasion of another country

539
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
And it was a conspiracy

540
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
And it was a lie

541
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,432
That it's hard to imagine anything's Beyond those

542
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
People you know

543
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
Why would

544
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
What do you really think it's

545
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,856
Beyond the people who lied us into a Forever War

546
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,160
To fabricate one small thing

547
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
You know like that seems like a reasonable over-reaction

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
At the time

549
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
If that makes sense do you know what I'm saying

550
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
Right but what you're describing is essentially Alec

551
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
What's Jones is

552
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Indoctrination

553
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Yes it is

554
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
It is

555
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Compelling

556
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Sing and

557
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
It certainly could be persuasive to say what

558
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
Related acts why wouldn't they do

559
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Something else

560
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
And that's fine but then

561
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Alright

562
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Any argument

563
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
It's gone like yeah

564
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
Why wouldn't they do

565
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Do you like to justify 100

566
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Conspiracies

567
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
And it's just

568
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
It doesn't work

569
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,912
Yeah I know I don't I don't think there's any way prove that someone is morally capable of an act

570
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
I absolutely agree

571
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
Hijack is what Alex uses

572
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Sprite

573
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
They are morally

574
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
Capable

575
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
Bratz

576
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Just not that's not

577
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Not reality

578
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Yeah it's hard not to think that

579
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
History is going to look

580
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Get the Bush Administration

581
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
As

582
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
Infinitely worse than anything Trump ever did

583
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
It's hard to look that it's hard to think that history won't look at Bush as one of

584
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
The single worst

585
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Genocider there's ever been

586
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,312
Feels like Trump has sometime last though that's true that's true he we will see if he can still catch up

587
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Interesting

588
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Predictions that he make

589
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
This episode that seemed

590
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Reminiscent

591
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
The present day

592
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
And they're preparing a national draft

593
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Program

594
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Environmental

595
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,928
We've been in the new world order for twenty years yeah

596
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Yeah

597
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
No it just it just occurred to me that

598
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
It's like when he says

599
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
All of these things and then

600
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,168
They don't happen and he's like see we stopped it

601
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Like

602
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Yeah but now I

603
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
You've been foiling the same plot

604
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,432
420 yes we're reading like Batman serialized

605
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,064
Put in the draft and I was going to have tattletale Squad Batman Obama was going to have a draft

606
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,184
Exactly Obama youth or whatever

607
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
The Joker back in Arkham Asylum and then a week later

608
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
Joker breaks out with the same plant

609
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
And there's a whole lot of immediacy every time every single time

610
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,520
The only difference I would say is that within the world of DC Comics

611
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
The Batman and Joker

612
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Purdue exam

613
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
Is that man was making up over and over again

614
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,880
And did not possess the creativity to come up with new plan you have got a new take on the Batman

615
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Main character it's a rich

616
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,048
Psychopath who is inventing supervillains in order to play out this massive fantasy

617
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
That he has

618
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Is it being a superhero

619
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,400
Oh my God that sounds real

620
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
I know I know a guy who could write that

621
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
For you

622
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800
At this point in 2000

623
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Three there were some

624
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Beginnings of

625
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Democratic processes

626
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
Being attempted

627
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
The God within a rock

628
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Bandai Alex has some

629
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Interesting takes on

630
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
Relieved

631
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Been there Hitman

632
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Will

633
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,888
Northern

634
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,592
Able to find articles and Outlets like the New York Times and LA Times about the Mosel election

635
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Formerly made

636
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
2003

637
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
That they have is a lot more

638
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Restrain that Alex's

639
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Presenting at

640
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
The New York Times article starts like that

641
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Rock tickets

642
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
Its first faltering step toward democracy

643
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
See today when

644
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,464
Technically diverse group of local leaders held an election to choose an interim government

645
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
In this North

646
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Northern City Iraq

647
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Third largest

648
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
They're boarding recognizes it as a first step in

649
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
In a process not necessarily the end result

650
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Itself where is

651
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
I feel like Alex is trying to pretend that the media is saying that this is a job that

652
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,080
You like The News-Herald wasn't does agent so I

653
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
The CIA or whatever the

654
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
The fuk Alex's

655
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
It was a group of

656
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
240 tribal leaders and local resident

657
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,552
Groups that make up the population of the area

658
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
These 240 selected a group of

659
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
24 council members who then went on to

660
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
To choose a mayor

661
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,304
I'm not going to pretend that I know whether or not this was the best way to handle the preliminary election for an inch

662
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Interim government

663
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
But my point is

664
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
From everything I can tell Alex is misrepresenting what's going on

665
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,472
It's great to be opposed to the war

666
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
Cuz you should be

667
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Your opposition to be base

668
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
In reality

669
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
I don't I don't feel like there's a lot of

670
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Dealing with the war as a

671
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
It exists

672
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
On his part

673
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
Yeah yeah

674
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
It seems like if you don't deal with such a massive

675
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Thing going on and instead

676
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Create Toc

677
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Toxic

678
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,696
Conspiracy theories about it that

679
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Push people towards the

680
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
The far-right I bet that's going to have repercussions later on

681
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Yeah I don't

682
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
I don't think it was the right way to express opposition later on we're really going to find out that the

683
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,288
Results of those things combining are really going to be bad for us

684
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
I think my parents

685
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
Friends who were hippies

686
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
Might have had a better handle on

687
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Expedia

688
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
So

689
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,784
You know I do last episode about 2003 I think maybe it's too bad

690
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Alex

691
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Was going to go to Missouri to do a radio with

692
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
So foreign from

693
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Alex is Pres

694
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Keep telling the truth

695
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,952
Power everything else

696
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:33,632
I kind of believe that he probably would turned out of money to do a radio

697
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
Yeah

698
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Yeah it doesn't it doesn't

699
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,984
Fuel insincere

700
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
I don't like it I don't like it Dan but I do buy it

701
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
I think I believe him here

702
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:47,200
I don't know though I don't

703
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
2003-4 think there's a possibility that he has reason to believe he can make more money selling DVDs any

704
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
Whatever his appearance rate

705
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
It's still a calculation

706
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
Maybe baby

707
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,632
Is lowered lowball enough that it's your pride would be better off

708
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656
Denying it

709
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
You're an infant take

710
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,360
Apparently he was willing to go for free to a radio event in Missouri back in 2003

711
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
That's intense

712
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
So at this point

713
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Alex

714
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
Not only going to radio event

715
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
For free he's also doing

716
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
The work he's doing the like

717
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
A lot of work

718
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
You want your order

719
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
Infowars.com

720
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Decided

721
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
That it's been too long since we've done a documentary

722
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
And

723
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
As we're back in 2003 Alex just released this documentary

724
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,440
Oh not you like it's perfect time and we've got it we've got to cover police-state we're going to cover police

725
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,256

00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
I got I got I got this you know

727
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
Is that wind energy of

728
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
Was that the one whenever a bobcat

729
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
Was it his star was really starting to wane down after

730
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
23 was that the one

731
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,360

Also

Just do me

00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
The idea of going online

741
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Add pudding

742
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Dramatic

743
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
Documentary titles such as police

744
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
3 into your leg

00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Order cart

746

00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Police state 3

748
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
Clicking by like you got to smell like that it got kind of feel like s*** if you're not buying please say 2 + 10

749
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Important

750
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,560
Chanel knows that serialized are we going to miss it out I don't know but if we do cover it

751
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,608
Not doing the other one

752
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Super background

753
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Don't know if I'm going to

754
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,472
This point Jordan wood

755
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
We know in the future

756
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Alex's enemies

757
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,664
Oh boy the list is ongoing

758
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,856
Literal demon minions of the devil

759
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
Interesting Lee here is who the new world order is in 2003

760
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Mine

761
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
My wife

762
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,168
My

763
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,504
The European

764
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
Does European bankers

765
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Is the New World Order

766
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
Not too and that's what my chair the devil

767
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,232
The literal literal Christian devil

768
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
I mean it's nice that

769
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
We haven't seen the enemy at our gate

770
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
So to speak

771
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,776
I think it's interesting how he's

772
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
We have visitors

773
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Is this bastard looseness

774
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Yeah

775
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
What do you actually think I don't know

776
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
I don't know

777
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
I don't know

778
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
I don't know

779
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,368
I don't either I don't know interesting about this because we know in the future he will

780
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
Be fighting

781
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,232
Yeah and there's some slight indications that we've seen for 2003

782
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
He seems to Victor's

783
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,400
International

784
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
European Banker

785
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,544
Which is which is exactly the sort of presentation that he wants people to death

786
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,384
This is about the Federal Reserve this is about fiat currency

787
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
You know this is

788
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
I don't know I want to know if he

789
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Actually thinks

790
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
The devil back then

791
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
I kind of think that they are here's what I figured

792
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
All right here's what I'm going to go with

793
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,768
I'm going to go with its necessary escalation is what happened you know like

794
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,328
Iron Man came out around 2000

795
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,192
You know it's just one dude fighting against his is

796
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Director

797
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Or whatever it is he's doing

798
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,848
Real low-stakes by the end of it we've got to restart the universe

799
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
You know it's like

800
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,992
Call European Bankers are at and then 20 years later

801
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
We're fighting the literal devil

802
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
It makes sense

803
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah but look

804
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
Dude if he's essentially doing the entire Marvel universe as we

805
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
In an Ironman

806
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:26,656
Like Robert Downey jr. wasn't pretending that he wasn't fighting Santos

807
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
He didn't know he was fighting Thanos

808
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,592
Alex seems to have some awareness of the devil

809
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
There is that

810
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,248
Santos didn't hatches plan for another 10 years or whatever

811
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
I can't quite get my finger on it yet

812
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,880
So Alex Goes to call Sandy Texas

813
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Let's talk about

814
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Dennis Miller sure great

815
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
I just do I sell them

816
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Tonight Show last night

817
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Dennis Miller

818
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Was on there

819
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
And I always seem to I mean

820
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
Real quick Ultra socialist

821
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,320
She was on The Tonight Show

822
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
Praise and accolades

823
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Fair enough

824
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Yeah I mean

825
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Football

826
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,392
I think I might have been a few years earlier

827
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
This this is

828
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,584
Sure promoted the Iraq war is Shameless

829
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
I think time has shown us a date

830
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
He's stayed on that

831
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
Conservative pathan was pretty in favor of trump follow-up followed a lot of similar path

832
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,688
This is a secret socialist

833
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
Ultra-left person

834
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Trying to

835
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Tend to be conservative

836
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
You know the Trojan Horse

837
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
George Bush on us

838
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
That explanation that doesn't make sense

839
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Tonight site

840
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Dick lost

841
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
His mind

842
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Yeah yeah real dick

843
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Real

844
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
Sites to know that no matter what era we live in

845
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
Right-wing commentators will still have

846
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
Very strong opinions about,

847
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Don't matter

848
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
It's pretty Universal in

849
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
No one like that

850
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Coupler

851
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
What about interaction that did not

852
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
It's not globalist in a hot tub

853
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
It seems to be a

854
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
Nazi at a gas station

855
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Jokes

856
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Don't think this happen

857
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
About

858
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
You're not part of the

859
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
North Korea

860
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,216
From at least 2010 onward all the way to his running for President Donald Trump was

861
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,312
Wheatley preoccupied with the idea of taking oil from countries where we've been at War

862
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,408
An editor's note in an article from The Brookings Institute called it quote

863
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,016
The most dangerous and irresponsible of all the republican nominees policy proposals

864
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
Ben Alex Justified it when Trump had the egg

865
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Exact same perspective

866
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
You shooting down his dumb basheer 2003

867
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,952
Also I think it's

868
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Weird

869
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
That Alex is saying that

870
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
Being a Nazi is trendy

871
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
2003

872
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
I don't know what kind of company he's Swinging with back then but

873
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
Honestly

874
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
For Alex

875
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Add that guy was ahead

876
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
Give the time

877
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,895
It's really he was out at the Forefront of

878
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
Absolutely loved the right way

879
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Eventual cleavage

880
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,623
Kerouac of the of the beat movie you know he's there early

881
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
That's Tuff

882
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
Yeah I just don't like the idea of

883
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
Looking at somebody with an iron cross tattoo

884
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
F****** Brandi

885
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,399
I look at my friends who were too into Tiger King

886
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Absolutely

887
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
F*** either that or he's just like I'll look at you

888
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:29,247
So many goddamn Nazis with their iron cross tattoos everywhere these days

889
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,855
I'm lately bell bottom right

890
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Text fad

891
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
So I think it one of the things that I keep

892
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Keep getting a sense of

893
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,023
And these two thousand three episodes

894
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,607
Is a lot of Alex's opposition to George Bush comes down to

895
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Complete feeling that bushes

896
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
She's going to take all of his guns

897
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,383
2 also known as the Justice enhancement domestic

898
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,199
Security Act of 2003 was introduced by Tom daschle

899
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
On January 7th 2003

900
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
They probably died

901
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
For even receiving about

902
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,695
Clinton signed the federal assault weapons ban in 1994 Sunset Clause after

903
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
After 10 years so it was abandoned only

904
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Existed

905
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,583
Until 2004 when Obi re-examined

906
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,375
And it expired in 2004

907
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Bush did not renew

908
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
None of these listeners scared of

909
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Happened which is

910
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Kind of the case always

911
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Yeah

912
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Yeah

913
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Well distraction

914
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Turn the stuff that is

915
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
You don't want to get in

916
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
The waves real

917
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
It hurt true

918
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
So

919
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
That's why you don't make Shadow gay

920
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
Dan you don't get in the way of the real stuff

921
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,191
Whatever you do don't talk about Rodger

922
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
This account takes another call

923
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
And this guy has a perspective of like

924
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,919
You know we're over there we're trying to bring tomorrow

925
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Proceed into the Middle East countries in

926
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
What have you and I don't see anything happening here

927
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
Don't see anything happening in my life

928
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
And whatever

929
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
Alex do something really f***** up after that

930
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
You said before

931
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
Ha he keeps saying it trouble

932
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
You know what's funny that you meant

933
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Nothing about

934
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
People scaring in the

935
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
How I was thinking

936
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
3 days ago

937
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Into my head

938
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Wait a minute

939
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
Benefiting The General

940
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
Population of the

941
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
What's going on

942
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
I stopped and I looked around

943
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Gas prices

944
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
To the store. Advise a Wawa

945
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,591
Disabled

946
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
It's not that bad

947
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,527
He is a very conditional idea about colonialism

948
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,903
Not seem to have a principled idea against regime change

949
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
Against nation-building.

950
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
I think he has

951
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
It's not

952
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
Is conditional it's about whether or not the people who are going

953
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
And taking over other countries

954
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,543
Leave him alone or not right

955
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
If you

956
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,359
Just didn't take away his gun

957
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,479
Yeah I know he's against regime-change except fairy in the right conditions

958
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,063
Just like he's against the capitol 6 riot

959
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,135
Because it wasn't the right time I wasn't the right

960
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,023
Preparation here that to me is really a real glaring hole

961
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
I can't

962
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
I mean I guess

963
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,399
A lot of the times people who'd be listening to this may be back in

964
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,495
2003's listening to it on the radio wouldn't be listening to it as critically

965
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
That's early as I'm listening to it now

966
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
That seems like something with it

967
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
Should be a real problem for him and his listeners

968
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
The idea of the key would be

969
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
Be okay with a war emperor

970
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:53,183
The same way that George Washington would have now obviously abolishing the Constitution

971
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
That would be a

972
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Discussion

973
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Like

974
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:00,095
All of his intros are like you want to end your knee will so does he

975
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,191
This you understand that this is exactly the way that you know

976
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,567
Rationalize Alexa

977
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
I guess Reese

978
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
1:10

979
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
When Trump was empowered wanted to

980
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,295
Colonize space

981
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
I know right

982
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
Man I heard that s*** so much

983
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,487
Do those people who call in and they're like what do we get out of this war

984
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
Do they not understand how Psychopathic that sounds like

985
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
Hey what do I look

986
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
I'm sure it's

987
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:40,287
What's my bottom line

988
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,687
That's gross

989
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:50,271
Let's imagine like a president that we were

990
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Supportive of

991
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Just coming out of being like

992
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
I think I'm going to buy Greenland

993
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,559
With all of the other policies I'm going along

994
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,911
You know what this is a good idea how galatea cannabis

995
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Here's what

996
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,799
Carter is second about right the gas crisis is going on and he's like a

997
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
You know where there's gas

998
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,175
Me neither but let's buy Greenland I'm going to take next week

999
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
It's ours

1000
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,599
Which is sort of a scene so far

1001
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
In a 2000

1002
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
3

1003
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,439
And here we come

1004
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,983
Lawrence

1005
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,111
There's a few things that really concerned me

1006
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,903
About this intro that Alex's reading

1007
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Dennis Cuddy

1008
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:05,535
This is the exact wording that you'll find for him on pretty much all other websites

1009
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Just don't sound right

1010
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,935
When someone isn't been employed as an actual Professor their bio probably wouldn't say that they've quotes

1011
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
Taught at the University level

1012
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,519
Would almost always specified

1013
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
School where they were a professor

1014
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
Relevant

1015
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
It's the University of black

1016
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,039
Honestly I've given a few lectures at colleges so I guess I could technically claim that I've taught at the University level that it didn't mean any

1017
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
You could get on info

1018
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:36,767
The second issue that I have of his bio is that he specifies a major and a minor in terms of his PhD which is a little bit

1019
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Bizarre

1020
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
Typically that's the language that people use to

1021
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
Just got their undergraduate education where is if you reach the graduate level

1022
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Doctoral program

1023
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
You be unlikely to have a minor

1024
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,335
You probably discuss your area of emphasis and as a way of discussing

1025
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
You know your credentials mr. seems really really weird

1026
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
It sounds like what you would describe if you

1027
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Didn't get a pH

1028
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,831
HD I was worried about that

1029
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Yeah or if

1030
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,695
You purchased one from somewhere outside of the United States

1031
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
Well I was concerned

1032
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:11,839
But I was able to find his dissertation was we published in a 1978 issue

1033
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,399
Of the Journal of American History titled quote

1034
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,471
American Immigration to Australia 1945

1035
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
To the present

1036
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
So it does appear that

1037
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
He did complete a PhD program

1038
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
But I'm not sure what this area of study has to

1039
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
To do with qualifying him to be an expert in the New World Order

1040
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
If you check out his bibliography

1041
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,575
Books about the New World Order been not so many books about Australian immigration

1042
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,927
Still active as a conspiracy weirdo to this day

1043
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Beers that he's been pretty

1044
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
Pro Trump which raises an interesting question about why he's not

1045
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Still a figure

1046
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Went out to show I thought maybe they'd

1047
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Didn't hit it off

1048
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
But they get along pretty well

1049
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:50,495
Interesting yeah I don't know I don't know what happened but he's that I recognized

1050
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
For many of the press

1051
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Send a text

1052
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Sunset

1053
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,895
It's always covered baby just got out of the game

1054
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
No you still in the game

1055
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,295
Maybe he got out of Alex and maybe you got out of the Heat

1056
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
I believe

1057
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
Anyway this guy's got an interesting shredded

1058
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Convince

1059
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
People like I know you can't

1060
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
Discriminate like a universe

1061
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
The PHD program

1062
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,119
Can't discriminate based on religious beliefs or ideology

1063
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
Could you be like sneakily like

1064
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,311
Hey what if you wanted to go on Infowars would you go on Infowars and if the answer is yes they like

1065
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,687
To be fair it was 76 when he got his Ph.D

1066
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
Infowars did not exist

1067
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
2 years old

1068
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,367
We can't do it look you can't litigate ex post facto

1069
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
I've heard that from Subway

1070
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,767
So I look we want to give you this degree but there's a two-year-old over in Dallas

1071
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,559
Do something weird

1072
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,679
Look if the devil has been aware of Alex Jones from the beginning

1073
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,983
I don't know anyway

1074
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
Dennis's got this interests

1075
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
Sing trick that he uses

1076
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
Because he wants to like

1077
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
Cut through the b*******

1078
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Like if

1079
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,175
People people don't don't agree with him right

1080
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Cuts through the b*******

1081
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Is it sneak

1082
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
New World Order

1083
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
The first thing

1084
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,023
Therapy disposition

1085
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
To think you're a nut if you talk

1086
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
About conspiracy theories

1087
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,007
Suppose I told you there was a power

1088
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Somewhere so complete

1089
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,079
So pervasive someone Owasso watch Road

1090
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Speak above your breast

1091
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
He said that

1092
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:47,487
First of all I can't imagine how little I care about having a Woodrow Wilson quotes snuck up on me

1093
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
Yeah I think I would be like

1094
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,471
Secondly and more importantly what this guy's doing is misusing the quote from Wilson's platform 1913

1095
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
The full quote

1096
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
He's going from his quote

1097
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,871
Since I entered politics I've chiefly had men's views confided to me private

1098
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,735
Some of the biggest man in the United States in the field of Commerce and manufacturer are afraid of somebody

1099
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
They are afraid of something

1100
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,159
They know that there's a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlock so complete so pervasive

1101
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,207
That they had better not speak above their breath

1102
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,743
When they speak in condemnation of

1103
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:25,119
If you continue reading it super clear that Wilson's talking about isn't the spooky cabal of globalist

1104
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,215
But be completely unregulated nature of industry and how people

1105
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,775
We've already amassed a certain amount of power can use that

1106
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
Stop at people who are just getting

1107
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Start it right

1108
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,615
Come a little later in the text

1109
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,271
And this is the country which is lifted to the admiration of the world its ideals of absolutely free opportunity

1110
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,879
Where no man is supposed to be under any limitation accept the limitations of his character and his mine

1111
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,999
Where they're supposed to be no distinction of class no distinction of blood no distinction of social status

1112
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
But where men win or lose by their merits

1113
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
I live very close to my own conscience as a public man whether we can any longer stand at our doors and welcome any new

1114
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Cumbers upon these term

1115
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,335
American industry is not free as once it was free

1116
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
American Enterprise is not free

1117
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,455
With only a little capital is finding it harder

1118
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,783
To get into the field more and more impossible to compete with the big

1119
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Why

1120
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,159
Because the laws of this country did not prevent the strong from crushing the week

1121
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:25,279
Antitrust issues were really big topical politics in the 1910s and that's with

1122
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
Yeah that's why I was

1123
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Plank and Wilson

1124
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Agenda

1125
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,423
You clearly in favor of taking power away from monopolies and giving a better chance

1126
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Smaller upper up-and-coming businesses

1127
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
And that's what this passage

1128
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,031
From his platform is all about

1129
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
If you just take a look at the section the Cutty is reading out of context

1130
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,271
It could sound like they were saying there was a group of villains running the world or whatever but if you take it within its proper context you read something

1131
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Very different

1132
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
He doesn't favor regulate

1133
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,951
Boy you know a guy who says that

1134
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
Who also

1135
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Made

1136
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
The black

1137
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Servants

1138
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,607
In the White House

1139
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
Hide

1140
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
Whenever he walk

1141
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
How to buy

1142
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
He didn't

1143
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
Steve mikula

1144
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,567
Maybe if you say that

1145
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
And do that

1146
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:17,247
If you got to go back in time and kill this guy I'm not I'm not I'm not here to litigate Woodrow Wilson's career

1147
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,087
Totally I just hear it in my head

1148
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
And know that if

1149
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:28,511
At the same time without losing my mind because that reaction is difficult to hat

1150
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,095
Playing using a quote

1151
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
I don't know if I can

1152
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
Except that he doesn't understand that

1153
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
I find that difficult

1154
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
2

1155
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
The cut

1156
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
Yeah

1157
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
I find it difficult to believe

1158
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,991
That he would be able to read that quote read further in the text

1159
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
And not understand

1160
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
What this is about

1161
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
Now if possible

1162
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,439
And it's also possible that the depth of his research doesn't include

1163
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,535
Other paragraphs after maybe he's just seeing this

1164
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
In some other texts in the same way that everybody

1165
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
In the right-wing is nozzle

1166
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
Exact they've only read stuff from like skousen talking

1167
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,079
Sing about tragedy

1168
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
Did that this quote and it sounds really good and sweet

1169
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Freak normies out

1170
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Check this out

1171
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,015
But I don't know I find I find it to be a problem

1172
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,551
For me to take him seriously

1173
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
Any white date there talkin

1174
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Alex

1175
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,975
Bacardi and one of the things I like Aziz doctor Cudi and that's Lisa Edelstein character on house

1176
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Oh okay

1177
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
Alright

1178
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:43,775
So they're talkin and they get to conversation about Bohemian Grove

1179
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,591
More details about how

1180
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,407
On heroic is breaking in Hawaii

1181
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
Whataburger

1182
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,247
Are you aware that the Bohemian Grove

1183
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
The video where a guy

1184
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Okay

1185
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,727
That certainly fits with the holocron

1186
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Something you were just allowed to walk in

1187
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,847
The story seems a little more dashing

1188
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Is it now

1189
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Little more humble

1190
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,479
Back at this point interesting

1191
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
So this

1192
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
My town for this clip cuz this pissed

1193
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
Me

1194
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,207
So Alex is talking about Bohemian Grove any wants to bring up the satanic element

1195
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,279
You want to talk about their dude

1196
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:42,143
And I'm like hey this is one of the big things I'm interested in 2003 are you fighting the devil

1197
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
We got to know this

1198
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Text me off

1199
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,519
Element

1200
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
People running around

1201
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
Weird Behavior

1202
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Holder

1203
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,831
I'm guessing they were just drunk and they like peed on a bush

1204
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
Yeah that sounds

1205
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:41,279
Urination ritual of many a Cubs game

1206
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,679
Before and thought I got to get this weird urination ritual done real quick yeah I've been to bonfire party

1207
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,495
They were just full of weird urination rituals

1208
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,639
Hey Google a word

1209
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,687
The reason I'm pissed off babe

1210
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
Question

1211
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,039
Sidetracked by talking about Peter

1212
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
God dammit

1213
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
I wanted to know about the satanic element

1214
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,975
It doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal

1215
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,071
If you're just going to get distracted with urination red certainly not important enough

1216
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,375
Come back to us immediately

1217
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,423
So this guy Cudi

1218
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
Prediction

1219
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Yeah

1220
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,543
Thanks

1221
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
This site aches

1222
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,639
Did not age well

1223
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
Situation

1224
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
What I tried

1225
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
War

1226
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Will happen

1227
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,095
Or it'll be over

1228
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,399
Star with relatively few casualties

1229
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,799
Took the stage War

1230
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
Hoover quick

1231
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
You know that's

1232
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
Really comforting

1233
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,223
Cuz I was worried that it was going to blow up into a thing that d

1234
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Destabilizing

1235
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
The entire world

1236
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,319
Yeah this this is bad sinking

1237
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,719
Other possibilities

1238
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,999
Everything that's happened

1239
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,559
Would have happened differently if it was a real

1240
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
This is just

1241
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Terrible

1242
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
Wow

1243
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,727
To learn the past

1244
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,799
About Australian immigration

1245
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,079
Are doomed to repeat that

1246
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Extra other

1247
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
So that one of Alex's big

1248
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Reason

1249
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Seems to believe that 911

1250
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,295
Was an inside job is they were running

1251
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,319
Drill

1252
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,903
Yeah yeah yeah drills are very important to Inside Job

1253
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,487
Man that made me laugh really hard

1254
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Because

1255
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,351
Cuddy accidentally punctured a giant hole in that theory

1256
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
By trying to help

1257
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,439
That morning is that very time

1258
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
2

1259
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,255
Pause

1260
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,583
That causes great

1261
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,655
Is staring daggers

1262
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,727
What is the man who just got

1263
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,031
Slice to shreds with a glance

1264
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,359
It's so important for us

1265
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,407
The theories surrounding the

1266
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
The drills

1267
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
That they're not

1268
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
Be drills regularly or similar grills that happened in the past

1269
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
Picked up on it there

1270
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:55,583
I'm so helpful because

1271
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
I do think that

1272
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
As much as

1273
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,935
Another still a bunch of dumb dumbs

1274
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Back then

1275
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,775
They're people who are less on the same identical script

1276
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:07,359
Yeah like when you listen to these present episodes it'll be like Alex interviewing is

1277
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Is Bucking lawyers

1278
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,199
We're doing yes and the games with him

1279
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,247
Basically just not only that but

1280
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,551
Alex Wright

1281
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Not like

1282
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,111
Puncture anything

1283
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,903
You're not saying anything that could be like well

1284
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
That's a reason why this doesn't

1285
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
Makes sense

1286
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,999
In this moment that guy is

1287
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
Just thought that added to the

1288
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
Attracted actually

1289
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
GloZell

1290
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
To shred

1291
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:29,887
Makes it look bad

1292
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:33,983
He was like a retriever bringing you the paper after stepping in a

1293
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,799
Pile of s***

1294
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
I'm so good

1295
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,639
I brought you the papers I like you

1296
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
So earlier Jordan we learned

1297
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,503
The Dennis Miller

1298
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,783
Is a big-time social

1299
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
Lifetime play

1300
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
The game show that is taking

1301
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Country by storm

1302
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Who

1303
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,999
An Ultra,

1304
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,119
Every episode dammit

1305
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,519
Bastard I don't know it could be anybody every episode so far in 2003 I think we've had Alex out to somebody

1306
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:14,687
Add syrup

1307
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Interesting

1308
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
Starting out a little earlier with a

1309
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:32,351
Ultra calming

1310
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
Alright

1311
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Michael Savage

1312
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,471
Bill kristol

1313
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,031
That is what happened baby

1314
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
That is what happened

1315
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
When you

1316
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
Don't find Curly's gold

1317
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Alright

1318
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,663
You become adults

1319
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:50,271
Call me because it's clear that the ruling class has taken the gold before you got there

1320
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
Wrong bill kristol

1321
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Earlier

1322
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,231
We got distracted by

1323
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,815
Urination ritual when Alex was about to talk about

1324
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,095
Satanic Elementary

1325
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
This is like a prank

1326
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
On me

1327
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
I swear to God

1328
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,503
America

1329
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
Okay

1330
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,215
Mike

1331
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,615
Went off in the middle of him saying Satan literally I know it is it is a little bit of a

1332
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Cheez-Its

1333
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:53,247
It's like this isn't admissible he could have said everything he could have said everything

1334
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,551
Literally

1335
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,111
Literally and you know what that means

1336
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,463
I can't wait.

1337
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
Then you're a witch

1338
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
It is you're a witch

1339
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:24,223
Becoming troubling today the level of these

1340
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
It is dangerous

1341
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:31,903
Yeah but it is also pretty funny but it might just went off and it's got this like what's going on

1342
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
We needed

1343
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,095
To hear it's the one word expound on it more you know

1344
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Michael Ross

1345
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,191
Are we go anyway this is a catastrophic problem disease

1346
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
Economics

1347
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Finger job

1348
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,543
That you're willing to

1349
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
Just because more

1350
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
To use them.

1351
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Old fashioned

1352
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
Patriots

1353
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Hoo-boy

1354
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,959
Yeah that's not good

1355
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Yeah it is

1356
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,287
I mean it's just screw up my can

1357
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
Conspiracy theory to know the

1358
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,383
That this kind of thing happens every year at that dust

1359
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Bother

1360
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
It makes me worry

1361
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,551
I don't know I can't be I can't imagine

1362
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,135
Well he is 2300 bad Tech back then

1363
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,999
I kind of understand videos bad take back then

1364
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
Sure

1365
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
What are things that I think of

1366
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Cool

1367
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
About 2003

1368
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Big problem

1369
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,935
On the radio your mics

1370
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,751
To go completely out your guest is left

1371
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
2 trillion

1372
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
Tread water on his own

1373
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,103
How many got to go out to break

1374
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
Alex deals with it Grace

1375
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,567
There's no like

1376
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,663
The globalists are trying to take us off here cuz we're too dangerous there's no

1377
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:34,271
F****** freaking out and leave and he's laughing you know that guy got a tech problem

1378
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
Normal

1379
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:39,135
Person responding to difficulties that would be expect

1380
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
That's true

1381
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
That is true

1382
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,511
Now admittedly I will say that

1383
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,047
There is that would give me

1384
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
Certain justification

1385
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Super allergic reaction

1386
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
If

1387
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,727
I say I'm having later problems after spending

1388
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
60

1389
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,055
Billion dollars on a studio you know like

1390
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:01,407
If you're still having those problems you should be angrier than if you have

1391
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
City Tech

1392
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
Yeah it does make sense

1393
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,087
Yeah cuz then you really can't blame it all on the

1394
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:14,463
No but it is on you it is definitely on you cuz you have not solved the problem

1395
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
Outburst in the present day

1396
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
It still is

1397
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
It should be directed in words

1398
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,119
Supposed to be screaming at the

1399
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,911
The the audience

1400
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,471
I just prefer to see this

1401
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Dislike

1402
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,591
It did it's not like a child lashing out

1403
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,151
It's

1404
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,479
You're the huge problem that happens on your show and you're able to laugh

1405
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,503
And come back brakes

1406
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,087
Good on him being able to take us out to breaking

1407
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
Handle it no I know sometimes

1408
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,463
Genesis feed goes down

1409
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
Sure

1410
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
And everybody likes

1411
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,095
The VH1 part of Behind the Music where there are the

1412
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,703
They're on their meteoric rise but they're just beginning and they're playing their show at the

1413
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
Dunbar down the

1414
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,287
Street and little bit everybody know what he

1415
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
He was going to do so

1416
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
Yeah this is fun

1417
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
So Alec

1418
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,919
Gets to talkin amor

1419
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,271
About the democratization in Iraq and the government

1420
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
She's coming in

1421
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
We do from hist

1422
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
Again

1423
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
Very shortly after this episode

1424
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Dbats

1425
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Vacation

1426
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Good idea

1427
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,535
Nickelback

1428
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,479
Wrong is wrong wrong about that

1429
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Quite wrong

1430
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
It's just interesting that these

1431
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,927
Consistently going down this road and it does setup and weird

1432
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,719
I don't know what's going to happen as

1433
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
You know like

1434
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
Maid comes to an end and I continued

1435
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
He was like how is he going to

1436
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,607
Navigate that territory

1437
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
It is ironic

1438
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
Even that

1439
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
It is almost his

1440
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Exact opinion of the bath

1441
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
That

1442
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
Was echoed in American

1443
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
Policy

1444
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
Well he's

1445
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,895
Criticizing them

1446
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
India

1447
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
India that they would

1448
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Do they opted

1449
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Opposite of what

1450
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
Facebook

1451
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,111
Yeah it is because the way he's presenting things

1452
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
He doesn't really have

1453
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Good leg

1454
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
Get to stand on

1455
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
Opposed

1456
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,511
2B pacification

1457
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:29,887
He has to be in favor of it run to comes along exactly willing to be

1458
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
Strongly in favor

1459
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
Certainly

1460
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,079
No as things go along I don't think it will own the consequences it didn't it didn't go well

1461
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,103
No

1462
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
So

1463
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,687
I would say that listening to this episode

1464
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,711
There is

1465
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Very little

1466
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
In terms of news stories

1467
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:52,159
There is a little bit of like a couple of headlines grown out here and there

1468
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,463
He talked a lot about Richard Pearl hui-k'o

1469
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
The Prince of Darkness

1470
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Sure

1471
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
I think this

1472
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,911
He's obsessed with that dude cuz I've heard him talk about that dude in the present day

1473
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,703
Constantly

1474
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
When you get too drunk on WIC

1475
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,311
Rogan show and stuff he'll talk about the darkness

1476
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,919
He would go around to go around at parties and tell women that are like he kills people

1477
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,991
You think that if I could get him aroused and

1478
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
And stuff

1479
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,063
He brings up this dude

1480
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
A lot

1481
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Alright

1482
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Anyway

1483
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,439
There's not a whole lot I do like a lifelong Grudge

1484
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:31,839
That's your admirable

1485
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,679
Realizes

1486
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,551
God that was uninspired

1487
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:28,671
That was boring

1488
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,535
Go on guy before he started doing his Churchill impression

1489
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
We got to

1490
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
Get up

1491
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,311
Yes I want to join Alex comes to the end of the show and realizes that he didn't cover most of the news as opposed to it happening

1492
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
An hour before the show ends

1493
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
And then. Still no more news of govern

1494
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
You got a minute

1495
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,527
He wants to really hit on is

1496
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
They're people reaffirming

1497
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,391
The Bill of Rights which is very meaningful and important

1498
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:05,279
This is just the same thing as in 2009 all the Tenth Amendment resolutions

1499
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,375
Yes okay we have to have the state house has passed these things

1500
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,935
They say the same thing as the Constitution

1501
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
I don't know babe

1502
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
What up

1503
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,615
To what extent

1504
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,431
Do we do they describe God given rights

1505
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
You know what like

1506
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,551
There is River give me a biblical

1507
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,855
Explanation of what rights

1508
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:35,743
God specifically gives us don't recall him writing the goddamn Bill of Rights

1509
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
I don't know if it

1510
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
It's derived

1511
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,839
Directly from anything in the Bible but this is

1512
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,375
This is a pretty standard

1513
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,679
Element of anti-communism

1514
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,263
They they have this idea that

1515
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
Communism seeks to

1516
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,615
Tile or religion and get rid of religion

1517
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
And in doing so you get rid of God

1518
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
Write if you get rid of God

1519
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Then there's no more Justice

1520
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
Application for why people have right

1521
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,927
By the Creator you have no rights

1522
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
Sure communism

1523
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
Gets rid of God which

1524
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
Gets rid of right switch

1525
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
Makes you all

1526
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,679
The important hinges for the god-given right

1527
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,495
I just feel like

1528
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
If you want to win the mark

1529
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
Marketplace of ideas you should

1530
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,847
Kind of write down what rights

1531
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Your pad

1532
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,991
What they did and we'll compare them to the other thing it's in the Declaration of Independence Constitution

1533
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:29,759
It's those right

1534
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
Those are

1535
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,135
Constitution god-given rights that are protected

1536
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,415
By the count

1537
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Constitute

1538
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
Even dumber than I thought it was

1539
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,047
Sort of

1540
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,143
I don't know what's an argument that you can run into a lot

1541
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
The

1542
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:50,751
The notion of like does all morality stem

1543
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,335
From religion

1544
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
Obviously

1545
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:03,295
Thousand years to think that no morality and ethics are impossible outside of religious framework

1546
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,879
I don't know I don't I don't buy into that but

1547
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,743
Kind of a colonel at the base of their ideas

1548
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
A lot of his associates contraction of right

1549
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,839
I just didn't I didn't

1550
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
Quite understand what they were talking

1551
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,239
Sing about because it generally speaking whenever people don't like talking about God

1552
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
I appreciate it if they have some sort of biblical basis for it

1553
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,127
It just sounds like it's just guns

1554
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,175
Man people love the

1555
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,711
Their guns it was

1556
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,503
The eleventh commandment

1557
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
It's just there

1558
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
Fan comes on

1559
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,207
Commandant was guns

1560
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,999
Baby

1561
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
And the Let Jesus said

1562
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,375
The last ever one of you will betray babe

1563
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
Before the cock

1564
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,823
Exploration of back in the 18 years

1565
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,127
Ago today 18 years ago

1566
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
Today what an idiot

1567
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
It's very nice

1568
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Is it go sucks

1569
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,063
Wrong ideas about what was going to happen

1570
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Such

1571
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,367
Misguided nonsense

1572
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Not good

1573
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,695
A weirdo presented as an expert

1574
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
Pretty normal

1575
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,559
More evidence than Alex should sue Joe Rogan

1576
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
A using the word powerful I think it's

1577
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
I don't know

1578
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
I mean I think

1579
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:30,591
It'd be tough though to win a lawsuit whenever you've got that oh Alex just said we're going to play that

1580
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,407
That clip of Alex saying he's going to gut him like a pig and I like

1581
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,991
How are you going to win that kind of lost free-speech man I that's fair

1582
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
Infuriated

1583
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Bye

1584
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855

Is it going to urination talk after Mike's cutting out right around when Satan was coming up

1586
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
Personally

1587
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:59,007
Very funny but I'm excited to see if the next couple episodes I have anything that will help clarify position

1588
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
I'd be more funny if somebody actually

1589
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
Cut off the mic

1590
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,383
Whatever you're the best they literally like

1591
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:10,783
We can't have that out there boom Redbox

1592

Holding
