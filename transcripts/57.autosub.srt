1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra First Time coloring with huge fan I love your work

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,848
We're couple of dudes you like to sit around and talk a little bit

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,640
Emerick Jones

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
And today you have brought

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Filbert's

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
Old time

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Quality lime

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
The rhyming aspect

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,928
Perfection part of why this is my choice

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
It's a clear bottle of nothing but

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
Green neon green

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
Yeah

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,496
Here's the thing the other day

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,872
I woke up in a cold sweat at about 3 in the morning the other day

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
The one thought that wow is that bad

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:57,088
The worst thing I've ever tasted really invalidates the middle of

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
I've not tasted this but I realize like

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
Lime is a great flavor

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,512
I was laying awake in bed like

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
Man lime underutilized

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Let me see if I agree with you

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Do you think it's under

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
That's not bad

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
You're still wrong

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
A lot stronger

27
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
Based on your response

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
We have some strong opinions about

29
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
And we will get to them here in a moment but first

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
The show with

31
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
Contacts drop from Alex Jones

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
TV show

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
So bad

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,568
That's so coarse as a reference to Ted Nugent song

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Hell yeah

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
That's just a nice example of hat like what we're missing out on

37
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
His back his his singing in and out of brakes

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Astounding

39
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,600
This one was in the middle of the show so they kept it in

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,464
Jordan

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh my investigation

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
What happened to Alex Jones

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
In 2015 to get him on board

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
Wrecks today

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,776
There will also be incredibly f***** up

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Stuff to happen

47
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Yeah before we get to all that

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
Give a shout out to a new donator

49
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
We got another person to donate

50
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
So I

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
And like to give a shout out to you number one

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Rated podcast

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Amongst

54
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,024
Yep

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Thank you very much

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,912
You speculated that it may be Chase Bank I wanted to

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
You spell any of these rumors

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,568
Do we have taken up sponsorship with the globalist controlled Bank

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
Alex

60
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:03,296
He hears about a good love people who need to donate to the show obviously

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,976
Obviously it's donations

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
Call Alex in my head

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,704
Jordan will be going over the time span of August 12th to August 16th

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
In 2015

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Pink eye

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
It's a wide range

67
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
. there's a whole lot of stuff that goes on

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Others

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Really no good way for me to distill

70
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Symphysis

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Of the events that we are about to

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
I will I will say

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
That we start

74
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Lucy

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Trends that alarm me a little bit

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
And this first clip is is part and parcel

77
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
There is a mark

78
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Rise in

79
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Tamagotchi

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
All these people want to turn off their Tamagotchis

81
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
Global

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Is a divide-and-conquer strategy

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Starting

84
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
You say a lot of positive things about repressive regime

85
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
No that's good there is a bit of really trope

86
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
Sentiment

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
To come through

88
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
And also this first clip

89
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
What

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
To complain about Jeb Bush

91
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
I am doing so

92
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
White washes

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
And completely tweaks

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,687
The history of the Syrian Civil War into a very pro-assad

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,271
Newpointe

96
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,183
But here it is

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
45 years until 3000 of them

98
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Military

99
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,215
With Russian backing has been really fighting

100
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
No

101
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
And now the answer is to bomb

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,759
So he is essentially what he does end up saying about Putin and a later date

103
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
What about all those people that have gas

104
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
What about all this

105
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
Fake news

106
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
For speaking out against

107
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,167
What about invent murdered after

108
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Okay

109
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
What about what about it

110
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
His car is he has a lot of

111
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
That's not fake news

112
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
You got a Hellcat

113
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,991
Americana the whole thing in

114
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Syria is

115
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Such as

116
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
F***** up

117
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Future Revolution revelation of

118
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Climate change

119
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
That's what

120
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
That's why I

121
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
People are like all of them

122
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
100 years

123
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Ignore the fact

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
People are going to move

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Mean s*** is going to happen

126
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Just look at how rough

127
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
These work Netflix

128
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Syrian children are

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Just Meats

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Somewhere to go somewhere

131
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Tubi

132
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
Survived by their own government

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
You

134
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Child

135
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,559
Terrorist you girl you very small

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,703
You are a dumb libtard cock it's not actually a small girl it's an adult

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Passport that says he's a little girl

138
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Okay

139
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
If we're willing to entertain that possibility

140
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Counterparts

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Two very small searing

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
You know you got to blend in

143
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,631
Yeah if your kid no one like at the country you're going to his refugees going to give you any credibility

144
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,263
You know you got to get nut wrench code on your friend shoulders and put on a fake beard

145
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
Play calyxes

146
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
Misinterpretation of what is happening in Syria

147
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Abacus

148
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
15 is

149
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Is calamitous

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
888

151
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
It's a literal Jen

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
And he's super willing to side with Assad

153
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
Like side with

154
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
The side because they love money

155
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Alex

156
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Because he's not getting

157
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
People

158
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
That's kind of where he's at probably right

159
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
Documented it pretty serious trend of trump

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Seeming to really admired

161
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Dictators and hating

162
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
A Cooperative bodies

163
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
That's kind of

164
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Is very similar with Ally

165
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
It seems like you

166
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Yes respect

167
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
For men

168
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
In the people who are like strong men

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Like I mean he's talked about like

170
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,519
In the Philippines

171
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
Declared open season on his soldiers raping women in hostile territory

172
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Say what you want he gets it done right so I mean he has

173
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
Friends but you obviously

174
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
And I think the

175
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,719
I'm not going to say that that doesn't play a small part in why he ends up eventually liking Trump

176
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
We're starting to

177
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
Be more of it in this August

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
So

179
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,215
Gross misunderstanding

180
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
All of the people who are fighting again

181
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Asad Ric

182
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
And the al-Qaeda is the same thing as

183
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
That's crazy

184
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Because Al-Qaeda

185
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
With the Syrian rebels

186
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Who are also fighting

187
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
The Syrian

188
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
The people who are screwed the most

189
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
In Syria are

190
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Please stop

191
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Killing us

192
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Yeah

193
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Those are the people who got f***** over

194
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,983
And because of xenophobia and because of unwillingness to wrestle with the

195
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
The nuances

196
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Susan complexities of it

197
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
We

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
Seem to have a position that Dean's Alvez

199
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Screwed

200
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
You're probably a bad

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Yeah

202
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
That's really bad

203
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Propaganda on

204
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Play the part of

205
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Opera

206
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
The narrative

207
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
That

208
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Equal

209
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
There's no

210
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Like the Syrian rebels

211
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Didn't want

212
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Or don't want some

213
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
I'm kind of

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Modern

215
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
Civilization the one that they were

216
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Not just not getting but they were

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Starving to

218
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
And all they tried to do

219
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Do is modernize this

220
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
And become a

221
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Free

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Free her Society

223
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
One that does

224
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,999
So we should be on their side right America story

225
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
F***

226
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Our bloodline

227
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
The third man

228
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Finlay cassatt's been in power for

229
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,287
Pretty long time and his dad was in power before it's not like

230
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Good

231
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Hey we're going to do 70

232
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
76

233
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
2.0

234
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Here's what we do

235
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Okay we go all-in on

236
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
No More Kings

237
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
We're not declaring

238
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Declaring independence

239
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
For us

240
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
We're declaring in the

241
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
Independence for the world service

242
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
Another globalist Bankers behind the scenes

243
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
I'm fine with that

244
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
Let's just go get rid of them but if you kill the king of the global is Bankers will just install new people who will be a problem

245
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
The problem not the King Park

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
I don't know

247
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,447
And we've already spun backwards into

248
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
So this next clip

249
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Alex Jones shows

250
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
And his

251
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Is Providence

252
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Is discernment sharp as ever

253
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
He's back on his

254
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Everything online

255
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
And he's into the collapse

256
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Narrative that goes through the next couple days

257
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
This said is predictions pretty specific

258
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
12 signs and eminent Global Financial crash

259
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
Michaels.com

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,055
Did you see what just happened

261
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
This caused

262
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Other Global currencies

263
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,623
World of the US dollar the price of oil

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
The Dow fell 212

265
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
On Tuesday.

266
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Appointment

267
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,911
As we hurtled towards the absolutely critical month of September

268
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
And October

269
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
Organized hoarder

270
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Christmas Christmas

271
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Naked Joker

272
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
The police are heads of their bunkers right now

273
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
But we shouldn't fear monger

274
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
Do really well with the global crisis Alex

275
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
I wish I wasn't right

276
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
Congratulations you're not right in October

277
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
2050

278
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
A+

279
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Fakeness

280
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
Adidas

281
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Globalist would be

282
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
Concerned with still having a Christmas

283
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
What if

284
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,335
Are there other famous they want 95% of the world population

285
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
But everybody

286
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
Tell you that the globalist have a warrant

287
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Concerned with when they pull the trigger on this globe because they've got to make all the money off of selling breakfast

288
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,791
Narrative

289
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:59,679
Field day on making money more than they make it JCPenney's for Christmas sales

290
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Yeah

291
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Stupid stupid

292
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,871
Weird Alyssa

293
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Send to him

294
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Real numbers

295
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
12.6

296
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Your Alex

297
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
But that's also real numbers as reported

298
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,207
Contextualize by an article on infowars.com

299
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
Massage Envy

300
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
But my point is there they're just

301
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Spice it up a little bit

302
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
The other thing though that I want to punch you

303
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
How to be one Yuan

304
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Child

305
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
Commodity currencies

306
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
This is not

307
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,607
Fiat currency cuz it's resource

308
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
Right back onto the Willy Wonka

309
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Go get on those little

310
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Chocolate coins

311
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Christmas

312
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
It's really f***** up is that like

313
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,391
He really laid out in that last clip one of the games he plays that is really

314
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
If airtight

315
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
It's basically a skits

316
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
The phrenic game

317
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
And that is that like

318
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,399
Everyone's making fun of me now and then when it's not so bad later because we've exposed this thing

319
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:41,055
Because of the work that the Patriots have done getting the word out

320
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
Don't make fun of how I made a big deal out of it

321
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
But

322
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Secret hero of

323
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
Every single time that I complain about something doesn't happen

324
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
It's because we have made it not

325
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Fair game to play

326
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
That is literal insanity

327
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
His audience

328
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Expose this stuff

329
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Game

330
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
There's just

331
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
There's just never any pie

332
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Communication

333
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Alex the

334
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Economy didn't

335
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
You predicted it you're welcome

336
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
That did not occur to me

337
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
So you're saying that the economy didn't collapse because of

338
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
The View

339
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Well

340
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
How about

341
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
The last time it didn't collapse

342
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
It was that you had a flu

343
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
I tried to stop

344
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,271
I was too busy focusing on the globalist other attacks or something like that

345
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Antenna

346
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
It's perfect

347
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
It's fighting anime

348
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,159
I really respected him one level because

349
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
It's clearly super profitable respected in terms of reality

350
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
You'll notice this is

351
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Like our investigation in 2015 is

352
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,727
Specifically about the Trump campaign

353
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
He doesn't really get into much

354
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Trump stopping

355
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
A little bit down the line

356
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,223
But if you have not listened to last episode

357
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Get you up to speed

358
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
He thinks

359
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Trump is a predator and a weasel

360
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
But he works

361
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Casinos cuz he thinks their predatory

362
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,815
Hugh loves Trump is a vaccination

363
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
And is playing crazy

364
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,239
Because it makes it okay for people who don't support

365
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Paul to say those things public

366
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Is it

367
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
Big fan of Rand now because

368
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
I mean

369
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
He's not saying though

370
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,063
No.

371
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
A friend would say that

372
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,927
It really feels like if I can be

373
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
A little bit dramatic

374
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
It feels like it's a relationship that he has with Rand Paul

375
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
That's been going on for a long time

376
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,983
And then a new hot kid comes into school you know what new Joey Alpha dude

377
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
Shows up

378
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Grandpa

379
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,151
You guys had a good thing going you philosophically matched up on a lot of stuff

380
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
But this guy who just showed up

381
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,319
I am loving this analogy hijinks are getting you f****** wet

382
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
Spitballs and what-have-yous calling

383
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
Calling people racist names

384
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Feel like oh my God this guy is

385
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
He is a rebel

386
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
So you're just your p**** just gets going

387
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,495
You just want it ever say that word like that ever again soda

388
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,871
Grossest thing I've ever heard in my entire life and then

389
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
You feel yourself

390
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Pulled away from Ron Paul

391
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
But at the same time you know you loved him for that shared history and shared philosophy but you wish you would be more like this bully

392
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Any wallpaper

393
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Because that's not him

394
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
I think that's where Alex is in August the 20th

395
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
In a breakup

396
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Relationship

397
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Force the person

398
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
So you got

399
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
You're going to have to f*** the Reb

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
In some ways

401
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
This stretch of time that we've been in

402
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Uno

403
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Trump announces candidacy on was a June 16th

404
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
The 2015

405
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
And now here we are on August

406
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
August 12th is left

407
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Two months of kind of been a holding pattern

408
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
A little bit of like

409
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
You know you're going to

410
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,439
It's kind of weird

411
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
It's super weird 22c

412
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Am I beautiful

413
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,167
Really good really good

414
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Is very good

415
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Gross

416
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
This is an adult show

417
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Not a family show

418
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Like I've climbed up ass

419
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Is really weird

420
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Rallying the troops

421
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,111
Letting you know the war is going on whether you know it or not

422
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
Right

423
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
With

424
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
School

425
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Right wing

426
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Mirror why

427
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
Father will deal with on the other side

428
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
I wish I wasn't

429
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
We don't mix

430
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Cottonwood

431
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,871
And the wood lights on fire never been sued for libel or slander

432
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,855
So you can sue our source if you want another publication

433
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
We're just going off

434
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
25% what we cover is open source intelligence

435
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Analysis of where I think it's going

436
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,831
And the Patriots worldwide

437
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Operating

438
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
We've been trying to stop all this

439
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
Old Forge

440
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Do you claim with fireballs

441
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:13,504
I've looked a bit of looking into Margaret Sanger because Alex is really mad at her

442
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
You gave women rights

443
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,904
The reality is

444
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
Racism

445
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
Stuff all of that is super out of

446
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Context

447
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,424
Popular, let me see if I can pull up

448
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,240
This quote here exactly

449
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
You know who started Planned Parenthood

450
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
She was

451
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah well

452
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Started Planned Parenthood in black neighborhoods

453
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
In order to

454
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Get rid of blacks

455
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
That's one of the big claims with

456
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,208
People make the reality is that the first Planned Parent

457
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
The clinic that was opened in 19

458
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
Italian

459
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:03,680
And Irish neighborhood in New York

460
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
Talk about it

461
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
From a letter that she

462
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
She wrote that says

463
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
We don't want word to go out

464
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
That we want to exterminate the negro population

465
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
And the minister is the man who can

466
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Can straighten that out

467
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,832
Straighten out that idea if it ever occurs

468
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Sounds

469
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Terrible know what it sounds like it's her saying

470
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
Oh I know what these people are going to say about

471
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Now you're smart

472
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,632
That was so easy to pick up

473
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
Hey we don't want people

474
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
We'll just save this dumb s***

475
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
This is the guy who's going to get out in

476
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
In front of that.

477
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
And apparently

478
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
You should have gotten a way better

479
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
You take that

480
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,784
Quote from her letter within the context of the letter that is what

481
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,904
He saying if you are someone who is violently anti

482
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,280
You hear the words we don't want word to go out that we want

483
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
Exterminate the negro population

484
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
And what you hear is

485
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
We don't want that s*** to be

486
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Republic

487
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
Of course so which

488
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Again

489
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
You got to be more

490
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Precise in your language

491
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
If you're writing a letter

492
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
To anyone

493
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,736
Most of the time people don't expect publicly

494
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
She

495
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Margaret Sanger

496
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
I don't know if I kept the clip because he yells about Margaret

497
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Hair like

498
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
Within this this stretch of episodes

499
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,096
But one of the things he talks about

500
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,680
She is responsible with Planned Parenthood

501
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,776
Funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and Nazi Germany

502
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,104
All the Nazis are just an offshoot of Planned Parenthood

503
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Oh I that when I

504
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
Have not heard but it's a good one

505
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
I like that that's not true the funding

506
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,368
Funding stuff you can find for like the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute came from

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Like

508
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
The Rockefeller Foundation

509
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
The Kaiser Wilhelm

510
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:08,608
A society the Nazi scientific organization its roots in a Nazi

511
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
See.

512
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
It was founded in 1911

513
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
Exist

514
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Before Planned Parenthood first

515
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Kaiser Wilhelm

516
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,456
National Socialist Party didn't get going until I come with 1920

517
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,552
Give or take a little bit longer after that

518
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Late 20's

519
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
And then

520
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,840
33

521
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
1920

522
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Form into the party

523
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Beat the thing is is that they wasn't

524
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Ended up

525
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Maybe in some

526
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
Some dicey territory later

527
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,832
Want to get into it but they did not have

528
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Some funding scheme

529
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Where in Isaiah

530
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Then I paid

531
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
The Kaiser Wilhelm in

532
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Shoot to kill minorities are in

533
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Anything like that

534
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Is pointing to is that they both

535
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
In the Eugenics movement

536
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
That happened

537
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
Look it's f***** up the word Eugenics is a really f***** up word

538
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,712
Because of racial eugenic

539
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
Of course but the rich as I've already

540
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
The Pasto

541
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
I support it

542
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,648
Because I want to see somebody hit 100 home runs in one season

543
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
Figure this s*** out

544
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Get them all together

545
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Let him fall

546
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
And then we'll go from there

547
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
That's kind of the Olympics

548
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:55,360
The problem with water balloons

549
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200
I don't have time to do a full book report on eugenics

550
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,528
But a lot of it was bad and it wasn't

551
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
There we go

552
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,136
Nazi stuff is the really bad and if you wouldn't

553
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
And Planned Parenthood

554
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
While it had its roots

555
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Install

556
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Eugenics

557
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
It wasn't like

558
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Get rid of black people you done

559
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
No it was

560
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
Be deliberative about our reproduction

561
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
I'm not from a like

562
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
Government or organizations telling you what to do but you take

563
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,384
In control of your own reproductive choice

564
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
Because women were f*****

565
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
Economically because they couldn't chew

566
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Structure

567
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
That's the real reason

568
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
All of the Planned Parenthood

569
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Because they want to make sure that

570
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Women aren't allowed to be

571
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Barefoot and pregnant

572
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
And that's it

573
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
The economic and social power of men

574
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,088
When women are equal and when they have their own

575
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Strongly disagree

576
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
I mean

577
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Text

578
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
It still

579
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Frustrating whenever

580
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Their aim is obvious

581
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
And their lies

582
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Is our

583
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Yam

584
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
But the reason that we have planned parenthood make

585
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Perfect sense

586
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
To everybody

587
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
If you if you have

588
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
No

589
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
If you're coming into it with no bias

590
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Whatsoever

591
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,200
And somebody says okay well

592
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
You know

593
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,296
You should be able to control how many kids you have

594
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
And how many you can

595
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
That way

596
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
None of them starve

597
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah you can take good care of them

598
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
And they can be raised properly to become

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,328
Better people than you work

600
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
You go oh yeah that makes perfect

601
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Beyond

602
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,544
If that's just one angle reproductive take away all the

603
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,664
Screening is an STD STI stuff

604
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,928
Because of those fake videos that were put out by the Center for Medical progress

605
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
Alex is still trick by them

606
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
The detox

607
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
A bunch about how Margaret Sanger was

608
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
She was

609
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Deeply involved with the KKK

610
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
Okay well he's throwing a lot of darts

611
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Around

612
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Study about

613
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
Nazi Kaiser Wilhelm

614
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Text k.k.

615
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
Your pic of one you think you're angry about

616
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
And then you're on board with olive

617
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,160
Margaret Sanger KKK bleeding exactly one time in her life

618
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,024
Alright how did it go this is taken from Margaret Sanger and autobiography

619
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Which she wrote herself

620
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
I would hope

621
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Which was published in 90

622
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
1838 otherwise

623
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
This was excerpted on PolitiFact

624
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
It's a work Advocate birth control

625
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
In her autobiography

626
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Free across the United States

627
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
Exercises are willingness to talk to virtually anyone

628
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Quote from her autobiography

629
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,552
Always to me any aroused group with a good girl

630
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,184
I therefore I accepted an invitation to talk to the women's branch of the Ku Klux Klan

631
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
It's Silver Lake New Jersey

632
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
One of the weirdest experiences I had in Lex

633
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Singers account suggest

634
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
She did not hold the group in the highest esteem

635
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
After Rising

636
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,264
A complicated process that involves driving to a secret location

637
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
It was time for her to speak

638
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Quote

639
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Never before had I looked

640
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
Into a Sea of Faces like this

641
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
I was sure that if I order

642
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
One word such as abortion

643
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Outside the usual vocabulary of these women

644
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
They would go off into Hysteria

645
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
I'm so my address that night had to be in the most Elementary of terms

646
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
As I was trying to make children

647
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Sochi

648
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Do not seem like she has very positive feelings about these

649
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
To the

650
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
The women's

651
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Yeah I'm trying to educate

652
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Hate them

653
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
About

654
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
Two rights in general

655
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Help

656
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Taking care of themselves

657
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
And then those b******

658
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
Stupid and crazy

659
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:27,744
Concise summary of her thought so you can even see within that quote the idea of like women going off in

660
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
Paternalistic idea from the time

661
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
Absolutely not a member of the clan

662
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
And based on the fact that she hired

663
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
Black doctors

664
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
At that time

665
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
Free clinics

666
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
And stuff like that

667
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,224
It really is a strong indication that she was way ahead of the Curve

668
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
In terms of racial understanding

669
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Horseshoe

670
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
And then further

671
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
Personal philosophy

672
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Was

673
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,720
That having access to abortion

674
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
Not even if it wasn't even legal no but having access to birth

675
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,960
Controlling making your own choices with a way of empowering women

676
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
It was a way of giving them control

677
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
I'm so if that is her premise

678
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
The idea of giving that to minority communities

679
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
That's not an attack

680
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
That's the absolute

681
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Yeah

682
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,832
Established clinics in minority neighborhoods

683
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
Means that she is actively trying to help those

684
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Of course that was too long

685
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Why

686
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
I mean I know I know why but

687
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
Why are you doing this

688
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Idiot it's a good thing

689
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
How do you

690
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
It's a good thing

691
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
They know it

692
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
It's a good thing

693
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
And that's why they have to put up this propaganda

694
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
The Republic

695
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Looking f****** new

696
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
That the Affordable Care Act was

697
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Was a good thing

698
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Clearly

699
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
So

700
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Why would you

701
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,232
You constantly spread all these f****** lies about it

702
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
The only reason

703
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,680
Because control

704
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
Try and

705
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,568
Like minorities especially African-Americans

706
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Hispanic

707
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
I have a long history of voting

708
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:28,064
Swing communities as a whole

709
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
Demographic Lee those are

710
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Blocks that liberals

711
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,256
In order to maintain

712
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Any

713
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,632
Representation in government

714
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Among

715
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
These minority communities

716
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
They hate secretly they're trying to kill you right

717
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Secretly they hate you almost

718
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
As much as we

719
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
How much we don't like it they secretly hated

720
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,856
Friends don't actually like you

721
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
That's true of the broker

722
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Coalition

723
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
That the Democrats rely on

724
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Withdraw support

725
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
Make them less likely to vote

726
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,888
Absolutely the whole thing is

727
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Make sure that is few

728
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,824
People of color can vote it's boiled down to minority and Warman

729
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Bruce Owens

730
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
Calculus

731
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,016
They really should

732
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
Has anybody thought about that

733
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
Like let's just have women and people of color

734
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
Just f****** murder all white men

735
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
I bet you guys would

736
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
Well I don't like you I don't like even so

737
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
Suggesting as a joke

738
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
Just because of what's going to end up happen

739
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
Episode I feel like is are we going to commit genocide on this episode

740
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:59,200
You suggesting these things were a dumb dumb to ever to listen to the show and want to attack us

741
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
They would use that as a like these guys advocate

742
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Quote about hate

743
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
Like these people are going to try and smear us don't let them smires as

744
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,840
See it's evidence that there sweetheart there's no winner

745
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
Is that mean that means if you're just coming through everything I've ever said line by line by line

746
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
Something out of context

747
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
That makes me sound like a f******

748
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Dear Lord

749
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Lunatic like

750
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Now it's not Whitwell Jordan

751
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Be careful with your language now

752
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
After r600 hour of knowledge bike

753
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Woohoo

754
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,024
That way

755
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,864
604 after this episode

756
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
Clip we finish up

757
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
The matters at hand for August

758
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
12

759
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
In this clip Alex is talking about

760
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
Severe the situation is

761
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
How the global is really want to take out people like him

762
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
And also want to take out people

763
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Like this other guy

764
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,672
He's a representative his first name is also a representative

765
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
And he apparently has

766
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:20,096
The 28 pages from the 9/11 report that proved that Saudi Arabia was behind it

767
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
911

768
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
What's criminal forces in our government that Alex

769
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Cell

770
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,568
And then also he wants to get John Boehner out of the

771
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Chair

772
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Position he wants to get him out

773
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
We all

774
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
Imagine going back to those times

775
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
John Boehner out with R&B

776
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
Probably

777
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:47,232
Could sort of read the tea leaves as it were and see the John Boehner was about done

778
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
Movement where he has

779
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,912
And they talked about how we got to get her out of there

780
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Set the groundwork for a victory

781
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,056
But they already know is going to happen with or without any action on their part

782
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Amazon

783
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
They are going to f***

784
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Can kill this guy

785
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Because he

786
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
He's coming out and saying all this

787
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
S*** and it relates to Alex

788
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Atlantic

789
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Exaggerate

790
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Nth Degree

791
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
Lunacy

792
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,288
I'll guarantee

793
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,272
Killing killing killing me

794
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,624
Killing killing

795
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
Believe in the criminal Council

796
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
I know it'll blow up in their face

797
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
But

798
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
A nuke goes off in a major city and then it's just a footnote a bunch of people

799
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
They're going all

800
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
To kill him and in order

801
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Alex Jones

802
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
This is

803
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
Possibly delusions of grandeur that is that is the biggest

804
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,752
The building went up in a fire at but there was one guy

805
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,800
Killed by a bullet

806
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Sting

807
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,016
Storyline of Columbo

808
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,064
Mr. president

809
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,536
Alex Jones and strychnine in his body but it says he was killed by a nuke

810
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
That's crazy

811
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,776
Insane

812
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Another city

813
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,664
I thought it was going to be like they murder him

814
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,064
Then drop the nuclear bomb on it to cover it up and meanwhile in Austin Alex

815
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
Kick the bucket

816
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
But also

817
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
You started to notice

818
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,768
You keep saying katie-bar-the-door

819
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah and that's another like steal your hand Kennewick

820
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
What the f*** is he saying

821
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
You never heard

822
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
Malik

823
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
And I know

824
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,568
Contacts that meme

825
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,408
But never heard that one either

826
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Trouble's Brewing

827
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
You know I get that

828
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Context clues

829
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
I looked it up really

830
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
Skewers Scottish thing

831
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
I didn't know that I've never heard that

832
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Alex says it all the time

833
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
He's Welsh

834
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Itsfunneh

835
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,328
It has a good ring to it doesn't Rhythm Katy Bar the Door

836
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Shady Bar the Door

837
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
The Scotts

838
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
We know

839
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Where help

840
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
We're literally Hill piccata

841
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Okay

842
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
Alright well I mean

843
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,040
Yeah sound off on Facebook our new Facebook page

844
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,600
If you ever heard of the door

845
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Genealogy

846
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Your understanding of colloquialism

847
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
Those two things are important for us to gauge

848
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,144
Also on the August 12th show

849
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
Good segments with Anthony gucciardi

850
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,776
Where they sit around and talk about how great their pills are

851
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Now pretty good

852
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
They just had one

853
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Guys

854
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
I f***** up

855
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,440
I thought it was good look at this f****** rash this is brutal

856
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,744
We're going to get to a really weird

857
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Testimonial about his pills

858
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
In a little bit

859
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:15,520
Yeah yeah weird but we got to start August 13th here and

860
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
Presidential hopefuls

861
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,688
Now most of his shows by talking about how

862
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Bush

863
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Is one of the big bows

864
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
Of the drug-running organizations

865
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
Is a drug lord basically

866
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,232
It's always the quiet one

867
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,560
Cocaine I'm bringing into the country

868
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
So Alex is

869
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
I think it might be a little bit off base on that

870
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
We're not here to defend

871
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Jeb Bush

872
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
But

873
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
Don't give a fuk

874
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,384
Alex goes on to say some other interesting things about other hopefuls

875
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,759
And we ever push it out me open at Planned Parenthood

876
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Nope

877
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
Push it out in the open

878
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
Geyserville home Institute

879
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
Can't recover the National Socialist Workers Party

880
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
If we're ever able to push out the organ harvesting of babies

881
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,871
Republican

882
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:52,543
100 blacks

883
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
And part of the Nazi operation

884
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,087
Does using

885
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Chopped up

886
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
So did he hears what I think he

887
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
PCS when

888
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
You

889
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Say abortion

890
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Egg scrambler

891
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Red

892
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
Winning around

893
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
Pull it right back out

894
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
You got little chunks

895
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,335
What's a baby right there

896
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,943
Probably fairly I got a baby

897
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,015
The bucket nonsense is if you really really hate abortion

898
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,343
Then you really really philosophically need to

899
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Support

900
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Contraception

901
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
And you need to

902
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
Support the morning-after pill

903
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,767
And if you don't know

904
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
Then you did not about aboard

905
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
About something else

906
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
It's about women being punished for having

907
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,239
Ben Carson

908
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Is not a good candidate

909
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,359
For the job

910
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,175
He's doing now really a good brain surgeon

911
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
Qualify

912
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
He's not classically qualified to be in charge of Hud

913
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,143
Certainly he's not qualified don't there's no class

914
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
Play to qualify

915
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Do anything

916
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:31,359
He certainly not qualified to teach about the Antiquity ancient history

917
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,687
Green green silos pyramid

918
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
What have you

919
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
In our government

920
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
It's dubious.

921
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,879
Also if Alex Jones

922
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
Says there's a real black president

923
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,279
That I've ever heard where I'm like

924
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
No run

925
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,263
You don't want that Monica Legacy that's going to be you're going to be used as a race

926
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Strop

927
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,615
You run to use as a prop to do

928
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Barack Obama

929
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Some sort of

930
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Book

931
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
Can't remember what it's

932
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
Oh I got you

933
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,135
So it's interesting to me though.

934
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:20,767
We've got a situation where he's super into RAM Paul he's indicated that he trusts

935
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,815
Ted Cruz 95%

936
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
And now he's saying Ben Carson would be a great president

937
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Convoluted

938
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,007
His beliefs are and he claims he's not a Republican

939
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Meanwhile he's fine with

940
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,383
List of the mall in Rand Paul

941
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
Republican news

942
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Christian conservative a******

943
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,783
Crazy Ben Carson a lunatic

944
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
A complete Republican lunatic

945
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,903
And the thing that combines all of them is

946
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Severe distress

947
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
A Planned Parenthood

948
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
All liberal ideas

949
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
He's not really even

950
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Heathens

951
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,751
Yeah they are in the guns but it's not

952
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
I think that Alex Jones one of the things I'm starting to realize

953
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
Is that he doesn't Define himself as a positively

954
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
His beliefs are positive obligations there negative

955
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
Against

956
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
As opposed to being forth

957
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Well exactly

958
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:24,511
Well that's the entire as much as he is against

959
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
What what is

960
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Like

961
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
That's what they've been that's what the GOP in response

962
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
4-H

963
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,151
So they immediately got rid of any idea of well as

964
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
As well

965
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
What fox say said

966
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
McConnell

967
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
It's our job to make sure that

968
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
He doesn't get any

969
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
He's hot

970
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
Our only job

971
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Is to make sure he's the one

972
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Govern

973
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Not represent

974
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
Your people but just

975
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Delay

976
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
Distract

977
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Avoid

978
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
Didn't I do all of this stuff

979
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
So now all they have left

980
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Is we're against

981
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:09,055
There's no like an egg

982
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
Putting so much of their capital on being against

983
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,431
Obama care as opposed to

984
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
Creating something productive

985
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,039
What what is what is the age to be a butt

986
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
Cutting out all the good parts of Obamacare and leaving Obama

987
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
I'm taking money

988
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:27,999
Exactly Peter Pan

989
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
It's not something

990
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,911
It's not helping anybody it's not a positive thing it's not like you're introducing

991
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,239
Vhpa you're just taking Obamacare

992
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
Cutting out all of its inside

993
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
Pulling them out and then drink

994
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
The blood for yourself using rhetoric

995
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
About why you're doing it with legs

996
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
Suggestions of freedom

997
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
And that sort of stuff

998
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
You're going to be

999
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Is there any

1000
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Is there any

1001
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Positive

1002
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Legislation

1003
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
That the GOP why

1004
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
I don't think

1005
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,071
I don't know here's what we want to make

1006
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Here's something that we want

1007
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
As opposed to

1008
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,703
Here's all the stuff that we want

1009
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
That we don't want

1010
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,591
I'm sure that there are if you get down to some lower level I bet there are

1011
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:19,455
Maybe in state legislatures and stuff like that because

1012
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
If it's anything like

1013
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,527
Kansas they're going to have all go to

1014
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,671
F****** s*** anyways it's hard to get away from this feeling but I don't fully accept

1015
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,767
The idea that there is no moderate Republicans anymore

1016
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
And I think it's I think that it appears that way certainly on a national scale but I'm positive that there are

1017
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Within

1018
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Within States within local bodies

1019
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
And stuff like that

1020
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Are we getting

1021
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
Into trouble the trouble there is

1022
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
Is very simple

1023
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
To make

1024
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
It is

1025
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
The same thing with police

1026
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
I know

1027
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
There are a lot of good

1028
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Yam

1029
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
But

1030
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
If you are fine

1031
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
With

1032
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
The bad police murdering people

1033
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
I don't really think you're good

1034
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
That's true

1035
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,351
Qualifying

1036
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Look I get it you don't

1037
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Think you're racist

1038
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
And maybe you're not

1039
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
You think that it's all about tax

1040
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,567
But you're fine with those f**** right over there

1041
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
Yeah there's a boy

1042
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Oh you get a

1043
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
You get a different star

1044
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Yeah

1045
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,247
You know it's either you are

1046
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
Going to break

1047
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
No

1048
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
They're not Republican

1049
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
They're not conservatives they're just

1050
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,255
Walking racist being part of a group does not preclude your responsibilities of the

1051
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
So we know now

1052
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
About

1053
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
These people

1054
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
Alex support

1055
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,567
Love them but we haven't heard anything

1056
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,383
Luckily Alex

1057
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:57,759
FrontRunner for a year

1058
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,575
Really now in the middle of the pack

1059
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
Because of the Donald Trump

1060
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Extravaganza

1061
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,631
I think I like the fact he's aggressive he doesn't apologize that's the fresh

1062
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
He's confident knowledge

1063
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,287
Bloomy wants president

1064
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
Mesa Flea Market

1065
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
And pull the world out of a depression

1066
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:43,839
And a single-family home and

1067
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,423

1068
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,263

CV global

1070
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,831
I don't see Donald Trump

1071
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
I smell a big snake

1072
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,311
That's not alright

1073
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Yeah

1074
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Okay

1075
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,687
So he's giving

1076
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:37,855
Okay we're still right there on that I love all the Stuffies

1077
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
I love how

1078
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,975
He's not but I like she's got a big ass I love to slap it

1079
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
Like

1080
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,559
But Alex's if I don't think he really believes

1081
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,167
Alex is a fake smart version of those people who we all

1082
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,007
No I'm baby I was guilty of this for a very short. Of time

1083
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Where is a

1084
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
Hey man

1085
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
It would be fun

1086
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:03,199
Freezing like it would be like we have chocolate Sunday

1087
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Is a holiday or whatever you fill in the blank

1088
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
Whatever lunacy

1089
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
What happened

1090
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
I'd like we'd be a circus

1091
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,415
I think that Alex is

1092
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,463
Country we are very much

1093
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:20,863
Dark carnival

1094
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,495
Actually I'll be much more comfortable with my brothers out there my apps

1095
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
Seems like

1096
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823

00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
I just don't need that

1104
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,335
I'm trying to get press passes go to the Gathering

1105
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895
Play but I always f*** it up

1106
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,687
Anyway I'd love to go

1107
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,503
Do you want to go get me press passes to go to the Gathering

1108
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
In

1109
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,647
To cover the Alex Jones Goes to the Gathering

1110
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
They would eat him

1111
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
They would be

1112
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,023
Funny smart for Alex

1113
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
I think there's probably an overlapping audience

1114
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
But I don't think it would be

1115
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Cuz I think

1116
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
She would also hate

1117
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,079
Probably thinks they're getting into

1118
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
Some kind of satanic cult

1119
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
Opinions

1120
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,039
But

1121
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,343
Discovered his position

1122
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
Still thinks he's untrustworthy

1123
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,791
Here's in this next clip Alex gets into his feelings about the Russian

1124
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,423
The show but here's here's where he's at with them

1125
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,823
Infowars.com

1126
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Combat Russian media

1127
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,687
As I prepared

1128
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,015
Colorado Lucien inside Russia

00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,575
Talk about stirring up the Russians

1130
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
This is what Obama's

1132
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,631

Village from a cartoon or something

1134
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,431
That's a bad way to look at the world

1135
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:55,487
All of it is just George Soros launching color revolutions around

1136
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Spring

1137
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,071

00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
Green is lime soda is a revolution

1141
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Not bad limes a great flavor

1142
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
Glad I had that moment

1143
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
I couldn't sleep

1144
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
Thought about what

1145
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,623
Myself

1146
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,207
Please send them there while you were yelling he says Russia did nothing wrong

1147
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
Russia

1148
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
To do a lot of Rock

1149
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,727
In the future from there

1150
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,103
Not granted a lot of stuff about the hacking and a lot of stuff about the interfering in our election

1151
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
Wasn't really publicly known at this point

1152
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
They had just

1153
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
Started their campaign apparently

1154
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,319
But the FBI has said that it started in the summer of 2015

1155
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
To go on there I'll give Alex

1156
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
Credit for not knowing about that

1157
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,815
Anything to us

1158
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
So

1159
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,399
What where we at

1160
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,727
I don't know I think it was the way that we

1161
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
The way that we talked about

1162
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
A few episodes

1163
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
Citgo was

1164
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
They know that something happened

1165
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
They're just trying to

1166
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
To figure out the best way to hand

1167
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,967
We don't have to

1168
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
Fight a World War

1169
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,063
Right

1170
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
So

1171
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
It's hard

1172
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
What's happening now with

1173
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,439
Like the more and more

1174
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Coming out very very

1175
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Slowly it's like

1176
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
S***

1177
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,167
Vital War it's been coming out is really really strong indications

1178
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
Was personally involved

1179
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
And Racine

1180
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Evidence

1181
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,543
Starting to come out

1182
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:50,687
That that pretty strong indications that voter rolls were at least which could have

1183
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:55,807
Disenfranchised voters made them ineligible to vote cancelled out their vote

1184
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
There's a lot of strong indications

1185
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
People are saying

1186
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
3 States

1187
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
17 Somerset

1188
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
At very least it was like 20

1189
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
Which is very much like

1190
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
That's inactive

1191
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,287
The war that's a literal Act

1192
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
The stuff that we've

1193
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,919
I mean there is that to unpack but it's too difficult

1194
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
Item

1195
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
I'm not Charmed

1196
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,551
By the argument hey it's okay they did it to us cuz we do it two people

1197
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:31,391
I didn't say that was a donut

1198
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
Position to have

1199
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:38,815
But it's very serious they did it to us and we should stop doing it to other people

1200
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,375
Yeah I think

1201
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
Right I think those are two positions that are compatible

1202
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
These sorts of things

1203
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
Very very very serious

1204
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,175
Reno in 2015

1205
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
They're not doing anything to us so we shouldn't

1206
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
Be mad we now restarting

1207
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,575
Proceed there's pretty good evidence

1208
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
You should be mad

1209
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Wellington

1210
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,671
Craziest like did you read the the

1211
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Washington Post

1212
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,535
Obama article the one thing that

1213
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
Boggled my mind

1214
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
It's coming off like

1215
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,143
Because the headline basic

1216
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
Obama didn't do enough

1217
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Regret that

1218
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
And it's like

1219
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
Every time he went

1220
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Regio Pee-wee

1221
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Any of them

1222
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
From

1223
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
A state

1224
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
From anywhere

1225
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Didn't want to

1226
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,319
8 years of we hate you built

1227
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,343
So anything's

1228
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,671
Any alarm he's trying to sound is not going to be listened to

1229
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
So

1230
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
So yeah and

1231
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
You could you could take that as like that

1232
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
You know is that evidence

1233
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Of collusion

1234
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Some people but

1235
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
Your your reaction to it is

1236
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Is way better which

1237
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
These guys

1238
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
Hated Obama so much

1239
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,031
They were willing to let the country

1240
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:58,687
It could be a mixed bag it's certainly possible that both of those things are slightly true

1241
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,319
Alex is literally talking about in this case is

1242
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Setting up Outpost

1243
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,647
To fight Russian propaganda

1244
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Yeah go Russians

1245
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:14,815
Whether they are our big bad guy or not there's arguments you could see on both sides at least until

1246
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,143
Stage of 2015

1247
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,703
They are notorious for propaganda

1248
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
Really good at Cold War that's been a really big piece of their Warfare tactics

1249
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,943
They had to their weight

1250
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,503
They're amazing

1251
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,391
And so I don't really see anything to evil or nefarious but the idea of setting up

1252
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,487
An outpost in Lithuania and work against

1253
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
The Insidious influence

1254
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
End

1255
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,143
Destabilizing influences Russia

1256
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,703
Just be like

1257
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,775
Dan friesenhaus for this

1258
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,847
Began to show called knowledge fight

1259
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:04,735
That's what it is it's just it's just hey

1260
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
They're lying

1261
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,063
Let's stream

1262
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
People how to know when there

1263
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Being lied to

1264
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:16,511
Do you know if your birthday or is it propaganda

1265
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
The thing is it's there is a fine line between

1266
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,679
We live in such a f*****-up time.

1267
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
For everybody lies all the time

1268
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:32,383
Becomes a thing where if you're really just trying to poke holes and propaganda the other side isn't real IQ propaganda

1269
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,407
It's just

1270
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:40,063
Exactly what happened with the fake news idea like the fake news is supposed to be about

1271
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
Propaganda

1272
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
President Bush

1273
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Yeah

1274
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,887
We live we live on the global playground

1275
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:00,543
That's the idea that I had during the

1276
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Ramp up to

1277
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
To the election

1278
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
Just scared the s*** out of me

1279
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
In the primary

1280
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Raise even

1281
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
That was

1282
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,455
There are no adults

1283
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,247
Right this isn't going like

1284
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
You always

1285
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,063
Kind of get the cents growing up

1286
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
That like

1287
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,391
When you're a kid

1288
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,463
Straighten this out

1289
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,535
The idea during the primaries

1290
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,911
You know it's crazy now but someone

1291
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
This isn't going to work

1292
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
You can't you can't do this

1293
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
You're having fun

1294
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,847
Bitstop kind of there where it's like

1295
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
Okay

1296
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
Miller

1297
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
He's going to just

1298
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,455
Step in and there's going to be like

1299
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Guys

1300
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
We f***** up

1301
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,319
We're going to put them in jail and we'll do this all over again

1302
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
But now everybody

1303
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
I think it's a self-defense

1304
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,535
Homecoming is incredibly scary

1305
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,863
But the once you make sense of the fact that help isn't coming you can be

1306
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Become the help

1307
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
That you wanted

1308
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
And I think that the reason

1309
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
He is a director

1310
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Revelate

1311
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,127
Response to the revolution

1312
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
No one's going to take out Alex

1313
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
Come out necessarily

1314
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:16,063
But no one's going to work against him and I'm uniquely situated to do so

1315
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
So

1316
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
On a very small scale

1317
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
I'm here to help

1318
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
That's what that's all week

1319
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
That's the best we can do

1320
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,607
We've been served document

1321
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Alex Jones

1322
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,447
And his relationship with his own path

1323
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:36,287
As it relates to abortion right

1324
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
It's really weird about

1325
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,895
I do not judge

1326
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
I started to psychology

1327
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
That makes no sense

1328
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,743
Especially if it was early on whatever

1329
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,375
Realize you were fooled you were deceived

1330
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,727
So Alex is talking about himself

1331
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
Projecting like crazy

1332
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,871
Into the abortion game

1333
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:48,223
Because they're guilty about their past is him talking about how guilty

1334
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Which is why

1335
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,551
Jesus pooping

1336
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
That people were trying to

1337
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
To use his

1338
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
Guilt

1339
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
To make him think that abortion is okay

1340
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
When we all just in his own head

1341
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
8th psalm

1342
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
It's all entire episode the function of

1343
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
Are those that streams

1344
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
Videos telling a caller

1345
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Is

1346
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
Him sayings

1347
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,287
I felt that guilt and they tried to get

1348
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
But I Rose above

1349
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,639
I Rose above it I'm one of the rare ones

1350
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,199
Who's able to not get Waldo down and guilt

1351
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
Which is insane

1352
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Clearly he's wallet

1353
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
Guilt about it

1354
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
And

1355
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,927
That whole f****** idea of whatever it was in my heart is all that matters

1356
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
Clutch

1357
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
Escapist Christian idea

1358
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,583
It's so like alright I beat that guy's ass but I meant well

1359
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,679
Preacher

1360
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
And I was like

1361
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Abortion

1362
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
But

1363
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,687
Confessed in front of God and man

1364
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,271
Yep never have to worry about again

1365
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:59,903
Slandering Planned Parenthood in Margaret are all over the place

1366
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
Pay for an abortion

1367
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,863
He says he's paid for multiple ones in that past web

1368
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
I don't know

1369
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
I don't know

1370
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
I feel like it's irresponsible for us

1371
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
Speculate

1372
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,543
We know nothing about

1373
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,199
Alex is f****** dumb

1374
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,503
Dallas

1375
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,575
Racist black people

1376
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,119
Does that mean

1377
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,215
Incredible culture

1378
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,799
Manny

1379
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
More racist black people have seen white people

1380
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,479
Which would be

1381
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Imposter

1382
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
I think so

1383
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,343
That would literally would be impossible

1384
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,439
Well the reason possible is if you

1385
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,231
Don't think the races

1386
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
Things are rapists

1387
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:14,655
Like he's gone on his show and talked about how blacks

1388
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,935
Gavin McInnes

1389
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
To come on and say that most

1390
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,007
The Black Faces Reverend

1391
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:24,383
Well it's I mean it's just take that as a microcosm argument make sense

1392
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
In his mind

1393
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
Because nothing he does is racist

1394
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,271
So the only racist things that happen

1395
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,575
Are done by people who aren't

1396
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
Exactly like him which is a racist racist

1397
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
Further you allows the rationalizations in the b******* that

1398
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
Would say about their action

1399
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
Of course

1400
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
As legitimate

1401
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,039
Like so dismissive

1402
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,623
Whereas he would not get the same

1403
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
He's just

1404
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
You f****** raped

1405
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Yeah you know so

1406
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
And also

1407
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
I want to know what black leaders

1408
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,423
You talk to Khalid Muhammad

1409
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
Carte blanche to say whatever the

1410
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,823
The f*** you want

1411
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Anyway

1412
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
So

1413
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:34,015
Later on the show he has an interview with his newly-hired invest

1414
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
Navigate of reporter Wayne Madsen

1415
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
Oh how long did Wayne stick around

1416
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
Around 42 episode so far

1417
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
Clinton

1418
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
Cook was murdered

1419
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
And this is the key to everything

1420
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:53,727
Hillary Clinton cook was murdered

1421
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
Was found

1422
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
With a note on him

1423
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,895
Contact Larry Nichols

1424
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,199
Which

1425
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Something is not right

1426
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
That's a real thing

1427
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
No that's what he said

1428
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,855
There's no way

1429
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,647
So anyway apparently this cook

1430
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,439
He was the White House chef

1431
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,255
On 911 something about

1432
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
Now I'm

1433
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,095
Just thinking about how much fun it would be

1434
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Just wandered around and

1435
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Every time we

1436
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
We found a dead body we

1437
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,447
We just put a note on there

1438
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,983
Call Larry Nichols

1439
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,543
We have his number

1440
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
We can do that

1441
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
We should call Larry Nicholson ask about that cook

1442
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:36,991
That's a good maybe we'll get back to that

1443
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
This time

1444
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,599
We have to let him know that we were record

1445
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,975
Webster's

1446
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
Jeb Bush

1447
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,351
The reporting that he gets into

1448
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,399
I don't really care it's not

1449
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
It's not good

1450
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,239
But it does say that Trump

1451
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Is a pause

1452
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Mind you

1453
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:05,407
Show Donald Trump is like a millionaire Archie Bunker

1454
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Poop

1455
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:15,647
I got the point of Archie Bunker

1456
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
Archetype of an old race

1457
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
Yep so I went back and I watched

1458
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Some clips from All in the Family

1459
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,375
It's way worse than you remember he says like

1460
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:31,519
F****** he calls black people Coons all the time he claims that all Europeans are facts

1461
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:37,151
Like it's insane right because I started looking around today

1462
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,247
There is a sizable YouTube Community

1463
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
That believes

1464
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,831
That Archie Bunker was at like a warning

1465
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Of the truth

1466
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,231
There's a different number of people who put out videos about how like

1467
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
This was this was like

1468
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,071
Subtle warning that we all just

1469
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:02,239
Finding the truth in All in the Family

1470
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Yep

1471
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
Dude

1472
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,591
Open a open a book

1473
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
Just one

1474
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,247
The other thing too is that like those videos about how Archie Bunker was like a prophet

1475
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,039
I'd like 400,000 views

1476
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
Me

1477
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
Bums me out

1478
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
Archie Bunker was a prophet

1479
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
No

1480
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Got it all

1481
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,791
So

1482
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,863
They also another thing is being I like vehicle at

1483
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Narrative

1484
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,447
Spinning along as as it does

1485
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,007
He's mentioning that you need to buy gold

1486
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
September

1487
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,455
You know you're putting you putting these time frames on

1488
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
Things I want you to hold off on that

1489
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,855
Because before he gets into another interview

1490
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,391
You got to do a little sale

1491
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,719
I want to tell you that you know all these other places like

1492
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
TBS

1493
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
Cuz your taxes go to them

1494
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
MSNBC

1495
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,215
They get tons of taxpayer money

1496
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,031
Just to give f****** Rachel Maddow raised

1497
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
But not him

1498
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:15,711
He's based on free will

1499
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,527
MSNBC

1500
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,511

He's on a bit

1511
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,207
He's in the Peter Schiff League

1512
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
Of Alex Jones

1513
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,815
Terms of these sort of out there

1514
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
Economist

1515
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
The come on

1516
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,471
I want to deal with the premise that Alex is making that he's based on free will

1517
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,031
Are you getting a gun to your head saying you got a pack

1518
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Now

1519
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
Maybe true

1520
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
But

1521
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:19,199
All of his premise

1522
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,759
Are based on

1523
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,111
The globalists are doing things to you by the water that you drink

1524
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,463
Rattling the foods you man I'm so because I'm scaring you

1525
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,767
You are not going to be a complete healthy

1526
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,327
The person unless you take the

1527
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,631
Which is kind of a gun to the Head

1528
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,911
Creating a problem

1529
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
That

1530
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,263
I will insist his life

1531
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,823
Providing the solution

1532
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
Which is life

1533
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
Yeah it's a problem reaction

1534
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
Pollution

1535
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
Essentially I am threatening

1536
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Until you

1537
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Take

1538
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,599
It's like you have a gun to your head

1539
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,647
And even worst we've already discussed

1540
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
About the

1541
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:08,351
Disaster narrative the economy is about to collapse only to have 10% of my resources as a guest

1542
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Here's the answer

1543
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,935
$50,000 an ounce

1544
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:16,799
So now on Alex's show here on this on this 13th day of August

1545
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
He's saying

1546
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,919
It's about Free Will I don't do no I'm not trying to

1547
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,223
I just you know if you like the stuff we do

1548
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,551
Like having Harry dance on your money

1549
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,927
On the show

1550
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:37,535
China is the greatest problem history it is finally coming unravel

1551
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
That's why I'm confidence

1552
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:49,055
Of the global bubble bursting against China was the first thing actually before that and Mark

1553
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
German

1554
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
The leading Market

1555
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:56,991
In Europe look like a dirty to me and then send in the China crash in late May

1556
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
And in the end of July and now I think the US markets are going to start heading down early stuff to

1557
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,231
Number probably peeking in the next week or two so

1558
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
I think this is happening

1559
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,047
Bill come back up

1560
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,863
Yeah

1561
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
It's within week

1562
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
So then weeks

1563
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
Is

1564
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
So irresponsible

1565
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,103
Like even eat like economy shows like

1566
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
Like Financial shows

1567
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,175
Shouldn't be saying s*** like that

1568
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
Like

1569
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
Factors

1570
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,783
And like really credentialed people

1571
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
Shouldn't be saying stuff

1572
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
Ignorant audience

1573
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
People will believe them

1574
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,767
Wework

1575
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
Economic

1576
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
Is

1577
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
Also a belief system

1578
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,679
Before with runs on the back

1579
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
Destroyed

1580
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,287
There is a shared

1581
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
Concept that

1582
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
The economy is going to go well

1583
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Cuz we're all parts

1584
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
And if you think it's going

1585
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
To fall apart

1586
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
You're going

1587
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,319
You can sabotage

1588
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
So the Aviv like constant

1589
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,183
Fear meta-narrative

1590
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,255
The economy is

1591
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Always

1592
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
Collapse

1593
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,095
Is

1594
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,703
It is basically saying all of society's always

1595
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,519
Yeah because it is

1596
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,567
Shared ID

1597
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,335
In one

1598
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
Economy

1599
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,431
Totally agree

1600
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
The whole thing

1601
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,039
He's coming down

1602
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Coming down

1603
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,671
Yeah but not in the same way

1604
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Feelings

1605
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,351
For sure

1606
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:54,751
Water in your house

1607
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Some Ramen

1608
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:01,919
Something like that a bad thing

1609
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,759
But it wasn't because of like

1610
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
Collapse or disasters is because we lived in Missouri there tornadoes destroyed

1611
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
By a tornado

1612
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,511
The basement would be safe and we could be down

1613
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
There anything

1614
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,191
100 reasons why

1615
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
If they have and put a blanket in your car

1616
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
Fill the rest of the base

1617
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,615
You hear me

1618
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
Are you crazy

1619
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
You build the basement out of gold

1620
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
Gold

1621
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Deflect

1622
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,295
Tornadoes everyone knows that

1623
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:45,695
That's why that's why Bill Gates is trying to get all the gold cuz he's got weather manipulation

1624
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Then you can't deflect the tornadoes all right

1625
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,119
It's f****** basic

1626
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
Supply and demand

1627
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,935
Alright well then you're right

1628
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
Guys I'm quoting

1629
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,263
Tornado

1630
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,567
Quotient

1631
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
I want them

1632
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,943
Coverage of the

1633
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,503
And as we see his position has not changed

1634
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
It's really on Trump at all

1635
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,319
The 14th

1636
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
Is incredibly f*****

1637
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:14,879
No s***

1638
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
Snow

1639
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
Necessarily

1640
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
But

1641
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
The show itself

1642
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,351
Is not really

1643
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
That gray

1644
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,727
There's not much going on on the show let me let me consult my notes

1645
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,007
Here are two

1646
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:31,775
To get to

1647
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,567
I want to take care of the important

1648
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,359
Pieces before we start playing clips

1649
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,431
Same Old Pro Rochester

1650
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
About how

1651
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,271
It's just a roast trying to start a color Revel

1652
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
Revolution

1653
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,319
Also

1654
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,111
Hillary's emails are now starting to

1655
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
And play

1656
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,695
The FBI had taken her server

1657
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Right at this point

1658
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:57,631
Turn off all that much that was

1659
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,191
It was basically the Planned Parenthood

1660
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,335
They have a Straight Outta Compton review

1661
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,871
Done by KISS Daniel

1662
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,271
Such a car is still around at this point

1663
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:19,903
The review is the CIA created rap music

1664
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
That's a

1665
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Definition

1666
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:26,559
Trusting review

1667
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,191
Peter Schiff who comes on to stress the disaster narrative the financial collapse

1668
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
Narrative

1669
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,775
And in this one they start talking about Peter Schiff

1670
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
Shift dab

1671
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
A bunch

1672
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,407
The political prisoner

1673
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
He's in prison

1674
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,735
Should not be

1675
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,063
It's and they say that it's because you wrote a book

1676
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,647
Called Federal Mafia

1677
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
About how you don't have to pay your taxes

1678
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,543
They don't really talk about that

1679
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,591
Political prisoner

1680
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,919
About how the things that he was charged with

1681
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,943
Were

1682
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:21,599
He didn't pay billions of dollars attacked early 80s

1683
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
Epsom salt

1684
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
I mean

1685
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,951
How long

1686
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
How long

1687
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,743
Has he been in jail for

1688
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,863
He is like a couple months after this point

1689
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
October

1690
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,495
How long did they say for like 10 years

1691
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Oh boy

1692
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
B b Hardware

1693
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
30 years of

1694
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
And

1695
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,575
The other thing is

1696
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,439
Because he was this guy was writing this book

1697
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:01,535
Where you don't have to pay taxes all of these people ended up going

1698
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,863
He screwed over a lot of people with

1699
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,703
Very inaccurate information

1700
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:14,080
It was about self-enrichment

1701
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Toupee

1702
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Was fake

1703
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,200
And so they ended up

1704
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,248
Defrauding the government of over

1705
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,296
Things like 70 million dollars

1706
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,368
Just people who are directly associated with it

1707
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,184
And most of them got shorter prison sentences in him

1708
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,232
Because they didn't write a book

1709
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,536
Text

1710
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Contempt of court charge

1711
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:35,840
Because he

1712
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
Who acted up in court

1713
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
In some ways I'm not sure

1714
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,472
Yeah

1715
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,080
They all they do on the show is talk about how

1716
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,664
Because he wrote This Book

1717
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,224
And they allow people to sell the book

1718
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
But you can't sell the book

1719
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,296
And the reason that is

1720
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
Is because he can't

1721
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Prophet off the

1722
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,136
The crime

1723
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
It would be like

1724
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,952
Illegal

1725
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,512
According to the First Amendment

1726
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,328
To be out there it would be adequate

1727
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,472
They're like if I didn't pay tax

1728
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,544
Here's how I would

1729
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,128
Took the book can exist but he can't make money off of

1730
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
Ended up just giving away for free online

1731
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,576
Stephen Curry

1732
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
He did time

1733
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,328
Yeah and here's the f***** up

1734
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,656
And when he was first getting charged

1735
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,752
He taught him and his lawyer tried to use essentially in insanity

1736
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,384
Defend that a mental disorder caused him to have these beliefs

1737
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,688
He shouldn't be held responsible

1738
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,248
Okay now was it then what

1739
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
Well here you just let him keep telling the butt

1740
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Here

1741
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Here's the thing

1742
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,160
That is him trying

1743
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
But

1744
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
His ankle on it was

1745
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
No no no

1746
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,560
I did that because I wanted to

1747
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Get in front of a jury

1748
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,400
They would have just had a judge decided

1749
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,960
If I hadn't have tried to do

1750
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:21,312
Like I don't

1751
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:24,128
Is I mean God Rest his soul

1752
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
Whatever

1753
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,176
I don't care

1754
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:31,040
He was in prison for million-dollar

1755
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,856
No

1756
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
Easy bucking libertarian

1757
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
Who thinks

1758
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,952
The taxes are a crime against

1759
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,256
Write the taxation is violence

1760
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,632
I just I just wanted to show these people the world

1761
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,680
Did they think they want to live in

1762
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:52,544
Because it's f****** insane yeah absolutely

1763
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,312
You know what

1764
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:57,408
If you want to be a Libertarian and that way you can do it

1765
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Go to a f******

1766
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,712
Forest

1767
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Builder

1768
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
Your cabin and hunt

1769
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,576
That you don't have to pay taxes on

1770
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,160
Yeah as long as it's long as nobody's

1771
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,000
He's there and nobody knows than fine live your libertarian idea

1772
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,584
But just know you won't have electricity you won't have f****** roads

1773
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,424
Your kids won't go to school all of this is because of taxes

1774
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,728
And if you are a libertarian

1775
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Take your f******

1776
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,520
Kid out of school

1777
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,848
Throw your phone in the garbage get rid of all of this s***

1778
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
Because you don't get it

1779
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,712
Quite frankly that's because we've already had the conversation

1780
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:38,112
Society has decided decided that collectively we can create a much better

1781
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Place to live

1782
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,928
Then killing things in the woods

1783
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,976
With no electricity and no Netflix

1784
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
If you're a libertarian

1785
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
You're not allowed to watch that

1786
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,168
You can watch Hulu

1787
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,496
19 +

1788
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
Some crazy s***

1789
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,848
But the stuff I want to talk about more

1790
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
Is a narrative

1791
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,432
There is a

1792
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Every now and again

1793
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
Alex Jones

1794
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,088
His show has a beginning middle and end

1795
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
But logically make sense

1796
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
I'm there was a storyline that goes throughout it

1797
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488
That he did not intend

1798
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
And this episode

1799
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
I'm going

1800
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,584
To lay out

1801
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
The exact narrative

1802
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,936
And it's way more f***** up than you can possibly imagine

1803
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
So here's the first clip

1804
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:29,056
Or he's talking about Rita's reading review

1805
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,872
From the internet of his product brain for

1806
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,320
Wash from

1807
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
Call City California

1808
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,720
What's what's happening

1809
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
I cannot stress enough

1810
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,544
Missing screws or loose screws miad

1811
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,104
Great concentration and focus

1812
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,784
Galaxy force

1813
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,696
And that's what's so amazing about a bottle

1814
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Quan

1815
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,280
Gross

1816
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,656
My brain Force

1817
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,456
Don't waste your time

1818
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,040
That are prescription in Europe prescription Europe

1819
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,208
He took a pill

1820
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,304
Are you not cape

1821
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Bilal

1822
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
Love seeing how

1823
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
If you don't take it

1824
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Can't you feel it

1825
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,288
That's not the same thing as taking it makes me feel good

1826
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
If I don't

1827
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
4 after

1828
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,736
Having smoked

1829
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
10 years old

1830
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
I feel it

1831
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
You know I'm nervous I'm

1832
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
That's called addiction

1833
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,744
He's describing essentially withdrawals

1834
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,560
So is that review

1835
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
And Alex

1836
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
Pop the pill

1837
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,888
On the show

1838
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,728
Is the beginning of the narrative

1839
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
Cuz we get to watch

1840
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,336
To somebody who takes brainforce

1841
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,384
Yes something actually happened

1842
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,504
Oh yeah

1843
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,040
It's unclear

1844
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,880
It's all probably it's probably like a homeopathy

1845
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
We'll see what the I don't think

1846
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,256
I don't think there's anything

1847
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
Let me be perfectly clear

1848
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:05,216
It does not do what is on label

1849
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
But it's

1850
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
It's really crazy

1851
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,080
Cuz about half an hour after he takes a pill

1852
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,104
Keychain

1853
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,432
Exactly what happened

1854
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
You've got to make some other b******* claim

1855
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
What if it was just

1856
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,512
Don't think so either but

1857
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
Next thing is

1858
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
Just absolutely insane

1859
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,224
Constitutionalist haven't done anything to anybody

1860
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,808
83 cops a year

1861
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:01,024
Clap shofar

1862
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,072
For the

1863
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,728
That's what the lowest crime rates of any group out there

1864
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,600
What Constitution was a self-fulfilling prophecy

1865
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:31,488
Let's Talk About Us haven't done anything to end

1866
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:35,584
For Colored Girls 45 cops

1867
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,352
But that's

1868
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,656
Here's some headlines from this week

1869
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,192
Just about this

1870
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:44,800
Judge sentences Sovereign Citizen 12 years in prison for Oakridge Rampage

1871
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,360
That story is about a guy

1872
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Was convicted of one count

1873
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:52,992
Of Reckless homicide and aggravated assault

1874
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:58,368
He drove in Reverse through a crowd of about 200 people during the 4th of July 2015

1875
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
Firework show

1876

Airpark

1877
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,208
That Sovereign citizen who did that

1878
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
Another one

1879
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
Computers taking too long to load up

1880
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:11,680
Sovereign citizens with my Wi-Fi

1881
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,592
Oakridge

01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
Monday

1883
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
Two stories about sting

1884
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,064
My bad

1885
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:35,488
Add a Fourth of July that's Americana was it,

1886
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,256
No that's fine

1887
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,632
Also if you don't if you don't know about Sovereign citizen

1888
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,704
All of you out there listening I highly encourage

1889
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Look it up on YouTube

1890
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Cuz

1891
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
They're f******

1892
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Hilarious

1893
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:53,664
If you take out all of the like they do kill people stuff

1894
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:56,224
Watching them argue in court

1895
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
So funny

1896
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,296
There's a argue in court

1897
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,856
But they don't believe that they are sovereign

1898
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,208
They don't believe in the Integrity or the right of the Court

1899
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,072
They believe that America was established on like admiralty law maritime law

1900
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,096
AmVet

1901
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,144
So here's everybody was just

1902
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
Forgotten

1903
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
It's a secret

1904
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,312
The secret behind the scenes knows the truth

1905
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,336
But they don't tell you

1906
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,128
You know on your government documents

1907
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,920
Your name is in capital letters

1908
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
Yes you do you know that me

1909
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
The capital letters

1910
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,784
That's not you as a

1911
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Person

1912
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,112
That's you as a financial entity

1913
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,184
Right you are just created in order to get

1914
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,744
Debt put into your name under the

1915
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,792
Capital letters version of your name

1916
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
No you

1917
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:48,448
A lowercase ordain as a human flashing

1918
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,240
Blood that's your Sovereign it

1919
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,288
But the capital letters

1920
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,824
That's the tax identity

1921
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
So every time you go to court

1922
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
If you go to court

1923
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
There

1924
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
Quarter all these capital letters

1925
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
That's not you as a person

1926
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
They're trying

1927
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,552
Tax identity

1928
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,088
Starts crying weight

1929
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:08,416
As a financial entity

1930
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,952
And never speak again

1931
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,536
Argument is on

1932
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
Capitalization of letters

1933
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:19,680
That's a big part of it

1934
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
Authority

1935
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,288
Awesome stuff

1936
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,104
Are some of the judges

1937
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
A really they try

1938
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,432
They try to treat them

1939
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,736
Okay well let's see what is

1940
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
What are you trying

1941
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
Could you make sense

1942
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344
Crazy person

1943
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,184
But there was a there's one where an old man is in court

1944
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,744
Eventually just gets

1945
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,304
Really fed up and so she goes to Chambers

1946
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,544
Left

1947
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,104
All the charges are dropped she has left the court

1948
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,384
And so he leaves

1949
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,224
It gets in the car and that there is an addendum

1950
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
You got arrested that I say

1951
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:10,112
Are contempt of court charges

1952
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:13,184
These people are they are really

1953
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
It's really funny

1954
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:17,024
To see these videos on YouTube

1955
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,328
But the dangerous ramifications of it is

1956
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,888
If you don't believe in any of the authority thing

1957
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:25,472
You do think that any cop who pulls you over is a grasping upon

1958
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,032
Alright also another part of sovereignty

1959
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,312
Citizen identity is

1960
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,104
In order to be

1961
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
Your whole

1962
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
Lowercase

1963
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Lettered

1964
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,968
Soul version of yourself

1965
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,248
The human version

1966
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,528
You have to renounce

1967
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,832
The capital letter version of yourself

1968
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,648
And to do so you have to write a letter

1969
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,952
And send your ID

1970
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,768
And like your identification documents

1971
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,328
Back to the government and tell them that you

1972
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
Give them a notice

1973
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,144
Of your rejection

1974
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,424
Of the text

1975
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Entity

1976
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:01,056
Version of yourself

1977
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,616
You now if you were ever driving

1978
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
You don't have an ID

1979
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,504
So if you get pulled over by a cop your automatically going to at least get a ticket

1980
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
Maybe arrest

1981
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,856
So every time a sovereign citizen runs into a cop

1982
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,928
It's basically a situation where they're going to get arrested

1983
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,232
So it really is a powder keg

1984
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
In a lot of weight

1985
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,792
See the thing

1986
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
I just

1987
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,448
It sounds to me like the world's shittiest religion

1988
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,776
It basically is because

1989
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,104
Like the idea

1990
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,128
Yes

1991
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Okay

1992
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
Sure

1993
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:42,784
The government and the laws have been around for 300 years or whatever

1994
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,064
But

1995
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
Have you can

1996
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
Considered that maybe

1997
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
They made it type

1998
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
Maritime law

1999
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,744
None of it applies to

2000
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
What what

2001
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,840
It's not it's not like

2002
01:33:56,096 --> 01:34:00,448
It's not like Cinderella where it's like always if you don't sign this by midnight

2003
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
Ignominy

2004
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,264
It's not it's not a heck

2005
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,336
Magic

2006
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
No

2007
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:10,944
It is an extreme version of distrust

2008
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Of the government

2009
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,760
It's an extreme version of libertarian

2010
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,344
Pieces of

2011
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,648
Their belief is

2012
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,416
The government

2013
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,952
Shouldn't have any

2014
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
Supposed to have any

2015
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,024
Control over traveling

2016
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,632
Vacancy

2017
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,704
Steve of like driving as traveling

2018
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,008
And so like

2019
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:35,776
Instatravel

2020
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,800
You're not traveling

2021
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,384
You're driving

2022
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,688
I did a lot of looking into them a while back

2023
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,712
And it's f****** fast

2024
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:44,992
But

2025
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:50,880
If you're not an idiot and you look at it you realize that this is a real short walk

2026
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:54,208
From real serious problems

2027
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,488
Beams

2028
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,792
Don't get arrested a bunch

2029
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
People. Respect

2030
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,120
Police means you're going to get arrested a bunch

2031
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Beans

2032
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,656
You're going to

2033
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
To feel like

2034
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
They don't have any

2035
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,240
Authority to arrest

2036
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
And you're already

2037
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:18,528
And you're not going to be threatened in the same way

2038
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
Nissan systematic oppression over

2039
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,344
You're going to

2040
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
The fuel

2041
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
Threatened

2042
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,976
A real Philly maritime law based

2043
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,512
Admiralty thing

2044
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
Delusion

2045
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,656
Watch some of these YouTube videos when they're amazing

2046
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,240
So Alex gets down that road

2047
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,128
Break the prison station.

2048
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,176
For rent for the ride starts

2049
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,992
And swirled around in that in them guts

2050
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
Alex gets on a little bit of a rant

2051
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,856
Orgeat

2052
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,648
You start by talking about how honest

2053
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Pistachios

2054
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
Then

2055
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,280
A bit about his girlfriend

2056
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,816
I am it just goes from

2057
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,584
Of course

2058
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,400
The sheriff says we're Liars

2059
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,960
I remember the articles

2060
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,776
Around about last year when all this bro

2061
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:16,896
Infowars or Liars

Chinese files from Pluto

2064
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,584
I agree

2065
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,376
I want to be the truth

2066
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,472
Truthful

2067
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,288
Girlfriend stuff with ask me

That's why they always attack cuz I got my phone

2071
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
This is where it gets real

2072
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,816
Yeah I'm about to

2073
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,864
I'm about to see this go

2074
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
Wild

2075
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,448
So this is just jumps off

2076
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
A mysterious way

2077
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,520
You can see a change

2078
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
Fascinating

2079
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,104
Always been involved

2080
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,152
Call fight Jaron

2081
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,224
14 years old

2082
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
I'm at a party

2083
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,256
His brothers getting drugs for cheerleaders

2084
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,216
Brother

2085
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,056
I wouldn't bother

2086
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,080
Cheerleader

2087
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:56,224
And he said yeah yeah

2088
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,552
I see cops

2089
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:10,304
The cop was just freaked out.

2090
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,704
You want me to kill you don't know what you doing

2091
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,152
I understood that stuff

2092
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,696
And Texas monthly didn't believe me so they went investigated

2093
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,768
Police Department

2094
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,328
Prostitutes

2095
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,632
Drugs Olive

2096
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,960
I wasn't involved

2097
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,520
Golf Course upper-middle-class neighborhood

2098
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,848
For myself

2099
01:38:55,872 --> 01:39:01,248
I want to stipulate a f*****-up story I want to stipulate that this one might be true

2100
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:06,112
The sheriff of Rockwall

2101
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:08,160
Did get busted for drug charges

2102
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,720
I can't find independent confirmation

2103
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,024
Call here's the thing

2104
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Alex is a liar

2105
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
That story

2106
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,144
About the Rockwall stress

2107
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
Came out in 2009

2108
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:22,496
There is an entire possibility that he built

2109
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,288
Fictitious passed for himself

2110
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,568
Based on the knowledge

2111
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,104
That story had broken

2112
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,712
You think it's possible that

2113
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,504
Keystone

2114
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
Roach like

2115
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,624
Like like

2116
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,160
The false recovered memories

2117
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:40,928
Yeah kind of

2118
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
It's like

2119
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,232
He saw that in your ghost

2120
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,024
Oh I remember when I was

2121
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
The part of that

2122
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,120
Although also

2123
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
The only reason that I think this

2124
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,192
Story sounds

2125
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
True

2126
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Is

2127
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,496
When he said

2128
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,800
They're getting drugs for

2129
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,568
Cheerleaders

2130
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:01,152
I thought it was better that he wasn't

2131
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
See I wouldn't take the drug

2132
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:09,856
We are giving them to Young impressionable women time

2133
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,624
Well

2134
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,392
Drugging

2135
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,720
That's what he's

2136
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,280
Witnesses buddies drug women

2137
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
Also I mean

2138
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,704
Sure there is the Cosby aspect to it but you got to also consider this was like mid-80s at the time you know

2139
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:31,104
Another one some Rave culture that was going on it. It's not necessarily that they were drugging people as much as maybe they were

2140
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,872
For supplying

2141
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,968
These cheerleaders that he's referencing

2142
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:40,320
Did want recreational drugs

2143
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:45,952
To me if if you go to a

2144
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:50,816
Join the party

2145
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,376
Don't go to a party like that if you're 12

2146
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:59,008
Party party

2147
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,544
Well that's a crime

2148
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,592
But the guy's a drug dealer

2149
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,152
Atlanta cop threatened to kill him

2150
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,736
I think some of the Talisman obvious

2151
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
Obviously

2152
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
Very bizarre couple years after his

2153
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,160
Termite poison

2154
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,512
Exposure I found pretty good evidence

2155
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
That

2156
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
An acute exposure

2157
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,632
Just like an hour even

2158
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,424
Call serious metal.

2159
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,264
Wow they've done studies

2160
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,360
As it relates to this story

2161
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:38,432
There's one possibility that he's not

2162
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,200
Lying

2163
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:45,088
Or like you said false recovered memories

2164
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,136
Hearing the story from

2165
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
2009

2166
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,952
But he's not done with Israel

2167
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:59,680
These experiences and I'm not going to be signed onto it

2168
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,808
I feel guilty enough

2169
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:22,464
Call.

2170
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,792
I feel guilty for all this stuff

2171
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
Okay

2172
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,824
Hispanic stores

2173
01:42:54,208 --> 01:43:00,352
You sonsabitches I'm sorry that talk like that

2174
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
Florida

2175
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
Running roughshod on people

2176
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,152
That's a normal male response

2177
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
No boy

2178
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:19,296
Don't shoot your advancement

2179
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
Your punk

2180
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,672
I don't watch them cops either

2181
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:34,400
And follow-up gangsters

2182
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,848
4shared

2183
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
You shouldn't admit that

2184
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,928
If you are

2185
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:02,304
There comes a point

2186
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:10,240
The New World Order

2187
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:17,664
I put my, why my family

2188
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
For sure I'll Never Compromise

2189
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:27,648
Never Say Never

2190
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,976
I'll Never Back Down

2191
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:36,096
Very ironic considering how much of a cheerleader

2192
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,424
Keep conceptualizes more ironic

2193
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,728
Considering he's had to back down from multiple stories

2194
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
The ID

2195
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:48,896
Everything is about the globalists in the New World Order

2196
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:52,480
Allows him to

2197
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,528
Do you know he's going to take out right now

2198
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,368
The Cowardly sound like

2199
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:04,256
No he's not done yet

2200
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,456
Federal

2201
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,736
Wannabe gangster

2202
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,576
Makes me want to throw up

2203
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
Disgaea

2204
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:55,456
Gross

2205
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
Once an hour

2206
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,728
Yeah but even though

2207
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:22,592
He had to find something to do as I got. Might as well plug

2208
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,176
Bring force is a roller

2209
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,760
Furious and then just the law

2210
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
Yeah

2211
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,112
The deflated after screaming yeah that's weird

2212
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,184
Obviously it's a combination of rainforest and his own

2213
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
Michelle wins

2214
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,864
August 4th

2215
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,912
But he does overdrive

2216
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,728
Which means that it's not on the regular radio

2217
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,520
Right

2218
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,824
Some stations that decide to cover it

2219
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,104
And on the internet

2220
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
Wards.com

2221
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,920
Fret

2222
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,200
Still on the brain

2223
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,992
Oh yeah

2224
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,272
Haha

2225
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
I think

2226
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,904
He is pretty glad that this isn't on the radio

2227
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,184
Once it starts

2228
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:13,280
I'm going to play you exactly where overdrive start

2229
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,608
And it will pick up probably the next hour

2230
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,936
Of Our Lives

2231
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:22,496
That is the most problematic thing

2232
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:27,104
I think I've ever heard on his show

2233
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:33,760
North Carolina thank you for calling thank you for holding your on the Year Frank welcome

2234
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:40,160
Give me a moment I promise tomorrow

2235
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:58,336
I heard you making some disparaging remarks the other day and praying that he was one of the most

2236
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,320
Where I'm coming from

2237
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:15,232
The whole system is lined up against white straight

2238
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:20,096
Traditional no

2239
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,008
At is the winning team

2240
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,824
Call Villa Capri

2241
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:36,224
Be on the winning team

2242
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
So

2243
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,600
Alex

2244
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
A white supremacist collar

2245
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,440
Yep

2246
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:50,304
Clearly on the consciously

2247
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,584
Or very much

2248
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
So

2249
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,264
I can't wait

2250
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,312
I mean he does

2251
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,408
We're in overdrive we have plenty of time as long as you want now

2252
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,432
I think

2253
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,992
Right before we get into this cuz it's rough

2254
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,552
What I think Alex Jones

2255
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
Think

2256
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,368
That his response to this

2257
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
Out

2258
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:16,416

That he is

2265
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,776

2266
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,336

2267
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,384

01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:41,248
Weird and because he's on the rainforest

2270
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,320
He mixes up a whole lot of other issues into it

2271
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,112
It's like I said

2272
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,392
Problematically

2273
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416

Well I'll be honest with you

2280
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,168
Organization

2281

01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:39,104
Dominate

2283
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,016
Basically

2284
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:52,416
Fra-dor or cover-up for Israel and all this bull

2285
01:50:56,256 --> 01:51:02,400
I don't blame Jews for it

2286
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:08,800
Some good Chinese

2287
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,176

All I know is

2298
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,728
Is it people want to feel like they're better than me

2299
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,008
Because they can say

2300
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,288

01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
His response

2306
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,856
To this caller saying

2310
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:40,704
Yeah that's kind of makes answer about this idea of what

2311
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,520
Of course there's a war on

2312
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,056
There's also a war black

2313
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:54,784

01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,328
And I don't like

2319
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,608
That you guys are folks

2320
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,632
On

2321
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,192
I don't like that you guys are focusing on this

2322
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,216
Race narrative

2323
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
That's what he say

2324
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,288
Someone

2325
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Like someone

2327
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,688
Plan to distract

2328
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,456
Against

2329
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,736
What they're doing

2330
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,552
And calling David Duke

2331
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,344
Or at least an agent

2332
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:34,208
Of the globalist subway

2333
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,744
You guys like get it

2334
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,792
You're just not right enough

2335
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:42,656
Right leg is everybody it's not just

2336
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,448
Which is good

2337
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,008
It's not guilty all lives matter

2338
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:50,592
Best Vet him all lives matter in white

2339
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:54,688
More or less the other thing is

2340
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,736
Alex Johnson

2341
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760

2342
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
How people hear him

2343
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,344
He doesn't realize

2344
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,368
How much

2345
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,416
White supremacist to love him

2346
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,464
He thinks how can he

2347
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:10,048
Well there's a small group that are very vocal that do things

2348
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,328
But he's a Zionist chill

2349
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,608
Stuff like that

2350
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:19,264
Like there are people who obviously sound off in his comments sections on

2351
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,544
His YouTube videos

2352
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
Better like you dumb

2354
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,688
These

2355
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,736
Small subsection

2356
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,272
Of the white supremacist

2357
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,296
Commenters

2358
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:34,624
That that respond to him as being like

2359
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:38,208
Not realizing that the narratives and the way he

2360
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,256
Culver's race differently

2361
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,280
Throughout the show

2362
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,816
Let you know the difference

2363
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,608
Potato white gunman in a black gun

2364
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,936
Or the way he's so Auntie Islam

2365
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:52,288
Doesn't realize our Manna From Heaven

Two white

2367
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:57,408
So he doesn't realize that

2368
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,992
This caller is essentially in his demographic

2369
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,808
Squarely in his demographic

2370
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:08,928
He's been listening for an hour

2371
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:11,744
Isn't saying Alex

2372
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:18,144
You're wrong I hate you you work for Israel and I don't like

2373
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:23,008

01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,784
Yeah well obviously they are

2377
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:39,648
And there are much like the situation with the police in Rockwall

2378
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,952
There's two possible for situation

2379
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,512
What is the totally oblivious

2380
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,560
Of the fact that he's a racist

2381
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,096
Which ICS

2382
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,120
Very unlikely

2383
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:51,936
Man

01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704

01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
Surprised by

2387
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
White supremacist loving him

2388
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,616
Estranged

2389
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,384
12

2390
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,920
His his defense

2391
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,968
To be that he says

2392
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,016
I don't care

2393
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,112
He says we all bleed red

2394
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
But

2395
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:11,904
You do care

2396
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Clearly

2397
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,208
Because

2398
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,232
Of what you say

2399
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,304
End

01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,608
All of your ex

Actions are racist

2402
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,168
You don't get to say

2403
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
So you know

2404
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:25,984
It his entire life is

2405
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:29,824

01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,616
Like that

2407
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,944
I don't care if you're white or black

2408
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,296
We have races on both sides

2409
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:43,648
There a lot of people on both sides but black people beat me up

2410
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:49,024
Your black butt

What's a hamburger

2446
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,720
Florida

2447
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:57,792
Forget I go through my life a little bit further and I

2448
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:01,376
Encounter Hispanic culture

2449
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,448
Now I've been validated my own white culture

2450
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,752
Because their culture is superior

2451
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:09,056
In terms of burrito versus hamburger

2452
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:13,664
Okay little bit further and then I run into like stir fry

2453
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,712
But I run into a Thai Cuisine

2454
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,016
Burritos

2455
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,088
That eventually becomes

2456
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,904
I think that's as dumb as what he saying

2457
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:28,256
Nike okay I was saying was very dumb

2458
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,048
She does make

2459
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,840
But no it doesn't make sense

2460
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,376
In the way there

2461
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,912
You mean it but

2462
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,960
As an explanation for how they say

2463
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
That does make

2464
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:44,896
The first step

2465
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
This one

2466
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,992
That one of them has to be better

2467
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,528
Yeah

2468
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,552
Like it's not

2469
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:53,344
Like you and I both know

2470
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,160
Some days I want to hand

2471
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
Sure

2472
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,512
So

2473
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
If you

2474
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,328
Always live in this like

2475
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
How to be the best

2476
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:13,312
So if so is better

2477
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
UCare

2478
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:19,456
Because that would as you said that would invalidate your

2479
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,992
Culture veneers Alex Azar

2480
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:28,416
Look you guys are being distracted by hamburger vs. burrito when the reality is there is a bunch of globalist elite

2481
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,696
You want us all to eat bush

2482
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
That's sort of his

2483
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,816
If you want to use a food metaphors

2484
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:39,168
He's getting a burrito fight against becoming bush

2485
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,216
Kind of makes

2486
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,568
Absolutely.

2487
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:50,944
I wish I could find an episode where Alex Jones finds out that like that guy was developing Soylent

2488
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,736
Like a food replacement

2489
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:55,808
Oh yeah I would love to hear your take on that

2490
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,440
Keeps

2491
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,512
Get more into this

2492
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,280
Which

2493
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,304
Batumi

2494
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,376
Kind of a little calculated

2495
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,400
Early

2496
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,680
Something that he got

2497
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,704
Which is that

2498
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
I get

2499
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,752
To have it both ways

2500
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:17,056
I get to let this white supremacist

2501
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,080
Stay the stuff

2502
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,360
That my listeners love

2503
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
And I get to

2504
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:22,944
Like I am against

2505
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,832
Somewhat yeah

2506
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,856
This version

2507
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,392
I look like a hero

2508
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:37,280
Sort of provide like the idea of eating myself

2509
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,400
Like I said there's a lot of call last

2510
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
Let's Dive In

2511
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:49,056
This one I just left I didn't really cut out all that much

2512
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:51,360
I cut out a couple things workout repetitive or

2513
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,176
I would have you just a couple of minutes of the

2514
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,992
Of the call this one start with h

2515
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,016
Coming back from break

2516
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:00,576
You lies about how he calls out all sorts of race

2517
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,856
No matter where it is

2518
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,672
False equivalence

2519
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:11,328
Organized and persecute

2520
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:31,808
Tribalism a private property

2521
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:35,648
The power of the family

2522
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:41,792
And yes whites are under attack yes they have free slaps for whites Berkeley

2523
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:45,888
Yes they're telling

2524
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:48,448
Bad and Evil

2525
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:52,032
Break right there tell you a little bit about my childhood

2526
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:55,104
I grew up in Hawaii for a little bit when I was

2527
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,152
And they call

2528
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:58,432
White people howling

2529
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,456
In Hawaii

2530
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,528
The translates to no soul

2531
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:04,576
White people don't have souls

2532
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:08,928
2

2533
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:15,328
There is a fairly Rich tradition of distrust of white people in Hawaii

2534
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,864
God still not enough

2535
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,912
The reasons only they have gotten it at

2536
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,984
Overthrowing of their government

2537
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:24,032
Taking of their land dance

2538
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,312
Complete destruction of

2539
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,896
There is a reason for that

2540
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,688
Even despite

2541
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:33,760
When I was growing up a lot of my friends were Hawaiian

2542
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,528
They were Native

2543
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,832
A lot of Polynesians

2544
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,856
It's where my friends growing

2545
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,904
There wasn't racism against

2546
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,672
Mia

2547
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,208
Although

2548
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,000
The calling people

2549
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:45,536
Was intrinsically racist

2550
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
Right

2551
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,584
So

2552
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,912
What I'm trying to get at is

2553
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,704
If I wanted to

2554
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:56,800
I could get up on a soapbox and talk about how racist everyone was to music

2555
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,080
I could do that

2556
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:01,152
I could say everyone called me and no Soul Heaven

2557
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920
White guy

2558
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:02,944
Broaden

2559
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,224
Right

2560
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:09,344
In the same way that Alex drive to get all kinds of white victimhood narratives out of nothing

2561
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,880
Get blood out of a stone

2562
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,440
I could do that same thing if I wanted

2563
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,256
With it with my childhood in Hawaii

2564
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:18,304
But the reality of it is

2565
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,608
I did get beat up once but I had to come in

2566
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:26,496
I was being a dick head to somebody and I could frame it as this big

2567
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:31,616
Reality is I would with a smartass kid and I was making fun of him

2568
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:37,504
I could reframe it if I want it

2569
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:41,088
I can leave out those details that no one would be able to find

2570
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:44,672
No one except maybe my brother you might be aware of it

2571
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:45,696
It's it's

2572
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,488
It's silly it's pointless

2573
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,280
I don't think

2574
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,376
I don't think the Texas could possibly be

2575
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,936
A more anti-white environment than Hawaii

2576
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:56,960
Like

2577
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,264
Hawaii has

2578
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:02,336
Hawaii has a very

2579
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,128
Morepro white that maybe

2580
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
Maybe Frank in North Carolina

2581
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,480
Dragon North Carolina's houses

2582
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:10,528
The very Pro white space

2583
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:12,320
But what I'm saying is this

2584
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:13,856
I think

2585
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:15,136
Hawaii has AIDS

2586
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,464
Cultural reason to be against

2587
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,280
It's very simple

2588
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,560
The cultural reasons

2589
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:25,120
You're there

2590
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:27,168
Do you know how you got there

2591
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,704
Not good

2592
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,728
You stole it

2593
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
You stole shed

2594
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
No

2595
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:32,800
YouTube

2596
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:36,128
At no point in history should anybody's trust white people

2597
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:38,432
No like the biggest change in his

2598
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,736
Three would be if you just sent one guy back ever

2599
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,760
Every time to be like a

2600
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,808
Don't don't say hi to the white people

2601
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:56,608
No I don't think there's a way to go back in time

2602
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:03,264
There's not but if there was a way to go back in time I think there's a way to still allow people in

2603
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,824
And be like don't trust their intention

2604
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,848
Like

2605
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:11,200
BB more hard-line negotiator about stuff

2606
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:14,272
Do not have souls don't give the benefit of the doubt

2607
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:16,320
I don't know if it's necessary

2608
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,344
For me to make this

2609
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,000
The first thing that he said

2610
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,792
In the clip is

2611
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:28,096
When right when white people are racist

2612
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:28,864
Listen to all this s***

2613
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,888
We call it out

2614
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:36,544
If they're you know if they're being set up

2615
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:41,408
If we're covered with we're going to call

2616
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
People are racist

2617
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,456
We will condemn it

2618
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,504
But every time we've seen wipe

2619
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,272
People be racist

2620
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,040
It's a false

2621
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,856
Yep

2622
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,880
They're set up to

2623
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,672
Distinct

2624
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:54,208
Between

2625
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,232
Frank

2626
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,256
Really dumb

2627
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,792
White supremacy

2628
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:58,816
And Alex is

2629
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:02,912
Cloaked white supremacy under the guise of globalist

2630
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:06,240
For the life of me cuz I've never spoke

2631
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,800
I don't really know if it's

2632
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,824
Intentional or not

2633
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:14,176
Like I don't know if Alex really deeply has white supremacist beliefs

2634
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:16,224
Or if it's just a byproduct

2635
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,504
Nick

2636
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,808
With underlying racism

2637
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:23,904
His kind of subconscious I don't know and I don't think we can though

2638
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,952
But this phone call is really

2639
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:29,536
This is going on

2640
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,584
This is unfolding

2641
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:35,680
But then

2642
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,728
The basically pigeonhole

2643
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:41,312
And go after

2644
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,152
Black people look at Gardasil

2645
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,016
Which is known to cause reproductive problems and all sorts of other

2646
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:52,832
Major major issues

2647
02:07:55,392 --> 02:08:00,256
That's being targeted against basically American countries

2648
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,304
Mexico is

2649
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,840
HP4 monster

2650
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:18,432
When you look at what larraza means it means the rice

2651
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,856
It's okay

2652
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,904
4S Ranch

2653
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:31,232
Manipulative it's all bad

2654
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
No it's not and you're lying

2655
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,048
What is

2656
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,096
The reality behind

2657
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:38,400
Bourassa translates to the people

2658
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:42,496
It doesn't Translate

2659
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,032
Version It's a false cognates

2660
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:47,616
It is like

2661
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
Erase

2662
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:49,920
Based organization

2663
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,968
Silly it's mostly cultural base

2664
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,528
Pictures is itself

2665
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,344
Just an advocacy group for Hispanic

2666
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,392
Right it's a group

2667
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
62

2668
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,952
Equalize

2669
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
Healthcare

2670
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,768
Education

2671
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:11,680
They seek to do good which means I have to

2672
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:15,008
Destroyed in the same way that like the n-double-acp will step in

2673
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,288
First civil rights

2674
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,312
Complaints

2675
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:20,128
Black people

2676
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,920
La Raza is there interim

2677
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,712
Hispanic

2678
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,504
Malbec

2679
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,040
Is a youth

2680
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:27,808
Organization

2681
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
The college organization

2682
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
It started back in

2683
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:34,208
It has a little bit more of a revolutionary bent to it

2684
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:35,744
I bought it

2685
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,024
Not at all

2686
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,048
Like

2687
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:38,816
The clan

2688
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:43,680
They do have their ways of the catchphrase

2689
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:46,240
Not sure if it's their official slogan

2690
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:50,080
Where are Delarosa nada

2691
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:52,640
Which means for the people everything

2692
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:54,432
For those against the people nothing

2693
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:56,224
It is

2694
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:56,992
Atake

2695
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:00,832
On the phrase that was popular during the Cuban Revolution

2696
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:03,136
Which was por la revolucion Toto

2697
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:05,952
Guerra de la revolucion de nada

2698
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Good

2699
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,488
Against it

2700
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,512
Essentially

2701
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,864
KK is stupid

2702
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
Because

2703
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,912
Even

2704
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
Even matchup

2705
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:21,056
Which does have a little bit more of a problematic history because

2706
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,336
It's mostly made up of

2707
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,360
For college students

2708
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,896
And sometimes they do dumb f***

2709
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Can things

2710
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:28,992
So there is a little bit worse than history to that but

2711
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:29,760
Not on

2712
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,040
Not on the scale of

2713
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,576
Okkk

2714
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,856
They just have

2715
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,648
Maybe said some bad stuff about Jews

2716
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,952
In the back

2717
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:40,768
No answer but I really like their restraint

2718
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,072
In there not murdering

2719
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,608
And killing a bunch

2720
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:50,752
Not targeting huge fan of the violin

2721
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,288
Didn't murder a bunch

2722
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,312
Two people for no other

2723
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,384
Add LaRosa is itself like I said

2724
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
The organization

2725
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,176
I do not

2726
02:10:58,688 --> 02:10:59,200
Against

2727
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:00,224
Anybody as much as

2728
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,016
You help people rent

2729
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:05,088
That's the thing that that's saying that n-double-acp

2730
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,112
Is the

2731
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:06,880
Black cuckoo

2732
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:09,952
Right

2733
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:12,768
This might be me giving Alex too much credit but there are some

2734
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:14,048
Streetgangs

2735
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,584
Something

2736
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,352
La Raza

2737
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,936
He's trying to make that false equivalence

2738
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:23,520
The reality is to

2739
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:29,664
It's so much more of a complicated conversation to have about the reason why organizations like the n-double-acp

2740
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,944
Hanna rosin

2741
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,712
Exist

2742
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:33,760
Something like

2743
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:39,136
Partly because of the f****** ku-klux yeah it's something like a white version of that

2744
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,672
Doesn't really need to exist

2745
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:42,720
Because if we got the Ku Klux Klan

2746
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:45,024
And and a lot of our interest

2747
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,048
We don't

2748
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,352
White interest

2749
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,632
Are protected by.

2750
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,400
Default

2751
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,168
And Society

2752
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:52,448
That is

2753
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:53,984
The standard of every

2754
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:57,824
And the reason why these groups needs to exist is sometime

2755
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,408
The priorities of people that just automatically get fulfilled

2756
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,968
I'd step on the toes of the

2757
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:08,576
Culturally disenfranchised group

2758
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,720
That is definitely more fair

2759
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Pretend

2760
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:21,120
Cultural Matrix of power doesn't spray

2761
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,912
Is absolutely insane

2762
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,936
But

2763
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:28,800
Why don't we have a history

2764
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:31,360
Because all all hit all of all of them

2765
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:32,896
So just shut up

2766
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:36,224
If we had a white history

2767
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,504
No one would care

2768
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,040
Shut up

2769
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:44,416
So Alex wants to make another time to explain

2770
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:47,232
Like his idea about the divide-and-conquer strategy

2771
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:50,304
Using against us by race

2772
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,864
The other way to explain it.

2773
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,912
Pictures of prisms

2774
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,704
In divide and conquer

2775
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:04,640
They organized it around race

2776
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:14,624
Eugenics

2777
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,768
I was a guest on the radio show one time

2778
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:32,800
I'm invited, for our discussion

2779
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:34,336
A few weeks ago

2780
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:37,664
And have a serious discussion about world events

2781
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:40,736
How does the square eugenics

2782
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:45,088
All these programs are going on

2783
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:47,648
It was just a conspiracy against white people

2784
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,352
Light

2785
02:13:59,424 --> 02:13:59,936
In the Gardasil

2786
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,264
I know it's giving it to the Alder Lake

2787
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:06,592
Mystics about

2788
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:11,456
Gardasil statistics about the incidence of side effects from Gardasil

2789
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:14,784
There is a database

2790
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:15,808
Negative

2791
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,576
Reactions

2792
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,112
The people have had behind

2793
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,440
To Gardasil like everybody gets

2794
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
What do you mean

2795
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,352
So everybody

2796
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,632
So there's a hundred percent

2797
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,912
Murder rate

2798
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:33,216
Call them

2799
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:36,288
You get all of them every time in the database

2800
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:40,896
Investigated the claims

2801
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
These incidents

2802
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:46,272
You know you just get rid of fever

2803
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,808
And stuff like that

2804
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:50,112
Fevers headache

2805
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,160
Stuff like that

2806
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,952
9 to 1/200

2807
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:55,744
Landscape

2808
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,536
You get to serious side effects

2809
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:00,096
And people went through Port over

2810
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:01,888
20000 incidents

2811
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,216
Negative side effects of people who got these

2812
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,240
Vaccine

2813
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,520
Right

2814
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,800
Conclusion

2815
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,568
Is

2816
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:12,384
That could analyze

2817
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:15,712
There is nothing that suggests that there's causation

2818
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,760
From the Gardasil vaccine at all

2819
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:19,040
The numbers were

2820
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:20,064
Statistically

2821
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:20,832
On

2822
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:22,112
Interesting

2823
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,928
When a 2d just population

2824
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,488
The deaths that have happened because of Gardasil

2825
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,560
Are not things that could be attributed to Gardasil

2826
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,584
The side effects

2827
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,376
Correlation causes

2828
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:35,936
Beside effect that are very serious

2829
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:38,496
Are things that like I said are just

2830
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:41,056
Statistically on par with a population

2831
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:45,920
So they did a little further Deep dive into side effects of vaccines

2832
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,456
I want thing

2833
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:50,272
That was really interesting but this guy

2834
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:52,064
Was that if you take

2835
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,600
These five specific vaccine

2836
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:59,232
And the other ones

2837
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:00,256
The incident

2838
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:03,328
Reported of cervical dysplasia

2839
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,376
In people who have had these vaccines

2840
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:07,168
You look at it

2841
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,472
The people who had the vaccine

2842
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:10,496
Two people

2843
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Had cervical

2844
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,032
Dysplasia

2845
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:12,800
Three of them

2846
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:14,848
0 one of them had one

2847
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,128
Those numbers are

2848
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,408
Stanford we lower

2849
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:19,968
Then the main population as a whole

2850
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:21,760
Now maybe they also cure

2851
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:24,320
Well you can't make that claim either

2852
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:27,136
Correlation not causation

2853
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,160
Interesting

2854
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,696
Statistically and

2855
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:33,024
Saying that the flu vaccine cure cervical dysplasia

2856
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,584
Have the same amount of scientific credibility

2857
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,352
Did Alex

2858
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:41,984
So the idea that like fluoride isn't nearly

2859
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,008
Negative is Alex

2860
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:45,056
It's I don't think

2861
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:46,592
It's great put anything in the water

2862
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:51,200
It's not some sort of brain chemical

2863
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,736
That part is a huge man

2864
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,808
Further is other example

2865
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:58,880
That they're forcing Gardasil on people and no one's mad about it

2866
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,000
Tens of thousands of women die every year globally because of cervical cancer

2867
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
If you look at this

2868
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,560
Statistical rate

2869
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:08,608
Negative side effects

2870
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:12,192
Deaths caused by Wichita

2871
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,752
At least

2872
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:19,104
Not negligible number Medical Science

2873
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:23,712
But compared to the tens of thousands

2874
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:25,504
Not to mention anal cancers

2875
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,832
Not to mention there's like four or five other cancers that takes care of

2876
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:32,160
Hbv causes

2877
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,184
Bunch of cancers

2878
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:35,232
You can just get rid of it

2879
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:39,072
It's insane that he's against it and thinks it's a

2880
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:40,608
Some sort of a scam

2881
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,680
Because it's

2882
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,704
For women

2883
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,752
Liberty also knows that

2884
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,544
80% of his listeners are food

2885
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
Who cares

2886
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,152
Do the other thing I wanted to point out what about that clip was

2887
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:54,944
His premise of

2888
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,272
Prisons are run by separating people by race

2889
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,368
Warden

2890
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,392
Control the

2891
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:07,488
Play them off against each other

2892
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,304
Games based on race

2893
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:13,376
Documentaries about prison

2894
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:17,728
No one's doing that to them everyone does that to themselves

2895
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,776
People separate based on race

2896
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,824
In prison because

2897
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,616
It's a desperate situation

2898
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,664
There are a lot of criminals in

2899
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,200
Yeah there's a lot of it

2900
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,224
Exploiters in there

2901
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:31,040
There's a lot of people who have created a system

2902
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,344
If you're weak

2903
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,880
They will rape you

2904
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:35,904
If you're weak

2905
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,952
They will take all of your food

2906
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:38,720
Your week

2907
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,000
They will get you

2908
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:41,280
To have your parents

2909
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,048
Send money

2910
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:46,656
There's so much methods of exploitation the people use in prison

2911
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:49,728
Not to mention right so the fish

2912
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,496
Is

2913
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,520
The system

2914
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,288
The inmates

2915
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,824
Have been able to figure out which is

2916
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,616
Definitely flawed

2917
02:18:56,128 --> 02:19:01,248
A big part of that might be

2918
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:04,320
Little lot of these criminals

2919
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:08,416
A lot of gangs on the outside

2920
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:12,256
Translate

2921
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:14,560
Who is Emily of the global

2922
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,584
Weston acai

2923
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,144
In this metaphor

2924
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,448
The fight then we'll have total control over the prison

2925
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:25,312
With those games

2926
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,480
So stupid

2927
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,016
His metaphor doesn't work

2928
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,064
It's a dumb metaphor

2929
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,112
Yasso

2930
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,160
It's a little bit weird about people

2931
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:40,928
Thinking he's Jewish

2932
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:42,976
There's something bigger here

2933
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,280
It's much worse

2934
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,560
Limited

2935
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:54,752
Is there Jewish

2936
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,544
Absolutely

2937
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:00,896
What does it mean

2938
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:07,552
Individual Jews themselves were very diverse people

2939
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:15,232
It's more complex laws in Israel

2940
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:20,608
Is that a yes

2941
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:22,144
Why does this real promote

2942
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,960
Rachel stabbed over here but that doesn't live by there

2943
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:31,872
Greenville Walmart

2944
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:38,272
They are back

2945
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:40,064
About me

2946
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,112
Orders from Israel

2947
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,904
You complained

2948
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,976
Really seem to be mostly about

2949
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:49,792
The problem with the KKK

2950
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,840
Sometimes they're mad at me

2951
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:56,192
Everything else

2952
02:20:56,704 --> 02:21:00,032
And then we'll find some legal officer Corporation

2953
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:07,968
Lawyers

2954
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:09,760
Alcohol

2955
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:14,880
And so I must work.

2956
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,976
Liquor license for liquor store

2957
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:28,960
Losing something that isn't there

2958
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:34,848
Shroud

2959
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:46,368
Persons issue

2960
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
I don't like the way you say

2961
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:56,352
From Wales

2962
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:59,424
Alex Jones's are walking around

2963
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:08,896
You think you gained some point on me

2964
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:17,088
Okay

2965
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,624
By yourself

2966
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:30,144
Sakura whales

2967
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:34,240
Wow

2968
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:38,592
F***** up I tried I listen to that like three times and I really tried to parse

2969
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:40,384
Exactly what he's saying

2970
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,432
About being called a Jew

2971
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:49,088
Put a nail in it I don't know I have no idea what he saying

2972
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:50,624
I don't know what he's mad about

2973
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,392
I think

2974
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:56,256
I think

2975
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:58,048
Chill

2976
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:59,584
Either line

2977
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,864
Frank didn't say

2978
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:02,656
He's responding

2979
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,680
2

2980
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,960
Criticism of David

2981
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,752
I am

2982
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:10,848
You know things that people put on his message boards comments but he gets the

2983
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:12,128
Heat

2984
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,712
Frank is calling to talk about Alex

2985
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,760
Mischaracterizing David Duke

2986
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:20,320
And the two of them seem to have cinnamon

2987
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:22,112
Of course

2988
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:23,136
Alex

2989
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:26,976
Some people in the white supremacist movement

2990
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,000
Called him a Jew

2991
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:29,024
Now

2992
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,560
Consider

2993
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:34,656
Consider that brainforce is sold as a focus

2994
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:37,216
And attention supplement

2995
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:41,312
This is a this is a commercial against rainforest

2996
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:47,712
But also I don't like you were saying that you don't like how he says and I agree

2997
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:50,784
Not a good way then also the thing is

2998
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:57,440
No matter what he's saying about people trying to score points on him by accusing him of being Jewish

2999
02:23:57,696 --> 02:24:00,768
Playing into the game of being called a Jew is negative

3000
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,304
True

3001
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,608
That's not exactly

3002
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:07,424
I I didn't

3003
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,752
Because I assumed that like it's so ridiculous

3004
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,824
Being called a Jew would matter

3005
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:18,176
So of course that doesn't even cross my brain

3006
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,456
In his world though

3007
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,224
That is

3008
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:22,272
They are

3009
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:26,880
It's very very weird

3010
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,416
Not because they're

3011
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,440
Because

3012
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,464
Oh man

3013
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:33,280
Very weird

3014
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,816
The call is not done

3015
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:42,240
Back on the line

3016
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,520
And what he does

3017
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:47,104
He had sides to hip Alex up on a little bit of new lingo

3018
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,640
Oh that's going on

3019
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:52,224
Is the Galaxy ever hear about this

3020
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:57,856
B the beginning of some of the the seeds of the alt-right rise that we have seen

3021
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:14,496
Two things

3022
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,544
Nixon in that context

3023
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:17,312
He was like

3024
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:19,616
Ally

3025
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,944
But then also

3026
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,736
But then the other thing is

3027
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:26,272
You like these black racist

3028
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:28,576
White racist

3029
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:30,880
Has been stolen from them

3030
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:32,672
U-Haul

3031
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:36,512
Body of products that you sell is based on the globalist

3032
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:38,304
Feeling Your vitality

3033
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,096
You are the worst

3034
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:44,448
If the problem is it's right

3035
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:45,984
It's not global

3036
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:52,384
The globalist of taking our sovereignty they've taken our Vitality through the water

3037
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,664
Take me to Waverly

3038
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,480
Angle of attack

3039
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,272
Is incredibly silly

3040
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,064
Like that is complained about races

3041
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,600
Anyway

3042
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:03,904
There's my rent on that subject

3043
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:09,792
Frank

3044
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:12,608
He's better than you friend maybe I should get some of the

3045
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,752
Worship

3046
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:22,848
Cuz she wasn't that

3047
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:30,528
Because there's a bus in Canada

3048
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:38,720
Culture overwritten in before

3049
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,632
That's your right arm stand review

3050
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:57,408
The globalist want to tear each other's throats and we don't need that on the

3051
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:05,344
Yeah I think that's a really good idea to have to think it would make for great radio if nothing else

3052
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,904
I don't think he's a white supremacist

3053
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,824
There's a lot of people out there that probably did 30-40 years ago or maybe after

3054
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:33,760
Not at all

3055
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:40,416
Either way

3056
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:44,512
Stand up for themselves and then stopped

3057
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:54,752
Directions

3058
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:03,456
Just a reality white men or have to stand up for themselves

3059
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,296
Yeah this is this is dark

3060
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:11,392
Alex is not repudiating really any of the things

3061
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:17,024
Not with everything other than the

3062
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,888
Stand up for themselves

3063
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:22,912
But against the global

3064
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,216
God

3065
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:28,288
If you say race-traitor

3066
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:31,872
Yeah

3067
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,272
Gazette

3068
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:41,856
Again that implies B race

3069
02:28:42,112 --> 02:28:42,624
Is a

3070
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:47,488
No don't reply

3071
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,768
It does

3072
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,304
White people are all in this

3073
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,072
Together

3074
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,608
Instead of people

3075
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:55,936
Countries

3076
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:59,520
Cupboard

3077
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:02,336
Cuz I was born with this skin color

3078
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,616
Means that

3079
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,408
I have to follow along with

3080
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,200
Like Bandits the best

3081
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:08,224
Skin color

3082
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:11,808
Yeah how arbitrary is that for bigotry

3083
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:16,928
It's Billy to take a step back and look at it like f****** stupid

3084
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:18,976
It's mind-boggling

3085
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:21,280
To really to really like

3086
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:22,560
Get into your head and just think

3087
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,584
You know what

3088
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,632
I bet it's skin color

3089
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,936
I bet that's what does it

3090
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:33,824
Well the problem with modern racism is that there's such a deep history of debunked

3091
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:36,896
Scientific theories around

3092
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:39,968
That a lot of people who don't really want very smart

3093
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:41,248
Might have

3094
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:48,160
Some beliefs that date back to like phrenology like that and I think it's really smart versions of

3095
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:49,952
Not all black IQs are way lower

3096
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:52,256
And stuff like that smaller brains

3097
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:53,536
S*** like that

3098
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,304
So

3099
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:59,168
If somebody says a problem

3100
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:01,728
From people just deal with the reality that it is

3101
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:03,776
This is based on Aesthetics

3102
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:04,800
Yeah

3103
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:06,848
You hate you hate people who look

3104
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:08,128
Just say that

3105
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:11,200
Your tribal fuc

3106
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,040
No you see it's fast

3107
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:15,808
Muscle fiber

3108
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,112
That's why black people are better at basketball

3109
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:18,880
Likenow f*** you

3110
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:19,648
You're an

3111
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:26,560
Yeesh one more clip in this call and then we will move on to greener pastures for a minute

3112
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:33,216
White supremacist proud just says the same stuff over and over again

3113
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,080
I understand what you're saying

3114
02:30:38,592 --> 02:30:39,360
It's just that

3115
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,432
I'm not a traitor to life

3116
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:45,504
And the globalist conquer

3117
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,784
And control

3118
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:49,856
And I think somebody should expose the masterplan

3119
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:51,136
Does it mean

3120
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:52,928
Did you grow up

3121
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:57,536
Can you get attacked as a white person told your bad physically attacked

3122
02:30:57,792 --> 02:31:03,168
Doesn't mean you don't want to go

3123
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,216
Black people

3124
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:10,848
They're so close to each other

3125
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:12,640
But you jealous

3126
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,296
What

3127
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:23,648
Shoe Show close

3128
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:30,048
When it comes to

3129
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:31,072
Appreciate your call

3130
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,144
Appreciate your call talk about

3131
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:38,496
Beating or something it's not

3132
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:42,080
Explosion

3133
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:44,128
Rainforest

3134
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:46,176
Frustrated

3135
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,968
Is over

3136
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:49,504
But Alex is not done

3137
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:52,320
Could never have guessed that

3138
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:53,088
The next

3139
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:56,672
Clip here is his aftermath from this call

3140
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:58,720
He thinks

3141
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:00,256
These above racism

3142
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:05,120
I don't really know what his point is in this

3143
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:06,656
Doesn't sound good

3144
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:14,080
So many white supremacists comments on Infowars

3145
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:19,712
Would you really take a one-year-old black.

3146
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:21,760
No

3147
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:29,952
How do you hate Khalid Muhammad kill all the white babies

3148
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:35,584
Soul recoils from

3149
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:40,960
I don't need to read it the book or no it it'll actually know I do

3150
02:32:59,648 --> 02:33:02,976
Can you get that done

3151
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:06,048
And even worse

3152
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:12,448
I will not sit here and feel good about myself

3153
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,824
It's disgusting

3154
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:33,440
Racist blacks

3155
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,888
Guns

3156
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:49,312
Bunch of big black guy

3157
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:52,384
Because you're white

3158
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:56,480
Oh yeah

3159
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:58,784
You mean yesterday

3160
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:05,184
Tomorrow

3161
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:08,512
Suggest

3162
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:09,536
That says

3163
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:12,096
It doesn't happen

3164
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:14,656
No it doesn't have it it's gone the other direction

3165
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:18,752
Black people are oppressing white people

3166
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:21,568
Well but if you wants to just literally talked about

3167
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:22,592
Dunno black

3168
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:26,688
Folk you know we just have to do Castillo video come out

3169
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:29,504
It's a horrifying

3170
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,272
To know that that s***

3171
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:32,064
Carter

3172
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:38,208
If you look at just if you want to extrapolate further cuz I know that he doesn't like Muslims either

3173
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:42,048
There was that young girl who got kidnapped outside a mosque

3174
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:46,400
Beaten to death just recently just like last week or so

3175
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:49,216
They're saying it's not a hate crime it was a road rage

3176
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,568
Which is great

3177
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,592
Killed a fort

3178
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:57,920
13 year old Muslim girl road rage

3179
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:59,456
Wind up with you beating a

3180
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:00,736
A fourteen-year-old girl

3181
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:01,504
I don't know

3182
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,784
I don't know I don't know

3183
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,064
I don't know what kind of a f******

3184
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:09,184
Monster would burn down the other day

3185
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:13,024
The guy just got charged with it

3186
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:17,632
Somebody's went in wanted to find out if they're Mach with heavily-armed

3187
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,448
Bowers try and find guns

3188
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,240
Cuz they were convinced

3189
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:25,056
Fart

3190
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:28,640
Military centers and what have you

3191
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:33,248
In an arson

3192
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
Are cockamamie their nonsense

3193
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:40,160
Is really offensive racist in that last

3194
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,096
If you're racist are you willing to beat a 1 year old black baby to death

3195
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:50,656
Cuz that's what we're talking about that's not what we're talkin

3196
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:57,056
What about you don't have to do that to be one of the worst races possible all you have to do is deny that racism

3197
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,360
You have to live your life

3198
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:00,128
In such a

3199
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:02,432
In such a way as to deny the

3200
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:06,016
The validity of people who are expressing their reality

3201
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,344
PlayStation app

3202
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,112
Dawn

3203
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,904
Mary love them

3204
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:17,024
Like fantasy

3205
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,816
White dude fantasy

3206
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:20,864
I get to be

3207
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:21,632
Justified

3208
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:22,400
And killing somebody

3209
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:27,776
That's what they really want really want to be that guy with the gun they want to kill somebody

3210
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:30,080
That's what they

3211
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,616
That literally the

3212
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:35,456
Gold when I was like

3213
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:39,552
13

3214
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:45,952
It was I wanted to be in a righteous fight like I wanted to get into a fight like standing up for somebody

3215
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:52,352
Like I wanted to be in a place where I could just unload I was doing it because the other person was the

3216
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:55,168
And Alex has grown out of that

3217
02:36:55,424 --> 02:37:00,800
Sorry that took up a lot of time but it is important

3218
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:03,360
The overdrive is done

3219
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:08,224
He takes another call from somebody who explained to him that he's fulfilling biblical prophecy

3220
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,504
Which is not

3221
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,296
Alex

3222
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,576
Caller says that Alex

3223
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:15,648
Will really help out his f****** Jesus

3224
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:19,232
The complex music play almost like looking like he's going to cry

3225
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:27,168
Because Alex Jones has sources backing him up and he's not a liar like everyone else

3226
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:30,752
I would ask that guy to look at Alex's sources

3227
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:34,080
Oh that's I got to read the Bible to get back on his meds

3228
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,640
You get the call or towards the end

3229
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:38,176
What is overdrive

3230
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,320
On August 14th

3231
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:46,880
In the fourth hour of his three-hour show

3232
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:48,416
Call Lemon Grove

3233
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:58,144
Yeah Alex I'll try to be as quick as I can I just want to throw out some point so you can put a timer on me or whatever 2 minutes or whatever but

3234
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:03,520
Throw out some stuff for you

3235
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:07,360
Pilar country

3236
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,640
Has the

3237
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:10,688
X to the last

3238
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:16,832
Replace my best on rainfall

3239
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:18,112
221

3240
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,392
Versus

3241
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,672
On the roulette wheel

3242
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:25,536
Play some 101 bet on Trump trump has any character

3243
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:27,840
Okay and

3244
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:35,520
Spend our time and money on Races that we can win you know I mean in like you're saying other time but

3245
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:40,384
They say I think

3246
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:45,760
She's an outsider that's why people feel he's an outsider he's out of career politician

3247
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:52,928
Actually I feel he's an Insider he's actually an inside rather globulus to sabotage

3248
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,744
You think you understand

3249
02:38:56,512 --> 02:39:01,376
Far as that goes I wrote down a bunch of stuff I'm a little nervous.

3250
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,912
Listen you're probably right

3251
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:12,128
We'll see what he ends up doing

3252
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:15,712
Yeah

3253
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:23,392
Malleable be like that you know I mean

3254
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:26,464
Alex

3255
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:30,304
Scrooged

3256
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:33,120
Any casino owning

3257
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:36,960
And a big slumlord

3258
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:41,056
Economy

3259
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:46,176
But you have to defend them because what he's saying is true

3260
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,712
Office

3261
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:54,112
That's why it's catching on

3262
02:39:54,368 --> 02:40:00,512
The other candidates should be saying it as well just more smoothly as dumb

3263
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:06,912
Booksmart

3264
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,680
Shark

3265
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:09,472
Casino opening shark

3266
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:10,496
But you got them

3267
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:14,848
Ideas man those vaccines right

3268
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:19,200
We're going to be covering one more day

3269
02:40:19,456 --> 02:40:21,760
Okay

3270
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:22,784
Necessarily

3271
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,576
The Friday

3272
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,392
And

3273
02:40:27,648 --> 02:40:28,672
August

3274
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,696
16th comes around

3275
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:33,024
Mentioned in past episodes

3276
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:36,352
My experience is that Sundays are for

3277
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:39,424
Doing a trial balloon the new narrative

3278
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:42,496
The new narrative on Sunday

3279
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:44,544
And I'll just

3280
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:45,312
Of August

3281
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:46,336
16th 2050

3282
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:52,992
Call Geico

3283
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:58,368
About Donald Trump

3284
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:03,232
Because he is

3285
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:11,936
That are not what a scripted controlled candidate

3286
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:15,008
Machine irrevocable

3287
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:18,848
An absolutely massive scale

3288
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,760
Because he's support about parties in the past and

3289
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:27,552
Own casinos

3290
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:32,928
Has his own list of problems and has been part of WWE wrestling

3291
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:37,536
Jesse Ventura

3292
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:40,608
Long-term politicians like Donald Trump

3293
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:43,936
People think he's an outsider

3294
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:48,288
To certain point he's made his money though off the service economy

3295
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:52,128
Alpha products

3296
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:56,224
Stealing money

3297
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:58,016
Statement right there he

3298
02:41:58,272 --> 02:42:01,856
Contradicted his own Knowledge from past episodes that we've seen

3299
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:04,928
He has stated before he's a front man

3300
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:05,952
4 Consortium

3301
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,768
Doesn't make his money off

3302
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:10,048
Of service stuff

3303
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:13,376
No he doesn't make his money off the free market is part of the mob

3304
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:14,656
Alex

3305
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:16,448
Is

3306
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:17,472
Making his pivot

3307
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,008
This is the turn right

3308
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:22,080
Are we say is he

3309
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:24,128
Full-throated I don't think so

3310
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:27,712
What happened on the moon

3311
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:32,320
He's going to get to it a little bit in the in the next couple days

3312
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:33,088
Earlier

3313
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:33,856
Couple of days I would

3314
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:38,720
Eclipse cuz it'll sort of come out and then I will give you my sister

3315
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:44,864
I'm right here on air

3316
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,008
Wrong

3317
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:55,616
Bulshit

3318
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:56,896
All the time

3319
02:42:57,408 --> 02:43:03,552
Yeah that works

3320
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:06,624
SeaWorld

3321
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:15,072
This is written up prefab

3322
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:21,472
It is unscripted so there's mistakes but

3323
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:25,568
I rarely fundamentally Miss Gage

3324
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:29,408
Major geopolitical

3325
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:34,272
Because I've been doing this year's on air over 20

3326
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:39,904
And I've learned the players are the different clubs are the different Power structures are

3327
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:44,000
I didn't last 20 plus years it's been the same group of

3328
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:52,704
So you're not getting too much information there about

3329
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:55,520
Well he's just saying that he's never wrong

3330
02:43:55,776 --> 02:43:59,872
This person that ever was

3331
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,640
Enough

3332
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:02,176
Stand up and

3333
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,224
I got the date wrong

3334
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:06,016
Did that one time

3335
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:08,832
Even though that stuff is deflection area bulshit

3336
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,880
This is unlike Allen

3337
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:17,024
The idea is undoing all of this

3338
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:20,352
All the stuff he's been saying for the last 2 months

3339
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,400
Very weird

3340
02:44:23,168 --> 02:44:24,448
And it's very abrupt

3341
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:25,984
It is really abrupt

3342
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,008
Cuz the ended

3343
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:29,824
The 14th show which is Friday no show on Saturday

3344
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,640
Saying negative things about Trump

3345
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:37,248
Still giving him the benefit of the doubt he's a liar he's floors

3346
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:39,808
Even though like

3347
02:44:40,064 --> 02:44:42,880
The the trajectory that we've seen hasn't been

3348
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:43,904
Hasn't been

3349
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:46,208
Flat and then there was a change today

3350
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:49,280
There's been there's been some little motion of like

3351
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:53,632
I just he's a distraction and we don't even want to talk about I'm Turtle like

3352
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:56,192
Let me tell you he's a

3353
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:57,984
Yeah

3354
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,008
Well I like what

3355
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:04,640
What is this

3356
02:45:04,896 --> 02:45:06,944
The shell

3357
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:10,016
Or I know things about him

3358
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:17,952
We're going to get to the other statements

3359
02:45:18,464 --> 02:45:19,744
But first we got to pay the bill

3360
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:26,400
Got to do a little bit of a super male Vitality commercial products about

3361
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:29,984
A different people

3362
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:33,824
Is what happens in the morning when you wake up at 6 a.m.

3363
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:37,152
That job

3364
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:38,944
I was be honest

3365
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:41,504
I don't need Cialis or Viagra

3366
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:44,064
What is a man 41 years old

3367
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:50,464
Once the doctor had a checkup

3368
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:56,864
Anaya bottles about Cialis and Viagra used

3369
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,936
Recreational

3370
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:04,799
Either it's just

3371
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:14,015
Idea what it does for everything else

3372
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:18,111
They call the boner is a metaphor talkin about

3373
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:24,511
You going to have a mind boner killer is a metaphor

3374
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:27,071
Dropper

3375
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,351
Yeah we can put

3376
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:36,799
It's better for

3377
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:39,871
Somehow yeah

3378
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:40,639
From the woman

3379
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:42,431
Yeah

3380
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:46,527
This is the last Cliff I have his statement on Trump

3381
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:48,063
Where he's at on August

3382
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,111
16th and

3383
02:46:56,767 --> 02:47:01,119
I mean one of the pieces of our investigation is to like what are these things you sell

3384
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:02,655
And our long-term

3385
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:04,447
Contention

3386
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:05,727
To use the word properly

3387
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:07,007
That was our penultimate

3388
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:10,847
What

3389
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:12,383
Changed his mind a little bit

3390
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:14,943
By then we get on the other side of it all

3391
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:15,967
Romance

3392
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:28,767
Klitschko strongman

3393
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:33,631
Napoleon Bonaparte types

3394
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:36,447
William the Conqueror type

3395
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:40,543
I'd like to point out that within the last week of these episodes

3396
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:41,823
It's in the timeline

3397
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:48,223
Alex Jones is unfair unfavorably compared Donald Trump to Hitler

3398
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,783
Seizure types

3399
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,855
Would try to come in

3400
02:47:56,927 --> 02:48:01,279
But if you shut up other people in control of other power

3401
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
And that

3402
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:09,983
Because we have three centers of government

3403
02:48:12,287 --> 02:48:14,847
That would not allow a dictatorship

3404
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,151
How sad is it that in hindsight

3405
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:19,711
His analysis is right and why we're f*****

3406
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:26,111
In hindsight how sad is it that Alex Jones

3407
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:31,999
The only branch of government that is under the sway of 8D crazy out of control

3408
02:48:32,255 --> 02:48:32,767
Yep

3409
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:34,303
How

3410
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:35,071
Hey come on

3411
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:36,607
Don't forget

3412
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:38,655
They control the Supreme Court also

3413
02:48:39,167 --> 02:48:42,239
Nothing I control the still some issues with the a plays out

3414
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:47,615
If we're going to help us

3415
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:50,687
Rodger Stone

3416
02:48:50,943 --> 02:48:52,991
There's another Supreme Court

3417
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:57,087
Rodger Stone

3418
02:48:57,343 --> 02:48:59,903
Yeah that's what I like

3419
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:04,511
Alright

3420
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:13,983
Alphabet Corporation

3421
02:49:14,495 --> 02:49:17,055
But still attached

3422
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:20,383
McDonald's

3423
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:25,759
Money off having a rich economy

3424
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:28,831
Off people vacationing people

3425
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:33,695
Russian slang for salesman

3426
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:43,423
How much Freedom we lost in that we really nowhere in a Long Cold depression

3427
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:49,567
He speaks to that he should look our borders are wide open

3428
02:49:49,823 --> 02:49:53,919
For free

3429
02:49:57,503 --> 02:50:02,623
Not for you

3430
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:05,695
He'll come on somebody

3431
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:11,071
They thought it was a joke at first

3432
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:32,575
Double cross people are I tell you he is going to be

3433
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:39,999
He's going after the clintons now which is a big deal

3434
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:42,815
Wants to be president

3435
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:48,703
NFL leaders in history that weren't perfect

3436
02:50:50,495 --> 02:50:53,567
That's why I Like A Boss Hog management control

3437
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:55,359
Montag was not the hero

3438
02:50:56,127 --> 02:51:00,991
The Trump doesn't want

3439
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:03,039
He is a capital at the end of the day

3440
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:04,831
He's totally different then

3441
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:11,231
Barack Obama and a cloward-piven

3442
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:14,815
Executing

3443
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:17,631
He's got some major problems

3444
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:24,031
But it's nice

3445
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:27,615
This is Trump on Clinton emails

3446
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:29,663
Problem this is bull

3447
02:51:34,015 --> 02:51:39,391
Because

3448
02:51:39,903 --> 02:51:41,183
This will destroy you

3449
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:48,863
Because it'll make it safe for other people to do it

3450
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:55,263
This is a general election problem

3451
02:51:55,519 --> 02:52:01,663
No problem

3452
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:08,063
Proverbs 22:28

3453
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:27,263
Gmail

3454
02:52:37,247 --> 02:52:38,015
So that's what happened

3455
02:52:39,807 --> 02:52:42,367
Trump said a couple negative things about Hillary Clinton

3456
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:43,903
Trump

3457
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:44,671
That's it

3458
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:45,951
Wanted to jail Hill

3459
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:47,487
That's pretty much it

3460
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:48,255
That's it

3461
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:49,791
Let the big thing

3462
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:51,071
That's what

3463
02:52:51,327 --> 02:52:53,119
That's what happened over the weekend

3464
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:58,239
Yeah but that's all that's all Alex needed was somebody to come out and say let's put Hillary

3465
02:52:59,007 --> 02:52:59,775
Basically

3466
02:53:01,055 --> 02:53:03,103
But I actually think it's much bigger than that

3467
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:04,383
What you would have to

3468
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:06,687
Well I think

3469
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:11,807
It turns out our theories are both kind of correct cuz this is very close after the first of

3470
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:14,879
Get him

3471
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:16,415
On board with Trump

3472
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:17,951
But it opened the door

3473
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:19,487
And

3474
02:53:19,743 --> 02:53:23,839
I don't have I don't have the exact audio of it but even on this episode

3475
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:25,119
I'm not endorsing him

3476
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:29,215
That he is a serious

3477
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:29,983
You spoken out of

3478
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:31,007
Against Clinton

3479
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:33,311
Fully on board

3480
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:35,103
I know what's going to happen

3481
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:36,895
The thought the thought that

3482
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:38,943
He was having the reason that he was

3483
02:53:39,199 --> 02:53:39,711
Holding back

3484
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:41,503
Was because he thought

3485
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,527
That

3486
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:44,831
The real the real reason was because he

3487
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:45,599
He thought that

3488
02:53:45,855 --> 02:53:46,623
Trump was owned by the

3489
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:47,647
Yeah

3490
02:53:47,903 --> 02:53:48,415
Now

3491
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:49,183
That

3492
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:49,951
He knows

3493
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:51,487
To put Hillary

3494
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:52,767
Jail

3495
02:53:53,023 --> 02:53:56,095
Exactly

3496
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:57,375
No nobody

3497
02:53:57,631 --> 02:53:58,143
Well

3498
02:53:58,655 --> 02:53:59,167
I mean maybe

3499
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:04,287
But so so bye-bye getting rid of that

3500
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:06,335
All of his other objections

3501
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:07,103
Bulshit

3502
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,127
They work though

3503
02:54:08,383 --> 02:54:09,407
I mean

3504
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:12,479
Well they were just

3505
02:54:12,735 --> 02:54:15,551
They don't matter as much as how much he hates Hillary

3506
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:17,599
Exactly he hates her so much

3507
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:22,207
But the thing is

3508
02:54:23,231 --> 02:54:23,743
Internalized

3509
02:54:23,999 --> 02:54:24,511
Massage

3510
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:26,303
Like

3511
02:54:28,095 --> 02:54:28,607
Externalize

3512
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:30,655
Well it certainly comes out

3513
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:31,679
But

3514
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:38,335
I know I know exactly what's going to happen

3515
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:45,503
Like he's okay with the idea that Trump may lead us fascism

3516
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:48,319
Because he hates Hillary Clinton

3517
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:51,135
I would actually stated that was

3518
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:55,231
Dirt during the race I think most Republicans would have agreed with

3519
02:54:55,487 --> 02:55:01,631
I'd rather have fascism been a woman president

3520
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:05,471
Exactly

3521
02:55:06,495 --> 02:55:09,567
Like I can predict 100% what's going to happen

3522
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:11,615
Cuz Alex is now open

3523
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:12,383
The door

3524
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:13,919
Then the door is

3525
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:19,295
The door was being held shut by his concern that Trump was a shell

3526
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:20,063
Ford

3527
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:22,367
Right that's specific fear

3528
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:24,927
That he's just there to torpedo Rand Paul

3529
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:25,695
Right

3530
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:31,327
Publicly done this trial balloon on this Sunday show

3531
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:33,375
What's going to happen

3532
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:38,239
Now that Rodger Stone isn't part of the campaign

3533
02:55:38,751 --> 02:55:39,775
He's going to show up

3534
02:55:40,543 --> 02:55:41,567
Kick that door wide open

3535
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:42,847
He's going to

3536
02:55:43,103 --> 02:55:43,615
Reviews Alex

3537
02:55:43,871 --> 02:55:45,407
So Rodger stone is not part of

3538
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,199
No

3539
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:50,271
He's not involved in Infowars at all

3540
02:55:51,039 --> 02:55:51,807
Alex

3541
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:53,599
Is going to be used

3542
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:55,135
Like a f****** puppet

3543
02:55:55,647 --> 02:55:57,695
By these people a very willing pup

3544
02:55:58,719 --> 02:55:59,231
But

3545
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:00,255
It's going to

3546
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:01,279
Tubi

3547
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,047
Harshest

3548
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:02,815
Exploitation

3549
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:06,911
It's going to be a combination of forces

3550
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:09,215
Like my prediction

3551
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:10,751
That it's the

3552
02:56:11,007 --> 02:56:11,775
It's the pechenik

3553
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:13,311
And the Rodger Stone

3554
02:56:13,567 --> 02:56:18,431
Forget him on board with Trump it's just after the first debate

3555
02:56:18,687 --> 02:56:19,199
Are both

3556
02:56:19,711 --> 02:56:20,991
I think going to be accurate

3557
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:23,807
And bumped me to f***

3558
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:26,367
Yeah I don't like the idea

3559
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:28,671
That what led to everything

3560
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:30,463
Is just hatred of Hillary

3561
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:32,511
Because that's f******

3562
02:56:32,767 --> 02:56:34,559
Boring for me yeah but

3563
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:35,583
You know that

3564
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:36,351
That is

3565
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:38,911
The Jaime that's boring but that's also

3566
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:41,471
Really the only conclusion

3567
02:56:41,983 --> 02:56:42,495
You can draw

3568
02:56:42,751 --> 02:56:45,567
Like like that wouldn't have been in my first couple of

3569
02:56:45,823 --> 02:56:47,871
Even suspect when we first started

3570
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:49,407
I mean of the election

3571
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:50,175
Oh

3572
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:51,711
That's really the big

3573
02:56:56,575 --> 02:57:01,439
Yeah but he thinks he's on some sort of external I'm above The Fray I'm into

3574
02:57:01,951 --> 02:57:02,719
Cover stuff

3575
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:06,815
He just hates Hillary yeah he's as bad as anybody in any conservative

3576
02:57:07,071 --> 02:57:10,399
Media Outlet as bad as anyone on Fox News

3577
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:13,215
He's as bad as anybody is as weak

3578
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:14,239
He's as

3579
02:57:15,263 --> 02:57:15,775
Lame

3580
02:57:16,287 --> 02:57:17,055
In terms of what

3581
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:18,079
Drive him

3582
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:22,175
Really

3583
02:57:22,431 --> 02:57:22,943
F******

3584
02:57:23,199 --> 02:57:23,711
Chimeras

3585
02:57:24,223 --> 02:57:25,247
Or something like that

3586
02:57:26,015 --> 02:57:26,783
How fun would that be

3587
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:29,855
If it turns out that was his sticking point

3588
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:32,927
Like baby Trump says something about chimeras in a speech

3589
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:35,999
See that would have

3590
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:37,535
Perfect amazing

3591
02:57:39,839 --> 02:57:43,679
Trump ambivalently said that Hillary Clinton has a criminal problem

3592
02:57:43,935 --> 02:57:44,447
Brett

3593
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:47,263
He didn't even say it that forcefully in that interview

3594
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:50,847
And that interview was terrible that's very bad audio and very short

3595
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:52,895
Yeah this is before they kept

3596
02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:55,967
Saying lock her up

3597
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:56,991
That's part of the whole

3598
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,015
Yep

3599
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:01,855
Sunday shows

3600
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:02,879
16th

3601
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:05,951
Caught up with a narrative yet

3602
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:07,487
A lot of them

3603
02:58:08,767 --> 02:58:09,791
Doing the

3604
02:58:12,095 --> 02:58:13,119
There mirroring is

3605
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:14,911
Dialogue

3606
02:58:15,167 --> 02:58:17,471
As opposed to what he's already shifted the narrative

3607
02:58:21,311 --> 02:58:23,359
There's there a bunch of people were calling in music

3608
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:25,663
He's saying this about the clintons

3609
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:28,479
You're still working

3610
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:33,087
Together it's the same thing as when he said that Barack Obama birth certificate

3611
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:34,623
He was working with them

3612
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:35,647
Because man

3613
02:58:35,903 --> 02:58:36,415
They released

3614
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:37,695
The fake birth certificate

3615
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:39,743
The other foot fake birth is a

3616
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:41,791
Convoluted

3617
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:43,839
But at least his callers

3618
02:58:44,095 --> 02:58:44,607
We're not at least

3619
02:58:45,119 --> 02:58:46,911
But it's fascinating to see like

3620
02:58:47,423 --> 02:58:48,703
They haven't picked up

3621
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:51,263
And I guarantee within a week

3622
02:58:51,519 --> 02:58:52,287
Or so

3623
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:53,311
They will have

3624
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:59,199
I downloaded the new operating system will be following exactly what he says

3625
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:02,527
And it's not because he screams calls obviously

3626
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:03,807
Obviously not

3627
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:04,831
We've seen

3628
02:59:05,087 --> 02:59:06,367
The kind of people who get through

3629
02:59:07,903 --> 02:59:08,927
It's because

3630
02:59:09,183 --> 02:59:11,231
His listeners are so malleable

3631
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:14,303
They're so stuck in believing whatever he says

3632
02:59:14,815 --> 02:59:15,583
But it doesn't matter

3633
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:17,119
Trump is a shill

3634
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:18,655
Trump is a slumlord

3635
02:59:18,911 --> 02:59:20,191
Trump is mob-connected

3636
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:23,263
Either Pied Piper who could lead the

3637
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:24,287
Alt-right

3638
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:27,359
Not even called that at this point but the Tea Party folks the Patriots

3639
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:29,151
You could lead us to fascism

3640
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:32,223
All that stuff is being mirrored back to him by collars

3641
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:34,271
You shift the narrative

3642
02:59:35,039 --> 02:59:35,551
They go right back

3643
02:59:36,063 --> 02:59:37,343
If they're going to follow him

3644
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:40,927
This this thing like

3645
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:42,463
It's so much

3646
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:45,023
The the exact

3647
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:48,095
Fun of cancer

3648
02:59:48,863 --> 02:59:50,399
Like you and I both were like

3649
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:53,215
There's something there maybe there's some invest

3650
02:59:56,543 --> 02:59:58,591
More than just put this

3651
02:59:59,103 --> 03:00:01,919
Yeah this pivot is the thing that bums both of us out

3652
03:00:02,175 --> 03:00:03,455
Super bummer

3653
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:07,807
How much better world are how much more fun world we live in

3654
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:09,343
Seattle is like a black

3655
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:15,999
Or something like that

3656
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:16,767
No

3657
03:00:17,023 --> 03:00:19,583
But it does speak to underlying societal issues

3658
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:22,143
Right but like most conspiracy theories do

3659
03:00:22,655 --> 03:00:23,935
I still think

3660
03:00:24,191 --> 03:00:25,471
A hundred percent

3661
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:26,495
The fact that Rodger

3662
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:28,031
Gaston hasn't shown up yet means

3663
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:30,591
He probably shows a very soon

3664
03:00:32,127 --> 03:00:33,151
Hates Hillary Clinton

3665
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:34,431
And has forever

3666
03:00:34,943 --> 03:00:35,711
Hate the clintons

3667
03:00:35,967 --> 03:00:36,735
Insanely

3668
03:00:36,991 --> 03:00:41,599
Are I predict Larry Nichols is going to show up real soon again he's been absent

3669
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:42,879
The program for a bit

3670
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:45,439
I predicted now all of these

3671
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:47,999
Influences

3672
03:00:48,511 --> 03:00:49,791
Will congeal

3673
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:52,607
I will start using Alex as their mouthpiece

3674
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:55,167
Tricking him in some ways

3675
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,703
To not

3676
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:58,239
Really

3677
03:00:59,007 --> 03:01:00,287
B anti-clinton

3678
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:04,639
If they'll shift it to Pro Trump Rodger Stone nose

3679
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:06,175
Like

3680
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:09,503
You can listen to Alex a couple times and know basically how to

3681
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:15,135
Trickum been around for decades doing it

3682
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:18,719
You could listen to a couple episode

3683
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:19,999
Tattooing

3684
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:24,351
You can find like a couple things that he knows he can sweet-talk Alex with

3685
03:01:24,607 --> 03:01:26,399
And what's Alex's open the door

3686
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:27,167
That like

3687
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:29,727
Maybe Trump is for real I got to get in there

3688
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:31,519
This is going to be our PR

3689
03:01:31,775 --> 03:01:33,823
Campaign this is going to be alright

3690
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:38,687
Machine them longer with the Trump campaign this is how I can

3691
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:39,711
Serve the interest of us

3692
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:42,015
It's still I think

3693
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:43,295
Conspiracy but

3694
03:01:43,807 --> 03:01:44,575
It's not nearly what I want

3695
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:47,135
I'm sorry Dan

3696
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:48,927
It wasn't

3697
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:52,767
Showtimes

3698
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:53,791
It's not closed

3699
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:54,559
Not yet

3700
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:55,839
Cuz he still not

3701
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:57,119
He still not on Trump

3702
03:01:57,375 --> 03:01:58,399
2.07

3703
03:01:58,655 --> 03:01:59,679
1536

3704
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:02,751
Yeah he's not on Washington come back

3705
03:02:03,007 --> 03:02:05,055
So we do still need to figure out

3706
03:02:06,335 --> 03:02:07,359
Pretty quick

3707
03:02:07,615 --> 03:02:09,407
I think our next episode might have

3708
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:11,199
Him turning into

3709
03:02:11,455 --> 03:02:14,527
The false prophet as it were but

3710
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:18,879
There's so many different things about that

3711
03:02:19,135 --> 03:02:19,647
Like

3712
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:20,927
This election

3713
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:22,719
Is going to be

3714
03:02:22,975 --> 03:02:24,511
One of the most studied things

3715
03:02:27,583 --> 03:02:29,119
Also many

3716
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:30,143
Stillman differ

3717
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:30,911
Reasons

3718
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:33,471
Like it's one of the most faceted like if it weren't

3719
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:34,751
Going to end the world

3720
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:37,311
It would be super fascinating to read about it

3721
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:39,103
Like whatever our

3722
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:41,663
Fish-people progenitor

3723
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:43,455
Project

3724
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:46,015
Study

3725
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:47,295
That the mistakes

3726
03:02:47,551 --> 03:02:48,575
That led to their creation

3727
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:51,135
Or the Anunnaki come back

3728
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:53,183
It is going to be like

3729
03:02:53,951 --> 03:02:54,463
Maybe

3730
03:02:54,719 --> 03:02:56,255
One of the biggest things with

3731
03:02:56,511 --> 03:02:57,023
The Democrats

3732
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:58,559
It not not like a

3733
03:02:58,815 --> 03:03:02,143
Sanders would have won or any of that narrative or

3734
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:04,703
You know they didn't talk to the people they didn't go

3735
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:07,007
Campaign in Minnesota

3736
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:08,287
Michigan or Wisconsin

3737
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:11,103
Like that maybe it really is the Democrats

3738
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:11,871
Under s

3739
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:12,895
How much people

3740
03:03:14,431 --> 03:03:15,199
Yeah

3741
03:03:15,455 --> 03:03:15,967
Personally

3742
03:03:16,223 --> 03:03:17,503
Not not like

3743
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:20,319
As much of misogyny as a part of the

3744
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:21,343
Hillary

3745
03:03:22,367 --> 03:03:24,415
It's metastasized beyond that certain way

3746
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:25,695
Like you can hate women

3747
03:03:27,231 --> 03:03:28,255
Hillary

3748
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:30,559
Clint

3749
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:32,607
Piece of it

3750
03:03:32,863 --> 03:03:34,143
But it it's not

3751
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:37,215
It's not like the people who hate her hate her because she's a women

3752
03:03:38,751 --> 03:03:39,263
The dental

3753
03:03:39,775 --> 03:03:42,847
It is what it is is it led to

3754
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:44,383
It was the beginning of that

3755
03:03:44,895 --> 03:03:46,687
Yeah

3756
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:47,711
We need to hate

3757
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:48,479
Somebody

3758
03:03:48,991 --> 03:03:51,039
Hillary is an outspoken woman

3759
03:03:51,295 --> 03:03:53,343
Next to the president

3760
03:03:55,391 --> 03:03:59,999
Claiming that she was one calling the shots and stuff like that

3761
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:01,023
Please narratives around her

3762
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:02,559
Which are easy to push

3763
03:04:02,815 --> 03:04:03,583
Because of that

3764
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:06,911
That's a great point

3765
03:04:07,679 --> 03:04:08,959
Just kind of sits in the background

3766
03:04:09,215 --> 03:04:11,519
Do you have Vince Foster

3767
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:12,543
What the f*** are you talking

3768
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:14,335
But all of these people

3769
03:04:16,127 --> 03:04:16,639
Hillary Clint

3770
03:04:16,895 --> 03:04:17,919
Yeah

3771
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:19,967
Comparatively

3772
03:04:21,247 --> 03:04:22,271
I would say that

3773
03:04:22,527 --> 03:04:23,551
Like

3774
03:04:23,807 --> 03:04:24,575
If there was a

3775
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:27,647
If it was if it was Elizabeth Warren

3776
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:29,183
She has a better

3777
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:31,487
Because they don't hate

3778
03:04:31,743 --> 03:04:32,255
Her

3779
03:04:32,767 --> 03:04:33,279
Personally

3780
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:36,095
Hillary Clinton

3781
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:36,863
Person

3782
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:41,215
Trump would have a field day with it still like calling her Pocahontas and what have you

3783
03:04:41,471 --> 03:04:43,007
Stick nearly as hard

3784
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:44,287
Because she's not

3785
03:04:44,543 --> 03:04:45,311
Hillary Clinton

3786
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:49,407
I think they just underestimated how much

3787
03:04:49,663 --> 03:04:54,271
People-hater I think that's a big part of it and I think Benghazi to the

3788
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:57,599
Fallout of Benghazi is going to be

3789
03:04:57,855 --> 03:04:59,135
Maybe a hint hint

3790
03:04:59,391 --> 03:05:00,159
Japan history

3791
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:03,487
I think because of everyone thinking that she

3792
03:05:03,999 --> 03:05:05,279
Was running guns and

3793
03:05:05,535 --> 03:05:09,631
Man killed Chris Stevens like I think that might be the turning point

3794
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:11,167
In terms of

3795
03:05:11,679 --> 03:05:12,447
What's f***

3796
03:05:12,703 --> 03:05:13,215
Everything

3797
03:05:13,727 --> 03:05:16,543
Propaganda campaign about

3798
03:05:17,055 --> 03:05:18,335
But he already didn't happen

3799
03:05:19,103 --> 03:05:21,919
It's hard to say if the hatred of her would have been his fresh

3800
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:26,015
Because a lot of those other scandals are so deep in the past

3801
03:05:26,527 --> 03:05:27,551
And a lot of them were pretty easy

3802
03:05:27,807 --> 03:05:31,903
Like a lot of those Clinton Body Bags

3803
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:33,183
P0131

3804
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:36,767
141 through all those murders alleged murders

3805
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:38,559
No debunk

3806
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:40,351
A bunch of almost all of them

3807
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:43,423
Suspicious circumstances

3808
03:05:43,679 --> 03:05:45,983
It's certainly are not evidence of murder

3809
03:05:46,751 --> 03:05:47,775

Someone I could have conversation with somebody

3833
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:56,639
On their way
