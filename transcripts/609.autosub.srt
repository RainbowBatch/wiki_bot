1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have a great respect for this knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,864
Alex

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
Jordan

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
What's up

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,032
My brakes are officially mentioned this on the show but I have finished

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Survivor

10
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
A lot of thoughts on it but I might be another medium somewhere else at a future date

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
But

12
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
There's a survivorship hole in my life

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
To be honest

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
As much as years from now Dan sub stack is all survivor

15
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,008
I'm sorry baby

16
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
Think that I was annoyed of kind of bored by the show

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
At various points

18
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Good show

19
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
It has a good

20
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Matches like

21
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
A good environment to see the

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,392
Any of the people interacting and there's fun games or

23
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
And there's tension

24
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
I know there other shows like it but like

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,096
I tried to watch The Amazing Race and it didn't do it for me

26
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Life is really struggling

27
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
Finally found something that kind of works that I'm a

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Enjoying

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Hey it's called

30
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
The world's toughest race

31
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
The Eco challenge in Fiji

32
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
I think I saw that one

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah it's a Bear Grylls hosted

34
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
Like a ridiculously hard

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
Race Across Fiji

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
And just

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
I find myself compelled by the

38
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
I find them charming and I find the locale

39
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
And what they're forced to do to be

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Interesting enough

41
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Capture my attention

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
So

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
The Survivor

44
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
The bug has been

45
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Hitched

46
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
Trapstorno you wanted to start the Amazing Race from the beginning as what I did

47
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
Problem is you got to start with the first season that they have the Globetrotter

48
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
On there and then you're like I'm in

49
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,184
As long as these Globetrotters are teaching me lessons growing as friends

50
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Expressing

51
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
Hyper-real love goose

52
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Delaware I was thinking taco

53
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
Meadowlark

54
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,384
I don't remember any idea other classic drive like

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
I went I went when I was a kid

56
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
And Boston Globetrotters I'm over being a lot of fun

57
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
Even though I was a kid and I was like this is again

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
That's the rule

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
I don't know if you're allowed to grow

60
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,560
Confetti out of a bucket if someone did remember thinking like this is not

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
What time what's it what's your birthday

62
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,728
Yeah that would be my bright spot Dan is

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Begun

64
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
Basic obedience training with my dog Jake

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
That's great he's not a bad dog

66
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,504
He's a sweetheart he's scared of everything that we're we're learning we're growing together

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
The dog trainer is

68
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
The dog trainer makes you feel like you're getting your money's worth she's got that kind of like

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
No Nonsense

70
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,047
I trained dogs and now I'm training you know like that kind of vibe

71
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
You are a dog I went in there and I was immediately like a yes or no roll over until you

72
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
My belly I don't give a s***

73
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
I got to learn

74
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,063
What date I look forward to some Adventures for you and Jake

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
It's because it's not a training of likes

76
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
Something it's like a really bad dangerous Behavior like biting or anyting

77
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
It's just sort of like

78
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Let's make

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
Comfortable dog

80
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Doing that that's

81
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
The big deal

82
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
It is great

83
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Bingo great Jordan

84
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
Episode to go over and it is wild

85
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,687
Yes this is one of the my God it is a roller coaster

86
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Episodes of Alex

87
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
The show that I listen to in a very long time

88
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Scissors October 20th 2020

89
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
That was a tile perfect

90
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
Zayas Wednesday last week

91
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Holyshit

92
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
This thing is full of nonsense

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
Outrageous we've had so much we've had a bunch of different types of episode I've done an episode we got interviews I feel

94
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
So excited to get back

This type

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
You been up to

98
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Let's get back into it

99
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
And here we go

100
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,719
So I feel like wouldn't without further Ado let's get down to our first order

00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
A business which is

102

Thank you so much

109
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
I'm a policy wonk

110
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Aprilia

111
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Barbecue your ass

112
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
It's over for Humanity

113
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
You're Beautiful song

114
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
You're coming for your balls

115
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
It's all over your God

116
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Where is new people

117
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Babies

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Make it a

119
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
The practice of Kalinka

120
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
People pieces of garbage when they are

121
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Hey Jude

122
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,815
But I always listen to that one and I think

123
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
It's so scatological where was your mind at when you work

124
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
Not together I think it was just a couple of those clips in a row at a contacts drops from recent episode

125
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
Maybe when I was going through them they were closed

126
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
Together and I just found them like a cloud

127
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Athena's evolving

128
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Contact drops

129
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
What's today's going to be a situation where the audience

130
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Statues

131
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Which one

132
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Is the winner

133
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
Alright I'm here is Choice a

134
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Is sexual

135
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
God

136
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
OK Google

137
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
I forgot I said it out loud again

138
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
God

139
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Is sexual

140
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Option b

141
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Teenager my dad said if you turn evil I'm going to kill you and I know he was serious about it

142
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Almost interni

143
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
Okay

144
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Good

145
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
Alright so In that clip

146
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
He's kind of saying that honor killing is a little bit okay

147
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
But there is a time and a place for it

148
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Is it

149
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
That's my that's my pick

150
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
They're both bewildered

151
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Truly

152
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,791
We start the show off in Alex's in a place where he has battle adrenaline going through his veins

153
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
You got a big news story to cover

154
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
I can't help it have just adrenaline and

155
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,383
Endorphins flooding through my arteries right now

156
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
What

157
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
Thrilled

158
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Well actually starting in

159
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
The swords clashing in the spears flying

160
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Plunging

161
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
And 130

162
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Two countries in the last week

163
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Income tax but

164
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,151
Tracking everything you do in lifetime

165
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Then

166
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
Tax and control what you do and punish you would level social credit score

167
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
And

168
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
It's all been prepared but it's now

169
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Being announced

170
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
So it it surprise you to learn that that's not true

171
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Absolutely not

172
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Yeah 132 countries didn't sign on to this Global income tax agreement upgrade a One World Government

173
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
What happened is that there have been some negotiations going on between countries and the organization for economic cooperation

174
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,687
Chrisman development Angel agreeing to a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%

175
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,039
Four countries that agreed to be a part of clear up front to

176
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
This only applies to companies with quote

177
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Global turnover over

178
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
20 billion euros in profit

179
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Credibility above 10%

180
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,791
This is really narrowly focused on companies

181
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Yeah so you can't just take

182
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
Your money all the way to Steven pieces of

183
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Because

184
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
When they were countries that don't have any or at very low corporate taxation

185
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Big International businesses have

186
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Big huge incentive

187
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Either actually or symbolically base their business there

188
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
In order to avoid paying massive amounts of tax to their actual base

189
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,903
Country Outlaw tennis players live in Monaco most of the time

190
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
What happens then is that these companies move to low-tax countries are tax shelters and all the revenue that would be being paid

191
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Into the countries they're from

192
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Support the infrastructure and

193
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
Development of their home countries

194
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
It instead just kept by the exact

195
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
In addition to this the plan also Delta

196
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Digital service tax

197
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,663
Countries are able to impose these taxes on companies that are base

198
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,991
Elsewhere but provide services are Goods that are consumed

199
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Their country

200
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,903
Part of the proposed plan had to do with shifting away from digital service taxes and water called a unilateral measures

201
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
United States threatened tariffs against Austria Britain France Italy and Spain

202
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,607
As they were part of this agreement but we're opposed to drop in their digital service

203
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Stacks

204
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Which would have led to Verdun

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Taxation

206
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,543
The latest news is that these five countries agreed to keep their digital service taxes in place

207
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Until the new tax agreement the

208
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
23

209
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
And then they will drop them at that

210
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Sounds good

211
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Obviously implement

212
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
Is it going to be a challenge

213
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
It'll be difficult to make sure these giant companies don't just

214
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Find other loopholes

215
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Or just move to some of the countries that didn't agree to be a part of the arrangement now there's only 132 total countries

216
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
But overall this is definitely something Alex should be in favor of

217
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,703
If his position is one that he's against these gigantic multinational corporations having free rein

218
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
You know the deal isn't

219
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Perfect it's moving in the direction he should

220
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Totally

221
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
But instead we see the complete misrepresentation of what the story is even about from Alice

222
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
And Ally designed to make his audience scared of this corporate tax agreement

223
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
He's trying to trick his listeners into opposing something that would help them

224
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Hurt big businesses

225
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
For somebody who's

226
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
Complained about how the North American Fair Trade Agreement has moved all of our jobs offshore and all this stuff you should also be

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
We like and we should have the money in here as well

228
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Right it's really strange cuz

229
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
It's kind of counter to his

230
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Larger beliefs

231
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
The way he's reporting on this story

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
And honestly surprised

233
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Didn't know

234
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Because

235
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
You leave

236
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
The show with this

237
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Barely comes up he doesn't understand anything that's going on there

238
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,863
Here we go baby

239
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
Actually one of the big problems is that Alex was out late with Rogan's last night

240
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
I can be a big problem

241
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Is a survival-of-the-fittest

242
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Issue I mean

243
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
I don't want

244
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,367
But you you don't protect yourself are you really do deserve to die

245
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
But but but

246
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
The children

247
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
The children

248
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
They don't deserve this and that's why it's the Rubicon

249
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Alyssa after you have died

250
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,471
It's set up a day like I was out with the Rogan the other guys Michael malice

251
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
The children

252
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Children die

253
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
The premise here essentially is

254
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
That the vaccines

255
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
If children are vaccinated that's the Rubicon being cross

256
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Sure I guess

257
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
It's time to kill people

258
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:55,327
Hey are you I'm just going to throw this out there if you're hanging out with a Nazi all the time but you're not

259
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,239
If you're if you're Joe Rogan I mean you're willing to

260
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
It'll put up

261
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
So this b*******

262
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
That tends to mean that you believe it

263
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
At least you're not willing to separate yourself from it

264
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
I would question him about a lot of the content they were going to end up listening to on this show

265
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,463
Like this this is what your damn is huh challenge

266
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
You know I would choose actually pretty right about stuff

267
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
This is a

268
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
Prime episode

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
For them to look at and be like I dare you to defend

270
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Let's go for

271
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
Are you

272
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Alex

273
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
We're out in the Heat and all of his friends

274
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
All these guys were hanging out the real smart

275
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,735
Right I'm a mole

276
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
These are incredibly stupid

277
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Well they're all really smart

278
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Anyway

279
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
They believe that a giant war is coming

280
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
But probably in a giant

281
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
The consensus that this is going to end

282
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
Gigantic massive

283
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
I don't know that consensus between those

284
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
Closest Publix

285
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Telling Tales out of school

286
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Hey dick

287
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
Don't put my business on the street like that you know what guess what I was hanging out with Joe Rogan Michael malice

288
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,751
Anyways World Boogaloo boys I don't know if anybody noticed that real quick but

289
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Civil War

290
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,919
Hey they don't talk about this extremism that they believe in

291
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
Some other things to learn some really interesting things

292
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
But I got couches

293
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
I'm not ready to talk about that

294
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Charlotte from Joe

295
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Runs with

296
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
You can probably imagine

297
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Wiethop

298
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Public roster

299
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
I am.

300
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Elon Musk

301
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
Weekly tell Joanne that's not a secret it is they got to like

302
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Madeon

303
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,575
What does not like we're going and he wants humans to have a future in the future

304
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Say what you want

305
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Weird energy

306
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
IAH

307
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
That obscenely wealthy people believe this

308
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,367
The poor will just eat each other alive haha it's so crazy that

309
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:03,999
Extremely wealthy people look down on the poor and think well obviously their animals who will kill each other

310
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
At the moment

311
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Noticed

312
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
You're assuming that any of this actually comes from

313
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:14,239
People like Elon Musk over made up

314
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Probably thinks we're all going to kill each other

315
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
He does also have a

316
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Pastor

317
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
There we go

318
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
So I I think that

319
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
What I find more interest

320
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Medieval

321
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
Is that Alex is having to thread a very bizarre needle here

322
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Which is the cyborgs Roka

323
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
If they have free will

324
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Well of course

325
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,143
That seems to be counter to a lot of things that he said

326
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
If you still have free will

327
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
Oh oh they turn something on eventually in there that you didn't know was in that your free will is gone

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
Sooner or later you just got to accept that if you get a robot arm

329
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,903
You're going to be controlled by the globalist what is long as you got some free will you chosen

330
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
Hitman

331
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
At work

332
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
I just think this is really dumb anyway for the Alex to try and be like

333
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
Alright maybe I can hang out with you on musk in the future I got to get in with cyborgs

334
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
How am I going to make that okay

335
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Cyborg

336
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
Yeah he's going to want

337
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
The super speed I would assume

338
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
It's

339
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
The man loves

340
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Speed

341
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Dumb

342
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
He's already drawn a line elsewhere

343
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
What I'm feeling

344
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Doesn't match up

345
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
I think you'll find a lot of people that

346
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
What would appear to be harsh boundaries are often very fungible

347
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Through

348
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Ounces is in a state of frustration

349
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
Episode

350
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
He has he has a

351
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Particular thing

352
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
I think it's actually a pretty good

353
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Criticism of people like

354
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
But then he has

355
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,951
To really really shity metaphors

356
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Good Lord

357
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
Last night and this morning

358
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,703
That the reason I've been so frustrated and very very very very clearly

359
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
My frustration

360
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Is that

361
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
The opposition to the new world or does it all

362
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Piecemeal

363
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
They opposed

364
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,735
And that piece and this other piece

365
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Accu

366
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:42,463
And you decided

367
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
You decide to

368
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Focus

369
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
Hair on my foot

370
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
What

371
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Are you talking about

372
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Your god-like I guess

373
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
Little tiny airplane

374
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Microsoft

375
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
What

376
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Coming at you

377
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
That's not pull your head off

378
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Pull your arms and legs

379
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
And a piss on you

380
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,607
And yeah you're looking at it coming at you and you're trying to sweet-talk and he's going to rip your head off

381
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,727
No URL

382
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
Breathing

383
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
And Sass

384
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,919
But you don't know that so you're going to get

385
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,551
This show is not on track

386
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
This is a Debbie

387
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Sir can I

388
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
I understand the metaphor that he's trying already trying to illustrate is the people within the anti newworldorder Community seemed

389
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
To be missing the forest for the

390
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Yes

391
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
Great way of shortening up a 97 trillion gorilla metaphor

392
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Specific detail instead of looking at the bigger

393
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Pixar yes fine

394
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
Neither of those things were great

395
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
I was blown away by everything is like what why are these the specifics

396
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
I really am surprised

397
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Is it in a

398
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Comb

399
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
Measured way of saying like

400
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
You know

401
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
I am going to

402
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Kill you and you're going to try and hurt my hair

403
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Somehow we got off track

404
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,896
Blew me away cuz our God like any creative tiny aircraft

405
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
At what point do you think

406
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Well

407
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,552
Obviously the best way to explain my point is to give you the power to

408
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,368
It's a Conger tiny airplanes Kentucky

409
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Bombay hair

410
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
And that will get the point across there is a time when you're making a metaphor they just got a quick

411
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
Airplane with missiles you know what maybe this one

412
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
I got away from the bride

413
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,360
Let me suggest that if I can do that right

414
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
Whatever Powers could be

415
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
I could shrink myself down and pilot that little tiny aircraft and good luck hitting me with a hatchet then

416
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,136
All these powers that I love like all you have her Hatchet

417
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Can conjure airplane to make your habits tiny I'm going to run away from your house

418
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Airplanes and then they'll become a flying carpet

419
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
And I'll get away

420
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
Oh my God

421
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Yeah

422
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Anyway

423
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
That's a real good kind of example of

424
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
The place is at

425
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,456
Nothing's making a lot of sense you know he's missing the forest for the tiny airplane

426
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
For sure

427
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
I was talked a little bit about his enemies

428
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
They have honed

429
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Aggressive

430
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
Traits isn't what he says

431
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Which kind of

432
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
Struck me as a little bit of a red flag

433
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
Kind of implies like

434
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
It's genetic

435
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Their evilness I was going to say that's racist

436
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
Certainly in the neighborhood

437
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
Why would a fire ants do that's a little baby deer a little pig let her little baby bird while they climb up trees

438
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,832
They like the devil worshippers

439
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
Wonder why they're attacking you

440
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Extremely honed aggressive traits of hyper dominance and an insight

441
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Sociopathic Behavior

442
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,912
And they enjoy killing people

443
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Children

444
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Comprende

445
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
I almost turned the dark side

446
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
What are Cabrillo

447
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
She thought when they started it

448
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
Send your bag

449
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
I enjoyed strangling people

450
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Android

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
I enjoyed

452
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,632
Enjoy it enjoy doing it to children

453
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
I think you do enjoy it

454
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,264
I mean the way that you described it at the very least sounds whisper

455
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
The good old days Soho and aggressive

456
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Traits

457
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
I don't know how like

458
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
I just did doesn't sound

459
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Didn't he described himself

460
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,392
As enjoying the things that would

461
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Be the natural result of

462
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Quote unquote

463
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Honed aggressive

464
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
The traits I guess

465
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
I guess

466
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
You could look at that and say like

467
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
The Hound aggressive traits that he's talking about

468
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Could be learned behavior

469
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
Literally

470
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
I heard that and I thought like well honed over generation it's not quite clear

471
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
It makes me uncomfortable

472
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
No I don't like it

473
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
I think the thing that weird

474
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
We're missing here is that Amanda said

475
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
I like strangling people

476
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
Right well I was too busy turning into a little spaceships in attacking

477
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
And they didn't bother you

478
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Yeah I got you

479
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
Unlike the rest of you

480
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
I love strangling people

481
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,360
I like removing other human beings teeth against their will

482
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
You know I'm like all of you folks we get it totally normal thing for people to think and believe

483
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,856
So Alex is talking about how like it's all up to you know

484
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Is that everything

485
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Sinbad now

486
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
It's no good

487
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Trouble

488
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
And you know what

489
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
You got to wake up

490
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Globalstar

491
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,680
More worried he's going to enjoy strangling me to death

492
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
Do you like to be spanked

493
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Because you're part of the laugh

494
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
You're going to be at

495
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
Then this is going to be cold comfort

496
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
For Alex on The Patriot

497
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
Unless they're going to be in camps as well

498
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Or they'll be killed first

499
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
I don't know this is just one of his standard blood ramps

500
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,952
And so you're going to wake up to that fact and you're going to understand that or you are going

501
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
Knife and your children are going to die

502
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
With you because what you saw in Nazi Germany and what you saw on Soviet Russia and North Korea

503
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,920
All that he'll is going to look like

504
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
Hey choir meeting look like Sunday School look like Grandma knitting you a pair of mittens

505
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
There's something

506
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:45,120
I mean the left tries to harass me and lie about me and exactly what they say or what they do

507
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
Is there a chance of beating

508
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Homeless

509
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,568
In a long protracted collapse and then being put in an emergency center camp

510
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
How this works

511
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Is it

512
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
Mid levels

513
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
You're the smart one

514
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
2 days

515
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
The wolves

516
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
This is just

517
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Business shows a mass

518
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Yeah I mean

519
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
This looks like if you could see inside his mind he's just got a refrigerator with a bunch of magnets in kind of half

520
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Half words and he's just mixing them all together and whatever comes out

521
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Comes out

522
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
The left are going to be in camps and get where is going to be him and his buddies out in the woods

523
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
Doing better than us

524
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
And then once all of the left

525
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
Tour in the camps

526
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,032
Died cuz of the soft kill weapons are Global is still come to the survivors

527
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
Who are the top four rugged individualist

528
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
And be like we were just trying to separate the week from

529
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
You this was really for you

530
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Alex

531
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,808
We wanted to give you the world are just so many better ways of doing

532
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Right

533
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
You know and I mean just

534
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Set the very least

535
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
More efficient

536
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Write this is stupid

537
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Yep

538
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
The kids and buy that Alex beans

539
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,120
They're eventually going to be vaccines for the

540
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Covid

541
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Center children really feels like so far all of these clips

542
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:30,848
If we got rid of the words and just had him repeating

543
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Honestly

544
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Except that

545
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
What you just did was to Folk

546
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:43,136
On message

547
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
They're coming for the children they've announced

548
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
The injection

549
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,864
A 5-11 Italy newborn with a deadly shot that Embraces her immune system

550
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
And they're going to force it

551
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Pause

552
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
Violence and they're going to say then the people.

553
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
How do I put it on the books

554
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,320
The regulations that the main mission the FBI

555
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Military the CIA

556
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
People that don't accept lockdown

557
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,096
I am that they are going to come and they're going to arrest everybody and start killing people

558
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah man

559
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
Yeah this is this is

560
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,184
Suppa's are red

561
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
In here

562
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
They're going to vaccinate children and

563
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
Then people who are against

564
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
Vaccines will

565
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Do some

566
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Do some stuff

567
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
I mean I guess if the FBI goes the Civil War is not all bad

568
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,384
Well I think that the occupation occupation with that is

569
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
I wonder where that come from I don't know

570
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,064
I think it's because people like Comey

571
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
And Mueller were like

572
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,952
Big forget to the trumpets the FBI's kind of something

573
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
Preoccupied

574
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
That might be why you feel

575
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Looks like it's more accessible than

576
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,912
Then some other branches I do appreciate the idea of like

577
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
The battalions all marching and then there's

578
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,104
Just one for the FBI they're all where they're FBI jackets everybody else's in

579
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Full armor and they're like

580
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
Alright we're going to get to the bottom of this real quick

581
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Fantastic

582
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,832
Alex's things like you know I don't want

583
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
This massive Civil War in all this

584
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,304
What makes it really hard to believe is that he keeps calling the idea of vaccinating children

585
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
The shot heard round the world

586
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
Kind of sound it seems like he's building this up into being a point at which you are Justified to kill people

587
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Scotland

588
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,112
And the first child has a heart attack

589
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Throw sand

590
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Cancel

591
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Mine just came out last night instead

592
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
We are going to start inoculating

593
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Halloween

594
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,392
All the bills called 666

595
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
2.66 shots them in the oven

596
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Oh my God

597
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
Billion 660 million

598
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
Leave the Asus page Cardwell

599
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
Their calling card is 666

600
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Oh boy

601
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,416
I promise I didn't splice up a bunch of different things to make that sound convoluted in my testicle

602
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
That was a actual string of thought

603
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
What's that Alex I had on air

604
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
Wow does it doesn't happen to the 70's after the 666 not make it invalidated

605
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,288
The mark of the beast

606
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
It's just like him

607
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
Being dumb and knowing that his audience will like hang onto things lighter Halloween 666

608
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Accessible symbols

609
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,928
Queen and you were expected be awhile well obviously it switches

610
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
Bill Gates

611
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Boo

612
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,120
A couple quick things though in this do Merit rebuttal

613
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
The first thing is actually the evidence of a connection between the covid vaccine and myocarditis is actually it's becoming weaker than

614
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
More information that we gather

615
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
What are the main studies that was used as

616
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
Support for that claim was from the University of Ottawa heart in

617
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Institute headline that claim

618
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
It one-on-one thousand people vaccinated develop

619
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Myocarditis

620
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:34,464
This was from a preprint study and in the process of peer review is discovered that they used the wrong number

621
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
For the total number of vaccines administered

622
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Switching wildly throughout their results

623
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
BP store number on 30

624
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
82 myocarditis incidence

625
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,216
In 30 2379 vaccinations

626
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,544
When the number was actually 845 thousand

627
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,848
930 vaccination

628
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
That's a little bit

629
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
Little office

630
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,320
Retracted by the authors who apologize for the error but people like Alex in the Gateway pundit who screamed about it if never acknowledged

631
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Retraction

632
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
There's not a cover-up of people having heart attacks

633
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
It's something that was seen as a possible

634
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Full side effect that

635
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
Examined

636
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Substantiate

637
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
But there is a significant increase.

638
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Dinosaur pericarditis

639
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Can people who

640
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Been vaccinated

641
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,544
Although as more information comes along the understanding of these things will

642
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
Will develop

643
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,712
Right I have no idea who Alex is talking about when he says that other people covering up vaccine-related resignation

644
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
But if you wants to get more specific I'll look at it at that point

645
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,416
I'm pretty sure he's just to talk about that story from a while back where two people at the FDA resigns and I analysis

646
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
Decided to exaggerate

647
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
Always announces their evil plans on Halloweens though

648
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
That's that's pretty exciting

649
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
Today announced on Halloween new ghost costumes

650
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,152
Also according to the White House the actual timetable of vaccinations for children ages 5 to 11

651
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,248
Quote will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process

652
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Timeline

653
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
What are planning efforts

654
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
Me and it will be ready to begin

655
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,928
Shots in arms in the days following the final CDC recommendation

656
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,280
In the same press release they mention that the cdc's committee meeting to discuss this

657
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
He's scheduled for November

658
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
3rd 2nd and 3rd

659
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
So I'm going to guess

660
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,984
They're going to miss these spooky deadline of Halloween Evil plan

661
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,288
It really would have been fun to hear those like

662
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Oh there's a razor blade in this and the candy at this house instead it's like

663
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Those people

664
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
F****** vaccinate you

665
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,040
Do you walk up there they're like here's some Eminem's in them

666
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,392
Immune to disease there's a Pfizer vaccine in my Apple

667
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
Terrified

668
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,536
So Alex is another headline about

669
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Forced vax

670
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
It's a little off

671
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Here it is covid

672
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,264
Teams cannot vaccinate pupils against parents wishes schools toll

673
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
Australia

674
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,088
In Latin American countries as well

675
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
You just you're going to do it

676
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
What that sounds like

677
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
That causes convulsions and death and heart attacks and and and

678
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Blood clots and strokes

679
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
Dad comes up to the school and when you know what that does to you

680
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
What does that oh my God

681
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh my God

682
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
The anti-vax terrorist

683
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,504
We all want that by the way

684
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
What

685
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
Whoa

686
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,928
Terrorist

687
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,256
Oh boy

688
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Exercising is

689
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
Very dark

690
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,704
Yeah that's a headline that Alex is basing this

691
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
The Killing school nurse is on its from the guardian

692
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
Article from September

693
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,920
I just has to do with how vaccinations would be carried out in

694
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Schools in England

695
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
As it stands quote

696
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,552
In cases where parents withhold consent but the child w

697
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,648
What's a go-ahead the guidelines say the vaccination teams will determine if a child is able

698
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
How to make an informed decision

699
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Known as

700
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
Gillick competent

701
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,560
And make every effort to contact a parent in check

702
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Before they proceed

703
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
He's only relates to students

704
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Between the ages of

705
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
12 and 15 and it's a pretty narrow window of application

706
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,384
If a parent doesn't want their child to get vaccinated and the child also doesn't want to be vaccinated there is no vaccine

707
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
If a child apparent disagreed the first effort will be to

708
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
To determine if a child is gillick competent

709
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
How to make your own battle

710
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Decisions

711
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
If they are not being competent

712
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Then they will not be vaccinated

713
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
In the parents words

714
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,744
If they are deemed competent then they will be vaccinated

715
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,072
But before that every effort goes into trying to reach agreement

716
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Between the child and their parents

717
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
This article has absolutely nothing to do

718
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,776
But student than any other country it has nothing to do with anyone being forced to be vaccinated

719
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,640
Reporting this story is almost tailor-made to Insight someone toward the very violence

720
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
He's pretending to not be in favor of absolutely

721
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Cockroach Jesus

722
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Also that's

723
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
That's such a silly

724
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
We live in 2021 the kids are going to be like

725
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Are you sure you can choose this we're going to have to call your parents in like

726
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Dude they believe in q

727
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,584
What the f*** are you going to say to them but going to convince them to fax

728
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,192
Fascinate me I can read the internet I'm going to go give me the f****** back day

729
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,080
Yeah and very litigious age we are in

730
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
Going to be a situation where people are like

731
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
Let me poke you

732
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Just come over

733
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,624
School is gone out of existence can donate blood and I'll give you a vaccine

734
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
I want under attack do Jordan

735
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,816
What time in School nurses are about to be alive

736
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Call Leonard

737
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,288
You're not in Kansas anymore

738
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
The collapse is already here

739
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
Everywhere total Psychopathic murderer

740
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm going to want to follow up

741
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Next week

742
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
And the week after that

743
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
I would like to know who he knows who got the vaccine and whether or not they are still alive

744
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
How are you saved

745
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
Just have covid

746
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
Maybe

747
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,832
I also would like a follow-up in a week when he's in a little better mood and everyone

748
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
It's not going to die

749
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,696
What happened to others that he's not crabby

750
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
Oh yeah it does seem to be that he's kind of just taking stuff out on us

751
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,424
Feel like this is abusive

752
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,776
Yeah kind of feels like maybe he's pissed off about the safety hook lawsuit

753
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
That not going

754
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
To a trial for him to have fun with

755
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
And then also maybe you didn't get enough sleep cuz he was out with a rogue in the night before

756
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Everyone's going to die

757
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
Yeah and it just comes out as like

758
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
Complete nonsense

759
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Gibberish

760
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,768
All the scientists that were even on the payroll

761
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,240
Basically

762
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,384
Believed in the poison vaccine to the training vaccines and the human cloning all that I thought it was really

763
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Develop

764
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
Hypertension for themselves and others

765
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
We're really just going to kill everybody

766
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,416
You know we're not going to get away with this where they're going to kill us

767
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
You say

768
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
Roll a die 200 yeah you're all going to die

769
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
Who is figure this out

770
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
That out yet

771
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,688
You just said we did boy

772
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,344
Wild what a wild thing to do disorienting and some of that like

773
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
I am

774
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
I don't even know how to

775
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
Lego appropriately set up a lot of these clips

776
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
To make that make sense

777
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
I get with you

778
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
He's talking about

779
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Just from Context Clues

780
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
But if you were to listen to this cold it would be

781
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Very bewildering

782
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
Yeah yeah yeah

783
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,496
Talking about a claim

784
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:51,104
That is not true at all of the scientists who were in favor of the

785
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,663
Shots at the FDA and the CDC in

786
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
All these places have turned on the vaccine

787
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
And are now coming out with it and

788
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
Part of the reason that they're coming out against them

789
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,367
Is it they realize that the plan isn't

790
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
Kill 90% of the population

791
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
They're also not going to survive

792
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,303
But they didn't do any of that

793
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Not even

794
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,191
You know here's what I would

795
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
Like if I was growing up

796
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Say I was 11 or 12

797
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,615
And my dad was pretty unstable

798
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,687
But everytime he had a hangover and it at the

799
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
Disable before I went to school he would say

800
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
You're going to die if you go to school today

801
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
You would think that's an abusive man

802
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Yeah right

803
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,023
Point that out when I was listening to

804
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
Complete nonsense gibberish

805
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,703
I don't even know how to categorize it if you were somebody who didn't listen to Alex

806
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,775
It would be disorienting you probably turn it off

807
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,103
I listen to him I understand right

808
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Just makes me more sad

809
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
I would almost call this weaponized nonsense

810
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
I think you nailed is a little bit just like

811
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
It's the mood

812
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
The feeling

813
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
I could use a snack

814
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
Here's where we take our first loop-the-loop

815
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
In the roller coaster that is in the show

816
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
Okay Alex starts talking about

817
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,031
And it's about time I was worried that after the 666 we weren't going to get anything after that might be

818
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
A couple of Clips here

819
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
Need to be Mike.

820
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Here's the first

821
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
You know I'm not one that

822
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
Afraid of things

823
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Agenda confront them

824
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
I need Jesus to

825
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Take control of me and in not

826
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,439
Let me just

827
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
Everybody else is joining with it out fear

828
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,703
Almost everybody's joining it out of your nuts there's not a lot of people seething with the power of Lucifer in their hand

829
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
That's the people

830
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
And if you don't

831
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
The powerless proceeding in your hands

832
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Nazi

833
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
Lucifer

834
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
I got the power

835
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:06,783
I don't want it

836
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,575
And I

837
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Rejected

838
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
But I'm telling you he's a gentleman

839
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
This year's the Takeover

840
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
This is the one ring

841
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Oh boy

842
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,727
So Alex apparently can see Satan because he has the power of Satan right through his hands what you were Jack

843
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Xprite

844
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Wooboi

845
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,383
I mean a Rogan what do you think of this

846
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,967
Going on right now huh needs to intervene for his

847
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Health and safety

848
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
I mean I said that

849
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
A year ago but I mean at just like

850
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,879
If you are if you heard this

851
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
And you're on the radio you should be like

852
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,023
Well we got to stop with all this political stuff I'm an Infowars fan

853
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,423
I need to make sure Alex is going to be okay I feel like it 100 like serves him right in there we need to

854
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,823
I feel like if a hundred of his longtime listeners got together they should be able to 5150 up

855
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
Absolutely

856
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,199
Absolutely

857
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
Competition out there in absolutely happen

858
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah he can he can see the devil

859
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
Cuz the devil

860
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
He's running through his hands which is something

861
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,511
That is only allowed in a power that is the people who are above Bill Gates

862
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,071
Which implies that that is the level that Alec

863
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
Text belongs on

864
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
But he is a reject

865
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Did it to help you Jordan

866
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
To help you see the lights

867
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:34,847
So he can tell you who the demons are understand the impulse to follow someone who's very

868
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
Openly says

869
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
I can at any point in time

870
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
Act as strongly and is evilly as the devil all I have to do is pick up this evil

871
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,695
Bright right and you better you better by my Turbo Force or else I might be

872
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,535
I would very much appreciate

873
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
If I'm going to go pick up the devil

874
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Willpower

875
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
It takes like 30 seconds

876
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,959
So hard for me to pick up the devil's hour

877
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
Very bad

878
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
To think

879
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Power of the devil is

880
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
Accessible to somebody who is

881
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,175
So moody

882
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,575
I think about all of that s*** where we will like all women shouldn't be president

883
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,463
Conover so we have some powers of the devil

884
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
God

885
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
It it's

886
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,095
A little a little rich

887
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
Man mentioned being charged

888
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,935
Anything

889
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
I don't know I don't know why he does this but

890
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Abusers

891
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
Oh this is what I wanted to say

892
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,015
I honestly don't care if he believes this or not

893
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,319
Like somebody it might say like

894
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:53,183
Will you take it you actually believe that he thinks he has the devil's power running through him or whatever

895
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:59,583
And my response to that is he either does Believe it or he is a sane person rationally deciding to

896
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,679
Pretend that on are on a show like his

897
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
And neither is

898
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
F****** awful doesn't require

899
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
It's a belief

900
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
2

901
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
To work backwards from what he just said and say

902
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Oldest person

903
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,575
If you are if you are choosing to say those things without believing that clearly an insane person

904
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
Maybe more Danger

905
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Probably play

906
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,839
It's the one ring

907
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,703
And that's why Lord of the Rings it's so powerful by j.r.r. Tolkien until the top professors

908
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
I got to stop even right there for

909
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,615
This real quick

910
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:55,903
Website Rate My Professor

911
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
Off-the-charts on Netflix

912
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
Beyond minion psychology

913
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Because

914
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
When they can't even thinks about taking the reins even

915
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Even observing the ring

916
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Look at what they're doing

917
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
Into the mind of

918
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
That's very

919
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,111
Literally starting

920
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Man

921
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
That's why sometimes I have to go up there because

922
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,351
Just I reject the devil

923
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
I completely rejected

924
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
So I

925
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
I don't know

926
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
I wish

927
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,919
Did I could go back in time

928
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,503
And have a recording of me hearing that for the first time

929
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,367
Because the blurt laugh that I made I don't know if I can ever recreate it

930
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,975
It would such a huge laugh

931
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
What a f******

932
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Stowaway

933
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,447
Yeah but I forgot I have to go off air when the power of the

934
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,799
The devil becomes too tempting to make

935
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Ever

936
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,687
I don't think you understand it don't try to understand it

937
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
And to just

938
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,551
Just I mean it listen

939
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
I just

940
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:36,255
Looking into the f****** palantir right now the eye of Sauron is upon me

941
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
And I can't do the show

942
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,911
I'm sorry I put my hand on it now I'm controlled by Sauron it's over for me

943
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
And that's all because

944
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Of what

945
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
One of the top present professors in history

946
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
You told me right

947
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Sprite

948
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:56,223
I do I think I had some pretty good professors in college I wonder how they drank at school

949
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
I mean

950
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,159
I don't think I would Rate My Professor

951
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,791
You have a great idea for a couple semesters of formal logic

952
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,631
Took a game theory class from him that I wasn't even interested in because he was an intern

953
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Compressor

954
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,727
Probably not as good as Tolkien

955
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
I mean my high school English teacher

956
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Professor

957
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
He was actually a first-class playwright

958
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
In New York

959
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
4 likes

960
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
15 years

961
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,831
And then he was just so sick of it that it was like fine I'll teach high school English in the middle of nowhere

962
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,159
Browser

963
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,511
So what you got understand

964
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,071
Is that the devil has a lot of schemes

965
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,655
And I wants to seduce you with things

966
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
Phone who does

967
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
You know your phone

968
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Yeah

969
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
Mark of the beast no

970
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
It's an alien brain

971
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,639
You know what these really are these so-called

972
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Phones

973
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Are super high tech

974
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Computer

975
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Platform

976
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
Are the brains of robots

977
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
Come when I call a

978
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,647
Android phone Android it is

979
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,695
The brain of an Android know

980
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,487
And

981
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,863
This is to take control of your life and just run everything

982
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Seductive

983
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
I'm coming out I've seen it

984
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
I have them

985
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
And the iPhone nuts

986
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
13 or 11 is coming out about a month or whatever

987
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
I had a chance to look at one and it's just

988
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
Fallen technology

989
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
Old

990
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
What are we doing

991
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,679
The devil has improved the camera

992
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:58,591
Is it just no no I reject that when they call it an Android that's

993
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,919
F*** off when they call it an apple that's because it's made of Apple

994
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:06,527
That's dumb get out of here go away

995
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
Old Scratch Out Here

996
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,135
Old Scratch Out Here making your camera better

997
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:18,559
Tell me what this is still going to be like Old Scratch over there

998
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,191
How did like he's pretty interested in this new phone is it better than anything you could imagine

999
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
Wow

1000
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
Very dumb

1001
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,847
You goes to break and he comes back and like lives

1002
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,431
Just doing dramatic voice-over type s*** about the end of the world

1003
00:52:54,399 --> 00:53:00,543
Foretold of old

1004
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,943
Old Testament prophets Thousand Years

1005
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
The alien attack on Earth takes human form

1006
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:20,511
Anyone that exception

1007
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,911
Destroy

1008
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,055
That's basically what he wants to do all the time

1009
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,359
It's clear that that's like his passion

1010
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
Kind of

1011
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
The Empire and the rebels have

1012
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
$6

1013
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,063
You want to do last time on

1014
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
Yes what times

1015
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Yeah absolutely

1016
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Hoof

1017
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,791
In the Book of Revelations

1018
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Right

1019
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
We were going to end up

1020
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Situation where the globalist

1021
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
They're going to cut off all food

1022
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:07,359
And then eventually they have another plan and that is Truth and Reconciliation committee

1023
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
Which actually

1024
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
The globalist

1025
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
If you if you believe this

1026
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
They tried to get Alec

1027
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Text to do what

1028
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,831
And then they're just going to cut the food off next

1029
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
If you want food

1030
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
You're going to have

1031
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,839
And you were wrong and that you were a fraud

1032
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,167
Reconciliation communist thing they do that's already begun here

1033
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,287
I know that got me to 300 meetings.

1034
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
My Little Falls

1035
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,479
Highest levels directly obviously reach out to us

1036
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
And

1037
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,111
You said you just need to come do a true reconciliation

1038
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
Call Jeter and we'll make it bigger never bad

1039
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
The only protection

1040
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,231
In this dangerous world

1041
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
No thank you

1042
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,591
If you do I tell you that it's real right

1043
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
No

1044
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,943
If I have to filter through my like what

1045
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
He could be

1046
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:22,111
We possibly talking about I'm going to guess that it's some point he had an offer from a network like Fox News

1047
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
Who's that recognize that

1048
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
He had a lot of talent

1049
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:30,303
And he was somebody who maybe they could find a place for on the network sure and what would need to happen but

1050
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
Before they could have him on

1051
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Is

1052
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,959
Never contracted some kind of a public cleaning up of his image

1053
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:43,359
Maybe there's some sort of an apology they make for something

1054
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,919
I could give you a job that would be really high paying

1055
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
On this News Network

1056
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
It's not the communist

1057
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,063
Trying to get a Truth and Reconciliation committee go

1058
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:58,463
If this is even based on anything that actually happened that's the version of it that I kind of believe could be

1059
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Here's what I'm starting to

1060
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
Okay

1061
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
People have been saying that Alex

1062
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Who is Bella

1063
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
CNL

1064
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
And that's very

1065
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Clearly not

1066
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,311
Trail right we've been watching a 20-year 25-year long-form improv schedule

1067
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:18,943
Alex is actually delclos that's what it is he does seem a bit

1068
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,271
See that's what how do you spell The Herald

1069
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Cowboy

1070
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,439
I don't know I think the delclos might be a better actor than this

1071
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,023
Because Alex starts talking about how he got this offer with the truth and Drake

1072
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,303
Conciliation

1073
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,351
He starts talking about how he's

1074
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,655
Is he was at least boardrooms

1075
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
I meant it turns into him talking about how he lived that scene in network

1076
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
Out of here

1077
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,383
I meant Alex does a lion reading

1078
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
You know like in the Big Board rooms

1079
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
In d.c.

1080
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,991
Boardrooms in New York

1081
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
Boardrooms in Los Angeles

1082
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
Montreal all those cities

1083
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
Pool

1084
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,927
Howard Beale speech

1085
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
Network is that speech

1086
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Think you just

1087
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
A business deal with the bill

1088
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,703
It's not a business deal

1089
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Church

1090
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Exhaust system

1091
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
You are a unit

1092
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Of this church

1093
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:24,223
And I'm miserable in the final equation we're going to destroy your soul

1094
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,167
I got your attention thermocouple

1095
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
12 inch screen

1096
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,103
Countries and borders and Nations and people

1097
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
There are no Nations there are no

1098
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
There's only

1099
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
Corporations and Company

1100
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,439
Each of us is just a little piece of that

1101
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
Larger

1102
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,535
And Missy you're obsolete mr. bill

1103
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
Your non-essential mrmeola and we're going to kill you mr. meal

1104
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,703
We're going to give you the same speech that you've given throughout history

1105
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:21,055
I'm going to clean this time it's for a good cause and we're of the favors the world

1106
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
But the truth is Mister Beale we don't like you cuz you're smarter and better-looking Minaj. Can I get the God and we want to

1107
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
Hurt you in a ritual

1108
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,063
Mommy

1109
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,159
Are we still in the movie I don't remember this fight

1110
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:43,327
Where do the copies of your children

1111
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
So

1112
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,703
Are you going to join us mr. bill

1113
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,519
Get you a little off track from Network

1114
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
You know mr. Jones I feel like that was I think that was great I think we've seen all we need to see

1115
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:04,319
We will be getting in contact with your agent of Michael Savage's phone number

1116
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,367
Appomattox review

1117
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,975
Michael Richards

1118
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,095
Yeah I think I think that some of the beach

1119
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,167
Beats of the networks

1120
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,983
Buffalo

1121
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:28,383
Added a few Mr Smith Goes to

1122
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
So I just keeps going

1123
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
Stupid Beyond satire

1124
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
Also you're not going to join us

1125
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,791
But you're going to fail and you know you're going to fail we're going to beat you or going to be Humanity

1126
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Course we are

1127
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,751
If you won't join us

1128
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
So now you'll notice has turned into a dialogue instead of a monologue of this character giving the speech

1129
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Now Alex exist within the

1130
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
The seeing

1131
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,015
And he's talking back to the person which is a

1132
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Fascinating gramatik

1133
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Turn

1134
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
What it looks like

1135
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,447
Nelson

1136
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
I really need to do that

1137
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:35,455
Infowars.com tomorrow's news today it's a demon

1138
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:49,791
Somebody there was like we got to get him off of this we're going to throw on I'm 96 lb beam

1139
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,607
I bet he's going to have no choice but to switch into

1140
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
People will be right back

1141
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:01,055
Yeah just can't not do it free soft mellow music

1142
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
People fix everybody

1143
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
My God that's

1144
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,295
Beyond satire that is just as you can't do that you can't do that

1145
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
Somebody working there has to

1146
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
To be like

1147
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
That has to be a choice

1148
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
That's on purpose happens enough

1149
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
That they're like it

1150
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,839
Stop the music is so disjointed from what

1151
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
Two glaring that music

1152
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,239
Release not frequently

1153
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,127
That's like them we're going to be back at Applejack we're having technical difficulties f****** theme music

1154
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,711
Let's all go to the lobby there might as a yes that's exactly what that was

1155
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,527
So you may be noticing

1156
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,319
This point that we have not

1157
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
Covered a lot of content

1158
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,695
There's been a lot of Alex having a weird mood

1159
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,791
There hasn't been really a ton of actual meat

1160
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,887
You know I was thinking I haven't heard you read from a lot of note

1161
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:02,751
What's so far has been listening to a man screaming incoherently

1162
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Yeah

1163
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,431
Any plays another one

1164
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,991
Okay let's play a report

1165
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
And then

1166
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,623
I may be able to control myself and actually cover all this

1167
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Doubt it

1168
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
This little piece of paper

1169
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,511
Right here is the death warrant of our children literally

1170
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
Add

1171
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,423
So he's going to cover but he's not

1172
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
Got to go to another grease report

1173
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Vine

1174
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,359
Kick the Can down the road will see you see if we get to it when we get to it

1175
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,407
You know I'm going to I'm just going to say it

1176
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
You know

1177
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,991
You've got the death warrant literally

1178
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
In your hands

1179
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Them admitting it is really kind of

1180
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,135
True

1181
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
Exactly

1182
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
So I heard

1183
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,023
This was just me desperate for

1184
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
Anything to

1185
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,863
To talk about

1186
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:05,727
Oh just stay inside for 15 days and it'll all be over in the course it wasn't

1187
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
Are you so you would have a 15-day

1188
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
Don't leave your house

1189
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,919
Areas of Africa and Latin America under imf-world May control

1190
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
Still locked in their houses

1191
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
1 hour day

1192
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Excuse me

1193
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
Some areas of Latin America you get

1194
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
2 hours a week

1195
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
According to your

1196
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Social security number

1197
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
What numbers

1198
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
All of that is coming here

1199
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:36,447
So the first obvious thing that jumps out as a sign that Alex is making this story up is he saying the people in Africa and Latin American countries

1200
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,519
I'll get time outside based on their social security number

1201
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Yeah that one

1202
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,615
I don't know when the Social Security Administration expanded operations

1203
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,199
Include the entire world but unless that happened and I didn't hear about it

1204
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
Social Security numbers are just something that people in the United

1205
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
Well I mean f

1206
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:56,415
CR Truman followed that up by expanding Social Security

1207
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
Route to the

1208
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
To the world

1209
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:03,327
For someone who's so concerned about immigration related issues Alex should really know this

1210
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
Super Bass

1211
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,375
Sick thing that intersects with

1212
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Student visas and

1213
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Ford workers

1214
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,007
All these things that he yells about all the time but that

1215
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,311
People being groped by social

1216
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,871
Security numbers is kind of a big part of his long-standing

1217
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:20,479
FEMA camp narrative or should I think it might be something that he's pulling from there

1218
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
At the draft

1219
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,551
That kind of thing

1220
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,599
Actually referring to although

1221
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,671
I have to admit that I may be making

1222
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,279
So the financial times has a tracker on their website that updates

1223
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,327
It's on covid lockdown policies

1224
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
On a country-by-country basis

1225
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
They have this hope

1226
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
Big paper where a number of political scientist

1227
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,263
From Oxford develop what they call a stringency index

1228
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:49,407
All the precise details over there too complicated for us to get into here but suffice it to say that they took indicators like

1229
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
School closings restrict

1230
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Gathering

1231
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,759
And stay at home requirements

1232
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
Did the consideration

1233
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,855
And they created a means of quantifying lockdown wrist

1234
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,439
Naturally this is a figure the changes for any given

1235
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,023
And Country over time but the lockdown tracker is regularly updated

1236
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:10,399
The only two countries in Africa over a 75 out of 100 are Uganda and Namibia

1237
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
And in Latin America

1238
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
There are just too also it's Venezuela and Argentina

1239
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,383
All those countries only Namibia and Venezuela are over in 85

1240
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
Looking over the qualifications and rankings if you had a country making people stay inside for all but two hours in a week

1241
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,695
It would have to be over 85 on the scale just on how highly they would score and all the other categories

1242
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
Would be a domino effect

1243
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,399
Good website for the US Embassy in Namibia their latest update was from October

1244
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
20th 2021

1245
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,263
If you look at that updated restrictions Daryl loud

1246
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
To go to public Gatherings up to

1247
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
The 200 people

1248
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,895
Fitness centers pools beauty parlor schools

1249
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Open grocery stores are all open

1250
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,063
You can't buy booze on Sunday or on holidays unless you're staying at a hotel or a casino

1251
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
Hotels

1252
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
Casinos are open

1253
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,207
Desert camping Namibia that Alex is talking about sound like

1254
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
What about Venezuela

1255
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
It's got to be Venezuela

1256
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
Reporting I've seen Venezuela's actually

1257
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Closer to what Alex is saying but he's still wrong

1258
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,703
The government in Venezuela had been trying and at

1259
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,823
Speed implemented what was the 7 by 7 plan where they would alternate weeks of strict lockdown rules

1260
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
And lacks locked

1261
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Down rules

1262
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:28,991
During the last week's most businesses and public spaces could operate normally but during strict weeks

1263
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
Only essential businesses were open

1264
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
And

1265
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,343
I can't find any evidence building

1266
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
To stay inside their homes or anything

1267
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,951
The government also has been operating a fuel.

1268
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,511
Distribution schedule since the end of last year

1269
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
Where Vehicles could

1270
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:45,887
I'll be fueled on specific days based on the last number of their license

1271
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,263
So it's the last number of your social

1272
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
Keeping up with the Social Security

1273
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
I'm not entirely sure

1274
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
But also according to the outlet

1275
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
Venezuela analysis quote

1276
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,455
Maduro announced

1277
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
Also announced that the country would

1278
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,295
Suspended 7 by 7 model

1279
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,879
It's all a week of strict lockdown followed by a week of more relaxed

1280
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
Text measures

1281
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,743
Instead barring any outbreaks the country would abide by looser measures from the

1282
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,791
The start of November until the end of the year

1283
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,095
As part of an attempt to boost economic activity

1284
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
So very recently this

1285
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:23,263
This whole plan was going to go by the wayside by the present

1286
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,567
I don't know what else is reporting on but

1287
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,967
Nonsense for a bunch of this episode and I kind of wanted to learn something

1288
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
Another we talked about

1289
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
Some details of the real world

1290
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,439
Here is back to our regularly scheduled um program

1291
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
We're dead already

1292
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
I think you just need to get used to that and understand it's about your spirit not the body

1293
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
Hellboy

1294
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
Gypsy now I'm just

1295
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,983
Hearing that 90s music in my head all day

1296
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,871
You're not a bother you need to stop being attached to your body

1297
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
You're a soul

1298
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
You're dead already

1299
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,247
Murphy's

1300
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
Demon face

1301
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,623
It's not going to leave me for a long time though

1302
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,207
Ethel Davis bespoke

1303
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
I just feel like it

1304
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
It's something that

1305
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
I could go into a song

1306
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,095
Somehow

1307
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
It's

1308
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
Goofy

1309
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,591
I'm waiting for lin-manuel Miranda to follow-up Hamilton with the

1310
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,615
Infowars

1311
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Music Hall

1312
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
Called

1313
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
Infowars

1314
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Colon

1315
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:42,111
It's a wild things that I really love to is it so clear that like he just run out of things to say

1316
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,927
And like had the couple seconds out of hell

1317
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
Totally it was just a little came out of

1318
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:52,863
I love it if there no no intention behind it and didn't mean to happen

1319
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Just out there

1320
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
I know that

1321
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,263
A lot of people in Alex's communities on his friend

1322
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
And stop

1323
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,311
They want to kill FBI

1324
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,847
But

1325
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
Even if you do kill all of them

1326
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
It really wouldn't matter

1327
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,247
You shouldn't do it it really wouldn't help

1328
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
Which is somewhat confident

1329
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,391
They're going to try to trick you

1330
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
Into becoming like them

1331
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,815
And running around murdering each other did it almost no one even understands this

1332
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,143
You can tell a country

1333
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
That makes sense

1334
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
Nothing's going to happen

1335
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,615
Because

1336
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:42,271
That doesn't mean we let him take us to FEMA camps and kill us this is the discussion

1337
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
We got a case of

1338
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:48,415
Germany on Russia

1339
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
On PCP

1340
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,255
We are we are

1341
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Control

1342
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,031
They want to crush

1343
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,335
Humiliate Americans

1344
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,663
Your guns that are going to take your food medicine away

1345
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
We've been hit by a biological attack

1346
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,319
We're in the middle of a biological War

1347
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
With mega-corporations

1348
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
World government

1349
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
And the chairman of the board

1350
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,719
Is a fallen off-world entity

1351
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
Yeah I just

1352
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
This is

1353
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,263
If you believed any of this wasn't bulshit you'd be

1354
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
F****** firing out your window

1355
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,615
I would have

1356
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:43,711
Disregard just like every everything yeah if you believe

1357
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,295
Any of this was real if you believe any of this was real

1358
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695
Being on the radio would be too much of a risk you need to be dug in Wasilla

1359
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,535
Sandbags and wire around

1360
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
You need to

1361
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:03,167
Somehow burn all your identifying documents live underground

1362
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:09,567
You know like the developer full-on Breakaway Society underneath the Getty like you were always meant to

1363
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,847
The implications of

1364
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,895
The things that he's pretending

1365
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
To believe

1366
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
Are so staggering

1367
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
That it's

1368
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Dumb to think

1369
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,087
That he'll be doing what he's doing absolutely

1370
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,207
That's nonsense the idea of if there was a bioweapon released

1371
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
That is a

1372
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,327
Beyond Reason

1373
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
You know like I've asked you can't

1374
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
You can't

1375
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,311
Unjustify everything if there was a biological weapon released upon the People by its own government right

1376
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,871
Rules are out the window

1377
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:48,735
Why are people reporting on the Supreme Court total government is released

1378
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,807
Do you need to like

1379
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,623
I could get your neighborhood together and like

1380
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,207
Do something

1381
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,863
I don't even know what you do but you do so yeah yeah it has to be a complete break away a collective

1382
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
Radio show about those for you kind of skim headlines and then a ram

1383
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
Campbell

1384
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
Spell dumb pills should I do

1385
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
Do the change thing

1386
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
I know

1387
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,271
Make people buy

1388
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Pills I did

1389
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
Kind of gift

1390
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
The feeling

1391
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:29,183
More so than normal that he's killing time

1392
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,535
Like it really felt to me while I was listening to this that this is just like wow

1393
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,607
I'm going to run out the clock

1394
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,215
Here comes the

1395
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Horseman

1396
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,823
And the writer on it was named as

1397
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:53,503
Brave brave brave brave

1398
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Wow

1399
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Yeah

1400
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
Yeah

1401
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,167
The spirit of antichrist is surging on the planet right now

1402
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
And

1403
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Change disciples

1404
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,567
Very excited

1405
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,503
Because they are rolling headlong over the edge of a cliff and when you're falling off a cliff

1406
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,599
Piles Jagged broken

1407
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Putting

1408
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,159
Iron Spike sticking up

1409
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,975
It's exhilarating isn't it

1410
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
Did the class

1411
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,815
This is killing time

1412
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,839
Yeah

1413
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,911
That's that's one of those things where it's at

1414
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
You didn't do the homework

1415
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
When do the homework

1416
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,615
And you're just tapping on the desert wow can't believe somebody would like to a Horseman Called Death

1417
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,175
Somebody was just like hey

1418
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
You didn't do the f****** work keep it up

1419
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:02,367
Hell I got God how dare you accuse me of not doing nothing over-prepared that's why I'm doing this

1420
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,719
Apotheke La Petite clock

1421
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
Oh man

1422
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
I asked you this from time to time

1423
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,143
That's the bees that are being written by

1424
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,215
The Horseman of famine that terrifies me

1425
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
I asked you this from time to time

1426
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
And it's never fair

1427
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,663
I don't never get it right

1428
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
But what is the global

1429
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,247
Hosta plant

1430
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,903
I feel like we've already established that they're going to

1431
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,695
Withhold food from us to get us

1432
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
To do their bidding

1433
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,511
Will be some food involved

1434
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,815
Yeah trying to kill 90% of us

1435
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
Wow

1436
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:50,239
Ono Ono

1437
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
Okay here's our plan

1438
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
100% survey

1439
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
No

1440
01:14:54,847 --> 01:15:00,991
One's a little bit racist

1441
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,575
Demons

1442
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,695
God's Amazing Creation

1443
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
But I like

1444
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,535
I don't have that in mind

1445
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Uno

1446
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:20,959
It is just a launching point for us into the third dimension and Beyond that's a normal thing I said

1447
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,007
Josh and dominion over it by

1448
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,335
The Establishment has decided

1449
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Going to be

1450
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:34,271
And so to create a self-fulfilling prophecy they have Grease the skids for the collapse of Humana

1451
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,111
Show that those of us that have not collapsed Wheels

1452
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,183
Be tempted in the end to join with

1453
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,719
The Darkside

1454
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
To save ourselves and help exterminate the Giant

1455
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,863
I don't control several populations that

1456
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Will be

1457
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Traveling across

1458
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Cross the Earth

1459
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,727
Army of

1460
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Locust

1461
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
Chewing everything down to bone

1462
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,247
You look like

1463
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
They'll have a new blood

1464
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,343
Paw Patrol games

1465
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
I won't be Undead

1466
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,231
Anime mouth psychology

1467
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Psycho

1468
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Sprint

1469
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,119
So now apparently the globalist yeah

1470
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:27,775
I'm struggling to understand this plant so could you give me the full rundown I think

1471
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Just sorta

1472
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,103
Glanced over a couple of the first step

1473
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,223
I like the covid lockdown destroy the food supply or whatever

1474
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,063
So you know developing countries everybody please from them

1475
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,879
And that's their plan is the globalist

1476
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,951
Plan is to try and make a Civil War by bringing

1477
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,975
Immigrants in

1478
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,559
Then Alex will have to have a civil war Exterminating

1479
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
Them

1480
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:57,983
See now I feel like I'm going to throw this out that Alex doesn't want to do that I'm going to throw this out there

1481
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
What if

1482
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
Now here's a whatever

1483
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:05,407
And this is going to blow Alex's mind all right what if we

1484
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,175
Work

1485
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,967
The globalist plan

1486
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,295
Buy instead of starting a civil war over immigrant

1487
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
We accept

1488
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,903
And then we all get together

1489
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,695
And fight against the globalist together

1490
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,231
No

1491
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,791
Oh well

1492
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,655
Can see that I have not yet convinced you

1493
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Continuously

1494
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:32,543
Okay will do this is becoming an intractable situation is it not

1495
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:38,943
Yeah well you can't really fight the tide over the globalist plan

1496
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,319
Civil War in the immigrants are the way to do it then

1497
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:50,719
Birthday plants by just enjoying and then I'd liking the buddy you don't seem to understand

1498
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,071
Immigrants

1499
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,471
I just need a large-scale justification for my actions

1500
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,287
Very wrong

1501
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:10,943
But I need to be able to sleep at night so it's got to be part of the globalists plan that is forced to exterminate

1502
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,991
People who don't look like

1503
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,063
Yeah it does feel like a lot of this show

1504
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Today

1505
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Is just

1506
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Him trying to

1507
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Express

1508
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,695
That he is

1509
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
Filled with nothing but

1510
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Violin

1511
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Rage

1512
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
And the impotence

1513
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,935
His inability to express it in anything resembling a healthy manner

1514
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,751
Is just what we're seeing through work

1515
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,079
He's just hoping that somebody else will carry it out for him

1516
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,223
Yeah I just hoping that somebody that listens to a show will cause some kind of a disaster that he can call a false flag

1517
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
And then he can

1518
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Get that cycle going

1519
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,855
Yep but you can't do anything on his own without

1520
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,183
It just seems boring whole of actor in

1521
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,999
Violence I mean you see what he's doing

1522
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
And it is app

1523
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Absolutely the case that

1524
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,631
Like when we bet his first description of the night before is like

1525
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Oh you guys are all

1526
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Boogaloo boys

1527
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
That's what it is

1528
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:11,359
You're just saying that the two Awards, acceleration is 9:50

1529
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,175
That's what it's looking like

1530
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Thankfully

1531
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
At long last

1532
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Alex gets grounded

1533
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,135
You know this is the best

1534
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Start

1535
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Libby call about this

1536
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,487
Let me first show you exhibit a

1537
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
FDA

1538
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,351
Policy

1539
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
And it's got the stamp on it

1540
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Talked about so much

1541
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
August 23rd

1542
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
2021 this is what

1543
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
This is what binds talking about

1544
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
This is the

1545
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
Testing

1546
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,991
On babies and children

1547
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,647
And I knew that well we didn't

1548
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Call Troy

1549
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,727
It's okay we'll just do

1550
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:14,080
1812

1551
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
We'll test it on babies and

1552
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,464
Migraines

1553
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
Only two strokes

1554
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,328
Very exciting new way to mispronounce myocarditis

1555
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
Wow

1556
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,448
Surgical asked me to figure out what Alex is talking about something super vague

1557
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,776
Eventually he does give the document number that he's looking at

1558
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,080
But it's presented in such a way that it's useless

1559
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,224
Also I guess that big news that he's lawyer friends are planning to break has been broken he just broke

1560
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,296
Last breath.

1561
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
Yeah

1562
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,648
I mean maybe he's really confident that no one's actually listen

1563
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
Probably

1564
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,744
So what what's going on is Alex's mind has been blown

1565
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
And he's acting like a violent little baby on his episode because he found a letter from the FDA to Pfizer and by

1566
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,984
Text that they're biologics license application had been

1567
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Approved

1568
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
Letter from

1569
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
Back in August

1570
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:20,896
I need a new drug that needs to need to apply for one of these to be allowed

1571
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:24,224
To engage in interstate commerce and this is just that approval letter

1572
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:29,088
It's not Nifty a policy whatever Alex thinks that means I don't know what that mean

1573
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,648
But this is exhibit a of his

1574
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:39,328
Excited for Matlock to make a case. Cuz so far this is thin

1575
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,216
The rest of the exhibits better be stepping it up to kind of account for this

1576
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:49,824
Can I make a spoiler WhatsApp

1577
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,176
This is not going to go to it is not going to be in our favor

1578
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,272
Alex tries to read a little bit from this letter and

1579
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,136
That's why I thought I was reading from page 5 of this.

1580
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:08,512
Stn bl125 742

1581
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,072
4 / 0

1582
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
6

1583
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
At the annual report

1584
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,680
Ingles gas report on

1585
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,472
Post-marketing studies requirement

1586
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,008
Commitments

1587
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
And it talks about

1588
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,176
Pediatric studies c459 1001

1589
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,504
Evaluate

1590
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,368
Vaccine in children 12 years

1591
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,904
15 years

1592
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,512
And it's commentary in children

1593
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,584
12 years through 15 years of age

1594
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,656
Describe how it's a

1595
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
There their they're saying it's a

1596
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
But it's actually prove in the future

1597
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
When they think they're going to

1598
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,480
See how that works

1599
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:06,368
What a man to be a woman and then

1600
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,392
It's not true

1601
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Great

1602
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,976
So your sample

1603
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:15,072
I definitely heard Alex try to claim that the Pfizer vaccine hadn't actually been

1604
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
Approved yet

1605
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:20,192
I never knew what his evidence was because it's absolutely not true

1606
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
But I guess this is at

1607
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,752
This letter

1608
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,568
This is still from that

1609
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,896
FDA letter

1610
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:32,736
This is a paragraph where they're requiring Pfizer at Buy wintech

1611
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,552
To submit a yearly Report with the title

1612
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,112
Quote annual status report of pose

1613
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
Post-marketing study requirements

1614
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,000
In the latter they're setting out guidelines and requirements

1615
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,816
That's for what the company will have to do to maintain its license

1616
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,864
And one of those things is postmarked

1617
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,632
Getting studies

1618
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,168
The letter says quote

1619
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,472
We are deferring submission of your Pediatric

1620
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,312
Studies for ages younger than 16 years for this application

1621
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,896
Because this product is ready for approval for use an individual's

1622
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,432
16 years of age and older

1623
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,248
And the Pediatric studies for younger ages have not yet

1624
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Completed

1625
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:11,648
The section that Alex's reading is referencing the one of the studies on children

1626
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Aged

1627
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,720
12 to 15 that has its results panda

1628
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:19,328
And the final report on that is to be submitted by October 31st

1629
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
Probably where Alex got Halloween from

1630
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,656
2023

1631
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:29,568
There's a full study on children aged 6 months to 12 years that has a final report Due on May 31st 2020

1632
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
4 + 1

1633
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,896
Under 6 months that

1634
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
It's supposed to be done

1635
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,456
By October 31st

1636
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
20

1637
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
24

1638
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,784
That doesn't mean that

1639
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,368
Will definitely take until then but that's be proposed timetable

1640
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
But Alex's

1641
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,696
Those dates are set in stone is wet

1642
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:49,536
When these things will be noted that when they'll be approved

1643
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,328
Incidentally

1644
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
This letter was from

1645
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,424
And since then Pfizer has released the results

1646
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,496
Of a phase 2/3 study that reflective

1647
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
Very positive response

1648
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
In children Age 5 through 11

1649
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:07,200
In participants at 5 to 11 years of age the vaccine was safe

1650
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:10,528
Well tolerated and showed a robust neutralizing antibody

1651
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,672
Just this week the FDA looked at the data Pfizer collected in their study and NPR reported that they said

1652
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,256
The quote kids size doses of Pfizer's covid-19 vaccine

1653
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
You're highly effective

1654
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,072
At preventing symptomatic

1655
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,864
Confections in elementary school children

1656
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
And cause no unexpected safety issue

1657
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Kids size

1658
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,520
Jacuzzi lower the do now here's where they made him

1659
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,080
Mistake it should be called Fun Size

1660
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,128
And Halloween

1661
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
PS

1662
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:40,992
Right that's what you do

1663
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Hire me

1664
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,552
Branding I'm there

1665
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,112
Anyway Alex says this letter that has a

1666
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,160
Some dates on it and I guess he's just

1667
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Misinterpreted

1668
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Decided it's

1669
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:53,024
Conspiracy

1670
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,816
Fall back on his transphobia

1671
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,376
Like he's got to take this swing at Rachel Levine

1672
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
For no reason

1673
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,960
I think he's mad because he's decided that

1674
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,728
They're saying

1675
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:06,080
She's the first woman four-star Admiral but that's not true people are saying that

1676
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,872
Right

1677
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,896
Such a raw butt

1678
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,920
Michelle Howard

1679
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,224
Was promoted to four-star Admiral on July 1st

1680
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,784
14 really unsurprising that he

1681
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,088
He doesn't know that there was another woman

1682
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Right

1683
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,160
I just

1684
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
I find his bigotry boring

1685
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
And it's awful

1686
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,536
Karachi has to fall back on because

1687
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
This is so weak

1688
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
As being the evidence of his

1689
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,704
Conspiracy theories dates but he's taken out of context

1690
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,496
Witness approval letter

1691
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,544
For the biologics license

1692
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
For Pfizer

1693
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,872
2

1694
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,920
You're do interstate commerce with their vaccine

1695
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,200
It's

1696
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,016
Yeah I mean it's really it's really despicable

1697
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,040
How

1698
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,344
Easy it is for them to just

1699
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Throw out

1700
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Trans

1701
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:55,744
Laika in the end without thinking it's like

1702
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
I mean banana

1703
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,864
I feel like there might be some more coming up

1704
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,168
What is really horrific

1705
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,192
Did not even

1706
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,984
Stop for one second and think

1707
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,800
Maybe this is not just a bad metaphor

1708
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Horrific

1709
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:10,848
Sickly big

1710
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
Yeah

1711
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,272
Alex get back to talking about the dates in the letter a little more he doesn't really understand what's going on

1712
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,552
Doesn't know what he's talking about

1713
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,136
Bizarre long fantasy

1714
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,952
Great study completion May 31st

1715
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,488
2023

1716
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,840
October 31st 20

1717
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,848
Approve it

1718
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
What

1719
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,368
Gaslighting

1720
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:58,208
You want to build cars there's no cars in car lot that sell them

1721
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Chicken

1722
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,584
Dimitri

1723
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,216
And yes

1724
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,544
Spell shopping

1725
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,848
There's a jaguar

1726
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,664
F-150 it's blue you don't see it

1727
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,456
Gaslighting

1728
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,736
What's going on here

1729
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:27,392
Anythink

1730
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
And then

1731
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,488
The UN world leader arrives

1732
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
For just a couple years

1733
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:41,472
What

1734
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,568
Yeah a lot of people died previously we got a billionaire so dying

1735
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,552
The leader just gets a little bit

1736
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,976
Terrorist start blowing things up you know who they are

1737
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,512
Christians

1738
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,352
Everybody

1739
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,168
You're the same terrorist you always mRNA Factory

1740
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:16,032
They're the ones that did it

1741
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,128
Gr they cherished gr they the ones that just won't accept

1742
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
Sis

1743
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,712
They just won't do what they're told

1744
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,016
Religious leaders

1745
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,088
Saying that we all need to go to prison or BJ

1746
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
You see the popo

1747
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,976
Beautiful prophet

1748
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,048
Don't tell us that they aren't humans

1749
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,608
People are nasty

1750
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,632
Christian

1751
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:47,264
If I'm not mistaken Alex spends most of his show saying that his enemies are demons and other

1752
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
The devil

1753
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,848
He spent most of his this show saying that

1754
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,664
Well explains why his dump a&m-cc imagine

1755
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,968
The pope would act the same way

1756
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
So

1757
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
Like

1758
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,832
The primary thing that Alex is doing throughout the step

1759
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,880
Episode like with this fantasies of blowing up

1760
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:06,208
MRNA factories right and then talking about like what

1761
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,280
He goes and runs over the school nurse

1762
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,608
Cheese's Keys preemptively creating a wave

1763
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,912
Four people in his community

1764
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,960
To see the inevitable result

1765
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
Of his rhetoric

1766
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,032
The worldview that babe

1767
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,616
Profit off of actually being the actions of their anime

1768
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
And it's

1769
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,712
You know we see this over and over and over again

1770
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,504
With Alex

1771
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,296
The smug

1772
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,088
Condescension

1773
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,648
Towards me for not

1774
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,184
Instantly believing

1775
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
That he's telling the truth about a plan

1776
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,816
That he is going to change tomorrow

1777
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:47,680
It's so f****** infuriated he is smugly make it

1778
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,728
Here's what they're going to do next

1779
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
You idiot

1780
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,592
You stupid fool you don't believe me this is what this is what they're going to do next

1781
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:58,176
3 years from now that tomorrow is going to say something funny

1782
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,016
F****** hate that that's so annoying

1783
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,320
So going back to the beginning of this when Alex

1784
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,112
Who's talking about the FDA letter

1785
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,696
This clip you just playing games with the dates

1786
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,464
And information

1787
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
These dates are asked

1788
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:16,864
Estimates on deadlines for when specific randomize triple blind studies need to be done

1789
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:23,520
It doesn't mean that that's when they will be done or is it reflective of one preliminary information will be available from these trials

1790
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
Princeton

1791
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,824
That exact

1792
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,128
Preferred Pediatrics study that Alex is referring

1793
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:31,968
2 c459 1007

1794
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
Was the one that was meant to look at

1795
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,784
The vaccines effective

1796
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
Children aged 6 months

1797
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344
12 years

1798
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,416
According to this letter that data shouldn't be available

1799
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,696
Until May 31st

1800
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,976
2024

1801
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,792
However the vaccines and related biological

1802
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,864
Do product advisory committee at Pfizer just released a brief

1803
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,144
Document for their meeting

1804
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,448
That's going to be held on October 26th

1805
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
2021

1806
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,056
And you can find all the preliminary data from that study in their briefing

1807
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Document

1808
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:04,480
This is the date of that was talked about earlier that Pfizer relisted released an initial press release for a back in

1809
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,552
It has since been reviewed by the FDA for the

1810
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,088
Kid sized

1811
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Doses

1812
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:14,464
What else is doing is taking a month old lighter that has some dates in it that he doesn't understand

1813
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,328
What is waving his arms around yelling about how they haven't released the data that he's too lazy to go in

1814
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
This is just sloppy meaningless work

1815
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,936
It's meant to create the impression

1816
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
Of something and

1817
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,008
Did they build all meaningless

1818
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
And don't forget

1819
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,824
He's insulting us Wylie

1820
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,640
Right

1821
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,664
Really fun

1822
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,248
Elaborate fantasy of his own coming oppression

1823
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,552
BR something goes on

1824
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:45,440
The big mega churches will be where they have the guillotine chopping their heads off

1825
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
Okay

1826
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,144
Lot of time lining lying about

1827
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
God's right

1828
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:03,104
This is all going to come to pass and your local megachurch will be at your local execution Center

1829
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
That's actually in the news here I'm I'm going to

1830
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,504
Megachurches Sports Stadium

1831
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:15,392
Okay so I may I think he's just going off of some reports

1832
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,160
That

1833
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:20,768
Community centers are two schools may have vaccination Nation by interstate Ave

1834
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:25,632
So you go on about this though it's not just megachurches brochure

1835
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
Football game

1836
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Cover story

1837
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,504
You're going to be hung up by your feet

1838
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,136
They're going to be taking over

1839
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,184
Where are the keys to our world

1840
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,464
They like to do that

1841
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,256
Cuz you see

1842
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,096
I think Alex watched squid game

1843
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,120
Okay so

1844
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,192
If they're going to hang me at a stadium

1845
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,776
Could it be at least on one of the days when show his pitching

1846
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:11,200
You know so you guys you're hanging there to be my last day I would like to at least see some

1847
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,248
Good game I feel like that's a request

1848
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,136
Could be put submitted in paper format will see

1849
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
I just think that Alex watched

1850
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,768
And that's exactly what he's doing

1851
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,144
Because anything that's in pop culture and is a movie at the time he's speaking

1852
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Something he will be

1853
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Describing to you

1854
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:38,336
Alex moves on from this topic and then he starts to get a little bit

1855
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Bummed out

1856
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,872
Right

1857
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:44,224
Cuz here's what I mean there's a lot to be bummed out if this is what

1858
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,088
What is the problem

1859
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
Is that

1860
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,648
The FDA hasn't approved

1861
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,952
The covid vaccine was Alex's pretending

1862
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
Where is that

1863
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
But that's not true

1864
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Now

1865
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,608
Simultaneously people constantly make fun of Alex

1866
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,168
Is the supplements that he sells aren't FDA approved

1867
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,984
But neither is the Pfizer vaccine excited

1868
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Right

1869
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:11,360
But anyway his supplements are FDA-approved

1870
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
In for it

1871
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,920
And I love the leftist media

1872
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,456
John Oliver Oliver

1873
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,808
Jones sells unapproved supplements

1874
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:26,208
The church down the street is unapproved it's not run by the state-run religion

1875
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,816
No it's not found

1876
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
When they tried to take

1877
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
Over

1878
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,912
Supplement industry in the mid-90s

1879
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,704
But they have no jurisdiction over

1880
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,008
That's true

1881
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,568
Only when you try to stay

1882
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:46,176
Your supplement is a drug or competes with a drug that you're down there

1883
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,600
In South Central LA and maybe the

1884
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:58,720
MS-13 Latin Kings dramatic

1885
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:07,936
True supplements

1886
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,728
Milk

1887
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,360
BFDIA largely doesn't care about

1888
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,944
Supplements unless something is actually dangerous

1889
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,248
Get in trouble with the FTC because they end up

1890
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,064
Making unproven and almost always not true claims

1891
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
How about their product

1892
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:25,856
In the marketing

1893
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,160
Materials which is what's covered by the Federal Trade

1894
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,256
What's Alex's question the FAA has a lot to say about milk

1895
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:35,840
Guidelines of a company's approved to ship milk rules about

1896
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
The factories

1897
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:42,240
Produce milk milk and be very dangerous even have a 447 paid guidon wedding

1898
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,800
Exactly grade a milk is

1899
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,920
As for oranges gas the FDA has thought there too

1900
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,200
Their rules

1901
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,224
Orange juice

1902
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,016
Like pasteurized from concentrate

1903
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
What can be called Orange

1904
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,320
Joogsquad

1905
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:00,160
There's a rule that artificially colored oranges must be labeled as such

1906
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Plainview

1907
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
On its bulk labeling

1908
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,352
Counter card sign or other appropriate device bearing prominently and

1909
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
Inconspicuously

1910
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,680
The fact that the oranges are artificially colored

1911
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:16,544
There's a 1973 declaration that made it official what was marmalade

1912
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,104
Because there's a controversy

1913
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,688
About using citrus fruits and marmalade cuz you have to add more sweetener

1914
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
And maybe that's not Barbra late anymore

1915
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,856
That one starts that 1973 declaration starts

1916
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,416
Under the federal Food Drug and cosmetic Act

1917
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,744
Techno standard of identity has been established for marmalade

1918
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,768
This is a

1919
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
Problem

1920
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,608
Iiiii appreciate the way he framed

1921
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:46,240
22 is like when the Government tried to take over the supplement industry in the 90s they found out they had no jurisdiction

1922
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,264
Not

1923
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:53,664
A massive unregulated business with a s*** ton of money paid off a ton of politicians to make sure that they never regulated

1924
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:57,760
They didn't have jurisdiction the American government's like

1925
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,784
Wait a second

1926
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,808
We can't

1927
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,344
Regulate.

1928
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,952
That is a good clarification I don't think

1929
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,976
Food or a drug

1930
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
But the EPA definitely has some thoughts about what is

1931
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:13,632
Clean air and what is not

1932
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,680
Lake Butler

1933
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,496
The point that nothing should be regulated ever

1934
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,592
I guess if you think things are regulated that's cuz you're stupid

1935
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,128
Like

1936
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,920
Yeah dude does the FDA

1937
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,456
Have thoughts about milk

1938
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
Or oranges

1939
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,760
Yes absolutely

1940
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
About the things

1941
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
You put inside

1942
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,904
Stupid

1943
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,720
But Alex is struggling man he's having a tough day

1944
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,000
It's just

1945
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
Retard

1946
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Earpiece popped out

1947
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
It's really hard to

1948
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,008
Just sit here with this one.

1949
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,104
Get out 11 things.

1950
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,896
Is it possible

1951
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,432
I try I couldn't even

1952
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,200
Cuz you can't

1953
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,248
Get this Justice

1954
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
This is just evil

1955
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,088
And just make a lie

1956
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
A saying that

1957
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,720
Two women had a baby in a California prison

1958
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,048
Wow

1959
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,192
Four Star General

1960
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
It's all just

1961
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
Cuckoo Land

1962
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,776
Put a f****** loser

1963
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,080
So here's what Alex

1964
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,408
Does FDA letter giving a license to buy wintech

1965
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,968
And Pfizer to Market their vaccine is just a

1966
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,528
Impossible for him to cover and do justice to

1967
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,392
He found some dates in the letter in decided

1968
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,696
Conclusion that the Pfizer vaccine

1969
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,976
Show me FDA approved

1970
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:48,352
The media is lying to you saying that is because they plan to approve the 2024 when the Testaments

1971
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,376
Did the letter r.

1972
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,424
This lying that the media is doing

1973
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,984
Alex compared to a prisoner

1974
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,776
Situation and Rachel Levine

1975
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,336
Would you give us two stories that do nothing but highlights

1976
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
End up

1977
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,152
Push Alex's transphobia

1978
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,016
The story about the transwoman impregnating a fellow inmate at a California prison

1979
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,808
Isn't a real story

1980
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,832
Unsurprising

1981
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,368
Yeah it was based on a meme

1982
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,672
PolitiFact describe the situation like this

1983
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
An image of what looks like a

1984
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:18,816
Pregnant inmate in orange jumpsuit is being shared on social media

1985
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:23,936
California inmate pregnant after being forced to share prison cell with transgender woman

1986
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:30,080
PolitiFact they reached out to Terry Thornton the deputy press secretary for the California

1987
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,104
Department of Corrections

1988
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,176
Who confirmed that there were pregnant women in custody but

1989
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:37,504
They were pregnant when they were admitted to State Prison

1990
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:44,160
This is just a transfer pic backlash to California passing Lee transgender respect agency Integrity Act

1991
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:49,024
Allows incarcerated transgender non-binary and intersex people to request

1992
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,792
Steube house

1993
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,328
In a Men's prison or women

1994
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,864
Prism that is consistent with

1995
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
With their gender identity

1996
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,728
It's most likely saw this meme or was made aware of it be

1997
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,776
Because Steven Crowder did the segment on it which

1998
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
Tim kicked off YouTube

1999
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:06,688
Yeah because the story wasn't real and it was essentially just anti-trans propaganda designed only to spread hate

2000
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,272
Baby turns out view the story

2001
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
And even possibly the meme originated

2002
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,880
From a story spread by a member of the women

2003
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
Liberation Front

2004
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,232
Do the group that NBC's described as quote

2005
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:24,608
A self-described radical feminist organization best known for its opposition to transgender rights

2006
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
So they literally called themselves to her

2007
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:33,824
In 2019 representatives from the women's Liberation Front were part of a panel hosted by the heritage

2008
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,848
Foundation

2009
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:37,920
Where members said such gems as calling accepting

2010
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,200
Trans people quote

2011
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,248
A social Contagion

2012
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,600
Play this is the information flow that Alex uses to get some of his

2013
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
Reporting

2014
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,136
S***

2015
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:49,440
It's just it's just meant to

2016
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
Yeah

2017
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
Spread

2018
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,024
End justifies the

2019
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
The spreading of bigotry

2020
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Yeah

2021
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
You know it's

2022
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
Think about it

2023
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:02,240
But if you if you're reading and sharing that meme

2024
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,520
You want

2025
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,128
You know you'd like to believe it because it can form

2026
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,152
To what you're

2027
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,944
Vacations are of people

2028
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
That you have a pret

2029
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:16,832
Exactly like the idea of wanting of a being like Oh that's

2030
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,112
Comforting to know that

2031
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:21,952
Trans people are evil in my in my

2032
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,232
I'm glad I have another

2033
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,768
Piece of evidence to prove

2034
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,072
Right but my hatred is Justified

2035
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,096
And it's

2036
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,424
Stop think for one second

2037
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,448
You're just a

2038
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
F****** a******

2039
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:39,616
Do we have this

2040
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,152
Snowball rolling downhill

2041
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
And getting to app

2042
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
Point where you know Ali

2043
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224

2044
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,528
Competing theories Giselle f*****

Please

2046
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:51,648
Not true stories as true as justification for

2047
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:54,464
Why it's so hard for him to do his job because

2048
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,488
Do this

2049
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,280
FDA lighter

2050
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,072
Alex you didn't do the homework

2051
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,096
You're going to have

2052
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:03,168
Have to go home when about this and then do your report tomorrow

2053
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:08,288
And I want no transphobia

2054
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Then

2055
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080

2056
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:15,456
Fill in for him if you wanted to display at I didn't do the report I should take the day off

2058
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
So again Alex Drive

2059
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,320
Now cover this after you a letter

2060
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,344
Study gets distracted

2061
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,672
This is a pretty big deal

2062
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,560
You just type in US Food Drug Administration

2063
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,960
Dla approval Pfizer's comes right up

2064
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:37,728
Apartment website

2065
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:44,384
But you won't hear Riders talking about it cuz the Reuters Tio is on the board of Pfizer

2066
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,992
Short video

2067
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
Instagram

2068
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
Put in 30 minutes left at Narita

Eclipse

2075
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,288
Sporting event

2076
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
Tell you the propaganda

2077
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
Effective

2078
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,176
It's paid for by Pfizer what's a little bit of revise though

2079
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:32,768
Brought you by Pfizer

2080
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,584
60

2081
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,864
A little bit silly

2082
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,400
It's just a collect

2083
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,424
Program sitting

2084
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,704
Includes disclosure

2085
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,984
But they have some sponsorship

2086
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,032
TripAdvisor

2087
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
Especially if you can

2088
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:48,640
Can find the same networks like CNN or ABC or CBS

2089
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,688
Running stories that are negative

2090
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,992
About Pfizer like all of them did

2091
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,016
When they were fine

2092
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:56,064
2.3 billion dollars in the Bexar

2093
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,856
Scandal back in 2008

2094
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
Yeah

2095
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,464
The person who's on the Pfizer board that Alex is referring to his James C Smith

2096
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,512
Actually stepped down as CEO

2097
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,816
A company that owns Reuters the tops

2098
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,840
Incorporation

2099
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,120
In February 2020

2100
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,168
Well he was CEO they ramp

2101
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
Plenty of

2102
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:15,520
Critical stories about Pfizer just not ones that are based on things that Alex

2103
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,080
Is making up right and wants everybody to

2104
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,872
The focus on

2105
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
To that

2106
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,016
Alex you're brought To Us by my pillow so

2107
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:33,440
Years and years where you did not disclose or disclosed it regularly they were brought to us by

2108
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:39,072
I wonder I wonder about the ethics of that

2109
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
Compared to the ethics of the

2110
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
Clear disclosure

2111
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,728
Pfizer sponsoring program

2112
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,568
Alex thinks he's doing a good job

2113
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:56,224
I'm getting disappointed

2114
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,296
Getting discipline now

2115
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,608

Organic concentrated ingredients

2129
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:54,080
Get those ingredients so I've told them just as fast as you can make it

2130
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,712
I said

2131

I don't care 500 come in if you have the ingredients

2132

2133
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,136

Spend more money

2140
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,240
Less money I need money

01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
What the f***

2185
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,816
Business model with a big neck

2186
01:49:55,072 --> 01:50:01,216
And then slowly is a good dog

2187
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:04,032
Come with me and you'll be

2188
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,968
There's demons everywhere

2189
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,504
Hey come on guys

2190
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,528
With the demon fist in the air

2191
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:20,416
Reese's report cigarettes put out

2192
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:26,560
Dead on

2193
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
No way to wiggle out of it

2194
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,008
And their answer is to say a man is a woman is a 4-star

2195
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,288
Wow

2196
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
Star Trek

2197
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,016
And there's worse support

2198
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,856
You're twice as likely to die twice as likely to get covid

2199
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:55,232
20 plus times more likely to develop cancers

2200
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,096
20

2201
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,264
This is just unbelievable

2202
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:13,920
This is actually really fascinating decided to check in

2203
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
Because Alex

2204
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:17,248
Don't have the clip of it but he says it's his best work

2205
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,064
I got to find out

2206
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,136
To explain to you what Gregory's did

2207
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,440
Referring to as this bass

2208
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,512
Just work we're not going to listen to all

2209
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,792
Of Gregory says report

2210
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:30,560
Cuz his voice

2211
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
Really f*****

2212
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,352
Annoying

2213
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,912
So he put together a video that is just

2214
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,936
Full of Unser

2215
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,984
Instantiated shity claims like

2216
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
This one

2217
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:45,408
Destroying people's commune systems

2218
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:52,832
Overtime especially between 40 and 70 years old

2219
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,880
They have already lost

2220
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,928
40% of their immune system

2221
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,208
Capability

2222
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
Sure or how about this claim

2223
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,560
At this rate by Christmas

2224
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:08,960
We will have 0% immune system capability

2225
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:09,728
Over 40

2226
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,288
And by March everyone over

2227
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:15,872
Will have lost their immune systems as well

2228
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,640
No it means us

2229
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:22,272
And it does seem like Alex's just like I don't understand the world so I'll hate

2230
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,552
Trans people

2231
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,320
Alphabet is

2232
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,344
A lot of his model

2233
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:29,184
So I decided to check out this video and see the evidence for myself

2234
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,000
Through this boringly voice video

2235
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:32,768
Tell you

2236
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:34,560
The level of information abuse

2237
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,608
What's going on here actually impressed

2238
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,168
Like

2239
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:42,496
I listen to Infowars I watch this stuff

2240
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:45,056
And I can see you like this is what happened

2241
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,080
This

2242
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,384
Fingerprints of effort

2243
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,664
On it which is

2244
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,432
Very rare

2245
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,712
Birthday zombie

2246
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,480
Congratulate

2247
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
First of all the part about the

2248
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:58,880
The 20 times increase in cancer in vaccinated people don't come from any data and or is it

2249
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:00,160
The front of UK report

2250
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:04,768
This one's just from a life site blog entry cited

2251
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,792
Doctor from Idaho

2252
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:09,632
This doctor is pushed false stories about covid in the past and unless there's a

2253
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:11,680
Verifiable information here it's dumb

2254
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
I'm just take his word for it

2255
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:19,360
Idaho Idaho

2256
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,384
Responses

2257
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
Doctor Potato Head

2258
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:27,808
The other claimed one of my people losing various percentages of their immune system

2259
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,088
It is much more

2260
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,392
This was actually really fun

2261
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:37,792
For me to try and sort out immediately thought of the story that they f***** up where it's like because they're

2262
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:40,096
The dropping antibody total

2263
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:40,864
There

2264
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:44,704
Bullshiting Us in being like your retirement system is going away.

2265
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,872
Part of the defense of this point of probably but it's not the source that they're pointing to

2266
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:52,896
Alright

2267
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:56,736
So this story is based on a blog post on a website called the

2268
01:53:56,992 --> 01:54:02,112
Expose which I guess is some kind of an upstart in for cyber anti-mainstream media media Outlet

2269
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,392
From the UK

2270
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:08,000
They have an article that Greg Reese uses as a source of his video with the headline quote

2271
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:14,400
New UK Health Security Agency report proves without a shadow of a doubt that covid-19 vaccines do not work

2272
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:17,984
And have negative Effectiveness as low as minus 66

2273
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:18,752
Percent

2274
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,896
That's a big one so I figured I'd go and find this blog and see what they were working with

2275
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,944
Embrace video

2276
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
He shows up

2277
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:29,248
Particularly jarring spreadsheet

2278
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,528
From the blog post

2279
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,552
Which claims to be from

2280
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,832
Auk helps

2281
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:35,904
Security Agency report showing negative rates

2282
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,184
A vaccine effect

2283
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
Assure

2284
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:44,608
I go to the blog and the first thing that actually shocked me was that this post is actually arguing that getting vaccinated makes you

2285
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
More likely

2286
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,144
To get covid

2287
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,168
The negative

2288
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,192
Effectiveness is what

2289
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,216
That's how they are

2290
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
Describing it

2291
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
Is a

2292
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Big swing

2293
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,384
Very cuz it is hard not to go outside and say

2294
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,664
Well obviously that's not

2295
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,432
Rife

2296
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,504
This argument is based on a spreadsheet

2297
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,296
Which is labeled table 2

2298
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,576
From this a Chase

2299
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,856
Ihsa report

2300
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,184
The rightmost column of this spreadsheet is labeled

2301
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,720
Vaccine effective

2302
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:15,584
And it has numbers like - 85.71%

2303
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,352
For the group

2304
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,376
2 people between

2305
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,168
40 and 49 years old

2306
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:23,264
Would seem to really weird that does seem weird

2307
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,336
I found the actual HSA report that this came from

2308
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
I guess what

2309
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:28,896
This blog

2310
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:29,664
The vaccine

2311
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
Fitness column

2312
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,992
That's a

2313
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,296
Is made up and they photoshop to do this thing

2314
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,600
That they're presenting as a reference to this

2315
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,368
Official

2316
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,904
Okay that's what

2317
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,440
That's already fraud

2318
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:45,536
They're already deceiving by way of manipulating the information because they want you to think

2319
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,328
Think that this vaccine Effectiveness to test

2320
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
It's something that

2321
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,376
Hhsa track

2322
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,680
It's something that they thought was relevant

2323
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,216
Headache comes from official source

2324
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,008
Consumer something

2325
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,032
Then right

2326
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,056
Have you done

2327
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,104
I noticed something else there was a

2328
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
Quite right

2329
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:04,736
From top to bottom the version in the official report had eight rows of data

2330
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,784
But the version of must blog

2331
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,552
Only had sex

2332
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:11,648
Snow

2333
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:14,720
Deleted two rows of data

2334
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:21,120
Do this to me the information that was in those rows would have made it harder for them to lie

2335
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Here's what's going

2336
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,240
There are two primary columns that are relevant to this exit

2337
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,008
Explanation

2338
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,824
These are the rates per one of the covid rates

2339
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,152
It's per 100,000 people who are vaccinated versus those who are not

2340
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,944
What does block is done

2341
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,528
Mom is taking numbers of these columns and create their own staff

2342
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,064
You're taking me covid

2343
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,952
Case rate per 100,000 of vaccinated people and dividing it by the rate of people who are unvaccinated

2344
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:48,256
And then presenting that as a meeting.

2345
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,816
For some reason

2346
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:55,680
-85.71

2347
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,960
Percent Effectiveness rate

2348
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,984
4 people between

2349
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,264
40 + 49

2350
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:05,920
That was because they took the rate of 1281.8 per 100,000 which is the figure four

2351
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,712
Vaccinated people that age range

2352
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:11,552
Any / 690 point to just be rate of unpack

2353
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
Vaccinated people

2354
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
The result is one

2355
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,624
1.8

2356
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,904
571

2357
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:19,232
Which is how they got to their figure and it's completely meaningless as of today

2358
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:23,840
I mean no I remember it because when I was growing up Pythagoras

2359
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:25,376
I gave his famous

2360
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,680
Theory which is a squared plus b squared equals

2361
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,448
Gout

2362
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,008
However

2363
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:33,312
If you look at this meeting to statistics

2364
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:37,152
This helps explain why they deleted those two rows of data from the

2365
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,432
The spreadsheet before they post

2366
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Is it on their blog

2367
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:41,504
These worthy rates for the groups

2368
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,088
The people under 18 and those between 18 and 29

2369
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:51,232
People between 18 and 29 showed a significantly lower rate of cases among vaccinated people but

2370
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,792
The under-18 group was through the

2371
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:54,816
Kingroot

2372
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:56,864
People under 18 had a rate

2373
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,448
Of 278.8 / 100,000

2374
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,728
Among the vaccinated

2375
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:05,568
2320 5.7

2376
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:09,664
100000 among the unvaxxed

2377
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:16,064
You might have trouble dividing that into a way you can bulshit immediately you see how these datapoints would be

2378
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,088
Bia flight problem

2379
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,368
For the argument that this blog

2380
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:21,952
I was trying to make based on their weird calculation they did and presented Asana

2381
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,512
This would not be something they could

2382
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,584
Lion so they delete it and they pass the information along

2383
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:30,656
No need for the readers to see those datapoints it would

2384
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,728
Just make them question they would be confusing

2385
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:40,128
Confuse my readers they've come to me for Clarence B might have work for more information about what these numbers actually

2386
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:43,200
Captor then they'll find out that I created an entire column

2387
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
And deleted Road

2388
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:51,648
F****** b******* yeah that's really f***** up at super f*****

2389
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,416
Stop yep

2390
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,488
Cut out one other thing and that was a note that the

2391
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:58,304
Directly under the spreadsheet in the original post

2392
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,352
An HSA report which has closed

2393
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:05,728
Interpretation of the case rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated population is particularly susceptible

2394
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:08,800
Do changes in denominator and should be interpreted with

2395
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,080
Precaution

2396
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,872
This block did the exact

2397
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,408
Gregory's found

2398
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,456
Didn't look further into the data at all

2399
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:19,552
Episode

2400
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:20,576
Next year

2401
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,344
And that

2402
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,368
According to Alex

2403
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:24,416
Is the best work that he's ever done

2404
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,208
This is a team of

2405
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,232
Walking losers

2406
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,024
We are so bad at this

2407
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:35,680
You know it's not usual for the health Ministry to put out a study and then write you no like

2408
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:40,288
And we think these results should be interpreted with Reckless abandon

2409
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,568
In fact

2410
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,592
If you just

2411
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,896
Makeup bulshit whole-cloth out of these

2412
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:51,296
That's what we want you to do because the health Ministry do not have a great time

2413
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,064
Hey

2414
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,648
Happy hours on us

2415
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:59,232
I hope that that was

2416
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,000
Clear

2417
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:03,584
It's hard to describe a spreadsheet in a audio medium

2418
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,680
Yeah but I have screenshots of both of their version on the blog and

2419
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,704
Panther version

2420
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,984
From the HSA report

2421
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,776
And those will be up

2422
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,824
What are citations

2423
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
So Alex

2424
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:17,152
After playing is Gregory's report

2425
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
To recap the story

2426
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:27,136
All right ladies and gentlemen we are back into our number three and I'm just going to hammer through all the news.

2427
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:31,232
Eating around the edges of in the last 2 hours for you right now

2428
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,560
First off let's go back to where we began

2429
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,144
Official FDA letter that tells you that

2430
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,448
B5 Rashad is approved

2431
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:44,032
I says that in the year 2026 they met

2432
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,080
I showed you that

2433
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,360
Here is the document

2434
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:52,224
Letterman Alex exciting is that letter they sent her to approve their license

2435
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,016
To sell biological product over

2436
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:54,784
Thirsty Lion

2437
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:59,392
In addition to that included tentative time frames for when various studies about other questions

2438
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,416
Supposed Market effect

2439
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,696
Decide to be completed

2440
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:05,536
It is not in any way saying that the Pfizer vaccine will not be approved

2441
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:06,560
2026

2442
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,864
This is a fabrication of Alex not being able

2443
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,400
Understand things that he reads

2444
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:15,008
It's really simple back in August the FDA approved Pfizer vaccine for using people

2445
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,032
16 and older

2446
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,312
Generally just as a whole

2447
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:20,640
Additionally they extended the emergency use authorization

2448
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,176
For people between the ages

2449
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,200
12 + 15

2450
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,504
And that is pending a

2451
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,272
Full

2452
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,552
Authorization

2453
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,832
Right now we're starting

2454
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,880
Get the beta on this probably forthcoming

2455
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:32,672
He just doesn't understand how

2456
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,232
Things he does understand he's lying

2457
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:38,304
Auntie's particularly motivated to not understand us

2458
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:43,680
So he gets distracted from recapping all the Newsies covered because

2459
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:47,264
Kind of a recap of what's Happening

2460
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:58,272
We should all be walking around in sackcloth

2461
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,344
Can we

2462
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:06,720
Computer working

2463
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Answers all of this

2464
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:12,864
Really simple

2465
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,168
Corsola

2466
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,240
And then go out and warn everybody

2467
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:22,592
Not comply with the system but also point out that they're going to Stage false flag

2468
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:26,944
Start a physical Civil War

2469
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:32,576
Used to kill them so that some die

2470
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:43,328
A little girl and then that's it

2471
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,352
Really

2472
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:50,240
Emailed into these stories that he's been nibbling around the edges of or we've gotten distracted rambling about 4

2473
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:52,288
False flag making references to movie

2474
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:55,360
Right and very

2475
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,640
Poorly couched

2476
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,920
8 remember

2477
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,224
It's not going to be us committing all those terrorists tonight

2478
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:02,528
That is why they're going after the children

2479
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,552
To make us

2480
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,320
Commit terrorist

2481
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,624
It's not our fault

2482
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:09,440
It's definitely okay for us to come in Arizona

2483
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:12,768
Weather

2484
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:17,120
Did the terrorist act and if we are committed

2485
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:17,888
Don't like

2486
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,960
Question whether this whole world

2487
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:21,728
Open Spaces

2488
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:24,544
Is toxic and leads to things like

2489
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:31,200
I don't know blowing up an MRA

2490
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:34,272
Things it's the Gullah bus Volkswagen

2491
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,064
Is take stimulants

2492
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
Vickerman

2493
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:41,696
Because they clearly are super effective it help

2494
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,792
What a job he's doing you seen anyone do work

2495
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:50,400
This could not since Greg Reese

2496
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:58,848
Rambling about how they're going to be false flags and then made a reference

2497
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,152
2 V for Vendetta which distracted

2498
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920
Further

2499
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:08,320
And he has to play a clip from V for Vendetta brainforce Ultra shouldn't be more focused than ever

2500
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:09,088
You think

2501
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,768
Sbux

2502
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:19,328
That's my job and I'm honored to do it but I'm just telling you

2503
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,120
Jesus

2504
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,984
Come out and they announce

2505
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,752
That

2506
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,592
The children are going to take

2507
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,760
Back in 2026

2508
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:44,928
Shot heard round the world

2509
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,304
So as the recap continues Alex claims that he's shown the biking has a plan to forcibly vaccinate children

2510
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:56,704
Really trying hard to Brand as the shot heard round the world

2511
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,472
Do you know the shot

2512
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:03,872
Hot shot and then your reference don't even think he

2513
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
Not really

2514
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:07,200
Highlighting

2515
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:13,344
Disappointing process for people under 16 is moving forward in the United

2516
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,904
Midstate sanitizer release their preliminary data

2517
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,440
Chilling at the vaccine is effect

2518
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,208
Even younger people

2519
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,280
Alex also found an article from the UK about Houston

2520
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,072
Vaccinated but whose parent

2521
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,608
That's don't want them to camp

2522
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
Vaccinated

2523
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:30,752
The article is very explicit that no one is being forced to do anything so in this recap Alex's 042

2524
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:33,056
So now apparently there's going to be

2525
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,080
Troops

2526
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,104
That are going to be at the

2527
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,896
The schools vaccinating children

2528
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:45,088
Yeah at this point Ozark man you don't know the troops were resigning free cuz they're not taking the vaccine

2529
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,160
I think Alex has kind of lost the fur

2530
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,464
They are going to

2531
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:54,304
Come into the schools with military run clinics

2532
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,864
Martial law

2533
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:02,496
They are going to

2534
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:06,080
But they're saying it's those people

2535
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:13,504
If you twist somebody's arm into something that's coerce that's

2536
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:21,696
I mean it is there a law in the mafia says we'll burn down your grocery store if you don't pay a diction money

2537
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,232
They're going to burn it down

2538
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,120
Mafia

2539
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:31,680
Classic type

2540
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,240
The South

2541
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,544
South again

2542
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:38,336
Founded by Scotts

2543
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,408
Always killing each other and killing everybody else

2544
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,688
Turn acoustic

2545
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:43,968
UMass Lowell

2546
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:45,504
What are you talkin about

2547
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,528
Scott

2548
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:49,856
Braves versus working man

2549
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:55,232
You can't work if you fight back obviously the mafia's never survived after a

2550
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,256
Fight now

2551
02:06:56,512 --> 02:07:02,656
Also there's a big wing of the mafia in the New Orleans area and the trafficante crime family down in Tampa

2552
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:08,288
Actually connected to the larger Italian mafia there was also the Dixie Mafia in the south

2553
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,848
There's a lot of organized crime pretty much all over the

2554
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,616
The place of the United

2555
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:18,528
And the way his mind is working at this point the episode seems scary

2556
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:25,184
It doesn't have to be this organized crime but doesn't have to be the mafia

2557
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:29,280
I've organized crime well I mean the mafia is a hold

2558
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:33,120
F*** off but there were famous but there were plenty of

2559
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:36,704
Trampolines that had connections to the East Coast

2560
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,288
Crime families in the south

2561
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,104
Stop

2562
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:47,456
Because Alex is not f****** praying for. Make it home

2563
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,224
Made up

2564
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,760
Nonsense left and right

2565
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:50,528
If you're mad

2566
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,808
I want to reassure you some

2567
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
Alex is not going

2568
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,624
Wilcox

2569
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,928
The South again was

2570
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,208
By Scott

2571
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,232
Who

2572
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,560
Look for an excuse

2573
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,096
UMass Lowell

2574
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,680
What

2575
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,008
Play gentleman of the real American history

2576
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,288
Show

2577
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,848
That's where all this is going

2578
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:15,872
Ladies and gentlemen

2579
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,408
And

2580
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,176
It's on

2581
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,016
I want to get this one trillion percent clear

2582
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:29,696
Cops I'm not going to kill you cuz I'm going to kill the military or bureaucrats

2583
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,488
Portal swab or any of them

2584
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,840
Ugly will be sorted out by God

2585
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:41,728
They are going to Stage false Flags everything is set the stage is set at all prepared

2586
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,568
Because they're coming in our children with violence with death needle

2587
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,384
And they need to turn the issue around

2588
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,688
Say it's the

2589
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:56,064
Patriots that are terrorists that's why you the official policy of the US government

2590
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,088
Hijacked

2591
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:03,744
Protesting vaccine for lockdown terrorism

2592
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,024
Trenton

2593
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,328
Review the headlines of the day

2594
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,608
Yeah

2595
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,888
Pretty far afield

2596
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:11,680
Also

2597
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:13,216
I think he's wrong

2598
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:13,984
About

2599
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,336
No I mean in his own world you I think he's wrong

2600
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:20,640
Yeah if what he's saying is true

2601
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,200
Then he should absolutely go

2602
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,224
Who killed the president

2603
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:27,552
I don't understand how that doesn't make sense

2604
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,320
Listen

2605
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:31,392
If the government released a bio-weapon well then

2606
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:37,792
Just stop saying I'm not going to go kill anybody if the government released to buy a weapon and murdered millions of people

2607
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:41,888
Let me let me

2608
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:42,656
Perspective

2609
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:45,984
The puppet president killing them would not do any

2610
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,800
It wouldn't actually resolved

2611
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:54,432
It's it's morally okay in your own definition in his own definition yes but

2612
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:57,248
He can always Kick the Can down the road by saying like

2613
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,528
Know that person's just

2614
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,296
The figurehead

2615
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,832
Until you get to the devil

2616
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:07,232
And he would have carte blanche to kill the devil started the devil you know I mean do you know if you're tired

2617
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:10,304
The mafia you start low and then you try and get people to flip

2618
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:13,632
Kidnap Bill Gates see if he'll flip on the devil

2619
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:17,728
Plus Alex has the devil's power in his hands so he should be able to

2620
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:19,776
See everybody who is a demon

2621
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:26,176
Frankly there's only one true fight and that's between the two guys with the devil power and that's clearly Alex and the devil

2622
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:28,224
What can we all just get out of the way

2623
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:32,064
Classic archetypical battle between Alex Jones

2624
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:35,136
Beelzebub

2625
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:42,048
Wrestling with evil Alex has a bit of a. Here

2626
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:44,864
In the show where he's struggling with the effect

2627
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,400
Check the Trump sucks

2628
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:48,448
That's what I just keep trying to get to

2629
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,520
Is where the Congress where is Ron Paul

2630
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,544
We're Grandpa

2631
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,568
Eros

2632
02:10:55,872 --> 02:11:01,760
Trump I have the video I didn't play or stay at all if I was present still I can get the public to take the shots

2633
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,576
He means well

2634
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:08,160
He's proud of himself he thinks you did a good thing he said the damn shot

2635
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:09,696
Picture of crap

2636
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,304
Y'all want from Republican select

2637
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:16,352
Japanese a foursome good overall

2638
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,680
Diluting myself dead

2639
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:26,080
I mean

2640
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:29,152
Is so optimistic

2641
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,224
Believes in

2642
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:32,992
The guy that

2643
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
The idea of the secret

2644
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,064
Before

2645
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,112
Oprah Winfrey all them base what is happening

2646
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,768
Evie just be just

2647
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,584
But he got that off

2648
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:52,448
Let's move on from that huge story

2649
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:53,472
Sure

2650
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,008
I'm going to say this right now

2651
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,312
And this is

2652
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,336
I'm a maybe

2653
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,128
Maybe not 100%

2654
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:00,896
Treasure

2655
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:02,688
But 99% of the time

2656
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:07,296
If you proceed a statement with I'm not deluding myself

2657
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:09,088
And then follow that statement

2658
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:12,416
With repeating I'm not deluding myself you are

2659
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:14,208
Deluding yourself

2660
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,256
Also

2661
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,048
I think that this is drift

2662
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,584
Bring into cyborgs

2663
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,120
The three-wheel territory

2664
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:25,984
Worried like Alex desperately trying to come up with ways for Trump not to be evil

2665
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,032
Yeah he's complicit

2666
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:28,800
Because of his

2667
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:32,896
Pride and ego in something that will kill all of our children

2668
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:33,920
But he's a good guy

2669
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:35,712
Guy describe

2670
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:37,248
Is a man committing

2671
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,272
All of this in

2672
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,576
That I personally hate

2673
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,624
And then me justifying it

2674
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,648
Because I liked him

2675
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,464
But if anybody else that I've already

2676
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,744
You don't like does it

2677
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,768
They must be killed

2678
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,352
So there's a little bit of a stretch ear with things slow down

2679
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,120
A tiny bit

2680
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:54,912
It gets really boring

2681
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,704
And then Alex brings up

2682
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:04,640
More stuff about the military coming and shooting your kid show

2683
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,408
Information

2684
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,456
Message from the CDC

2685
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:12,576
Nosa Lawson regulation its considerations for planning School

2686
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:18,208
Located vaccine clinics coming into schools with the National Guard

2687
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:26,400
And you got to go read this thing I'm just reading this on here

2688
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,192
Incredible

2689
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:34,336
Especially the UN style come and take over the village make you take the shots

2690
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
And

2691
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,968
Talked about

2692
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
You need to get

2693
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,808
Talks about

2694
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:44,832
Reactions

2695
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:49,440
But people enforced

2696
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,768
Aniki is

2697
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,424
Develop

2698
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:03,520
Plan for use of electronic

2699
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:06,080
Registration Anwar consent system

2700
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,384
Rolling the children

2701
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,992
I don't know if it's fully coming across in this clip but altitude

2702
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:20,416
There was like 100 22 pretty fast

2703
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:26,560
Seems like he's crashing isn't so bad advertisement

2704
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:33,472
Is definitely a change in vibe

2705
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:36,288
Is pauses are becoming scary

2706
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,568
That NM

2707
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,336
Even his

2708
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:40,128
If he's not doing a good job

2709
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:44,224
Skating he's literally saying well the thing that the document I'm saying says

2710
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,016
It doesn't say that in the doctor but it's a

2711
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:48,320
And the thing that the document does say

2712
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
They're not doing

2713
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,368
Well don't report

2714
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,928
On the document if you're trying to report a

2715
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:57,280
If you're trying to report about the military in National Guard coming into

2716
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:00,608
Don't report on the something that doesn't say that

2717
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:04,192
Cuz this is just a CBC webpage that's about consideration

2718
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,216
Is that you should have

2719
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:05,984
Like if you

2720
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,264
You're going to set up a clinic

2721
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,312
Like a day of vaccinations

2722
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,592
Italy

2723
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:12,896
It legitimately just has like advice on how to

2724
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:14,176
Restore vaccine

2725
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,200
Get this

2726
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,480
It suggests

2727
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:19,808
But the day after you have a vaccination day haha

2728
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,624
Would consider sending thank you notes to volunteers

2729
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:25,696
Various ship man

2730
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:35,936
You should buy everyone pizza right

2731
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:37,472
James

2732
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:41,568
Same rules for helping somebody move you by a beef and beer afterwards

2733
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:47,968
Every race has been around for centuries that's how it works I got to say but not only my worry

2734
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,760
About Alex's energy at this point

2735
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:50,528
I'm worried

2736
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:53,600
Like this is just this is no good

2737
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,624
Thank you.

2738
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:56,672
Recommend

2739
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:58,720
Calligraphers

2740
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:01,024
Some of the Alex

2741
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,072
I would say in the past

2742
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:04,864
And his relationship with

2743
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:07,680
Students people who are under the age of eight

2744
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:08,704
18 weather there

2745
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:09,984
Victims of

2746
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
School shootings

2747
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:15,360
David Hogg

2748
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:20,224
For targeting children

2749
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,784
It doesn't go well remember

2750
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,576
That's what he's fighting to

2751
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,880
The children

2752
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:30,208
And so he's he's found another high-schooler that he's going

2753
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:30,976
Target

2754
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:35,072
What is the Judas goat will show you one

2755
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,352
Judas goat

2756
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,144
Does a train go

2757
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:41,984
Used at a slaughterhouse and in general an animal hurting

2758
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:45,568
But you discovered a train to associate with sheep or cattle

2759
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,128
Leading them to a specific destination

2760
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:52,224
In Stockyards a Judas goat will leave sheep to slaughter

2761
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:57,088
Well it's only the sprayer Judas goats are also used to lead other animals

2762
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,880
Just Pacific pens

2763
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:01,184
And or onto trash

2764
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,280
Judas

2765
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:11,680
Greta thunberg's

2766
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,216
I want to come back

2767
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:19,616
About Kelly

2768
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:26,784
Daniel poor woman come back with a Judas goat leading your children to go get the shots without telling you

2769
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:33,184
Will put a put a Target on a high-school sweetheart I really can't believe that

2770
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
It was

2771
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:36,000
What's something that I found

2772
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,024
Almost in defense

2773
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:39,584
0 people on a staff we're like hey

2774
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:42,656
Of all the things that you should not do

2775
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,936
And I'm not even talking

2776
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,704
Sing about like

2777
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,240
Just in the larger sense

2778
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:48,288
I'm just talkin about you

2779
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,568
Let's consider his

2780
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,640
Particular legal troubles that are going on right now

2781
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,944
Seems like this would be something that would

2782
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,992
Indicate a pattern of behavior

2783
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,576
Commence his audience to

2784
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:05,440
I don't know targeted Lee harass High School senior

2785
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,768
That's dat mean

2786
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:13,632
Irresponsibility bordering on an axe

2787
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
To physical violence

2788
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,448
From his staff

2789
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,544
He himself is far beyond

2790
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:24,384
Like that's that's just f***** up targeting that's f***** up but like

2791
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,944
It's it's negligence on the part of people around him

2792
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,224
That's f***** up

2793
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:31,552
So he doesn't get to talkin about this

2794
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:34,624
The high schooler for a while because he has to come back from break

2795
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,416
We can talk about how I can't you know you and me

2796
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,584
I wake up and I think I want to strangle you don't like the rest

2797
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,120
Get it

2798
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,656
Like you know we got

2799
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:48,448
Get it get it

2800
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,984
So now because we get it

2801
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:52,800
Outlook

2802
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,336
It's going to be bad

2803
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:55,872
Just like you

2804
02:18:57,664 --> 02:18:58,176
What's wrong

2805
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:00,224
That's that's what we are

2806
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:03,808
I'm asking myself what am I going to do

2807
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,368
Really you just be talking about

2808
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,672
Mitigating

2809
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,976
And saving ourselves

2810
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,304
Ourselves we can take care of others

2811
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,352
But has to be in that measure

2812
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:21,216
I guess I should go ahead and go through scenarios of what

2813
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,752
That is going to transpire

2814
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:25,312
There's only a few different paths We're Goin Down

2815
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:30,944
Absolute nightmarish horrible to just in the world

2816
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:32,224
He doesn't actually go through

2817
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,504
Through specific scenarios

2818
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:39,904
Getting kind of excited for a possible scenarios scenarios and

2819
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:43,232
One of them might be a really bad one if there was hitech

2820
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:49,632
Technology anti-fascism in one might be a low technology looks

2821
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:54,240
Four scenarios exactly I think that would be really interesting

2822
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:57,056
It would be fun if one of them was just

2823
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,848
Vampires

2824
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,920
One of them Dragon one of them dragons

2825
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:08,320
One of them is Godzilla real

2826
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:11,136
Got to go with the dragon

2827
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:14,208
Vampires

2828
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:16,256
That should also include all Undead

2829
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:19,072
So zombies and vampires scenario

2830
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:24,192
Worldwide squid game 1 squid game to end them all

2831
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:26,496
Yes

2832
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:33,152
That's probably scenario 3304 is a worldwide

2833
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,176
Agreement is put in

2834
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,456
Good place for a minimum

2835
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:38,016
From corporate tax I was going to go with

2836
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:40,064
Murder Hornets take over the land

2837
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:46,464
Breaking news

2838
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,792
Information set

2839
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,096
Fauci

2840
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:53,632
Project

2841
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:57,472
Project Developers

2842
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:58,752
That's all come out

2843
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:02,592
My dad knew that the mid-eighties Smurfs around the table talking about it

2844
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,944
You know all the people you know them all

2845
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:08,736
But don't work for the

2846
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:09,760
Deputy see eye-to-eye

2847
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,064
And

2848
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,368
I told him all that stuff

2849
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:21,024
Alex HIV

2850
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,560
I'm talking about this

2851
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:25,376
The Alex is known the factory was evil except for

2852
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:27,424
When Steve pieczenik said that.

2853
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,192
Ouchi was a

2854
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:29,984
Great

2855
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,520
And Alex

2856
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:34,080
First started talking about you and said

2857
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:37,664
He done the research on him and he was a hero he was one of the best

2858
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:38,944
Because he thought

2859
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,248
That he was siding with Trump on

2860
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,272
Some stuff and then

2861
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,808
Dot-dot-dot drop really fast

2862
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:47,648
Alex had known since childhood

2863
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,416
I would think

2864
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:49,440
But that would have been something

2865
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:55,840
The moment that his name Papa yeah I mean certainly went Steve is like I went to college with him

2866
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:56,864
Galaxy be like

2867
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,632
What

2868
02:21:57,888 --> 02:22:01,728
Yeah yeah I know that

2869
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:07,616
Maybe your dad's a liar.

2870
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:11,200
This is just a tangential nonsense

2871
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,224
I was just kind of

2872
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,528
Concerned that Rand Paul isn't stepping up

2873
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:20,672
And he needs to risk his life over this s*** I'm excited to know that everyone is pretty

2874
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:25,536
Pretty certain that none of our Senators are f****** stepping up and especially Rand Paul is

2875
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,072
The coward

2876
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:33,984
See how they win

2877
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:37,824
See how they do that cuz you're in trouble we're going to win

2878
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:40,640
I already thought that through

2879
02:22:42,688 --> 02:22:45,248
Unless senator Paul Rand Senator Hawley all of them

2880
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:48,832
Come out and say Klaus Schwab Bill Gates only be arrested

2881
02:22:57,024 --> 02:23:01,888
Paul them won't go all the way closed

2882
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:05,216
Sapori to Biggby

2883
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:09,824
Police

2884
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:11,616
You know Paul was the main target

2885
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,152
Baseball game

2886
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:14,432
I'll kill him in a debate

2887
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:18,016
You don't think that guy just broke

2888
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:25,184
But he's just going to have to stop and get ready to die

2889
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:35,424
He's our best shot

2890
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:38,752
And that's why they're all

2891
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:49,504
And that's why they now.

2892
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:56,928
Judges saying you don't even get a trial you don't even get a jury we're just going to rule this until you know shut your business down I mean

2893
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:58,976
Thinking of the business

2894
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,024
And

2895
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,376
You just targeted a high-schooler

2896
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,144
Yeah

2897
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:08,960
Why are you this this is such a rambling defense

2898
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:10,240
As for why he lost

2899
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,312
Yeah

2900
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:16,128
Yeah and how dare you say rampaul is going to die

2901
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,432
Before he debates me sure

2902
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:22,784
Sure he has plot armor

2903
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:26,624
Is the main character in

2904
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:31,744
This is a man everything is just jumping around here but

2905
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,048
Two pretty violent

2906
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:37,888
Sort of ideation that he has this fantasy about like well

2907
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:41,472
Some people are going to have to die rampaul you got to get ready to die

2908
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:42,240
Like

2909
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:46,592
It does sometimes feel like

2910
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:49,920
Like it's just a man screaming like I don't belong here

2911
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:52,224
I don't know where I belong

2912
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:55,296
I mean 88 feels like he's just like

2913
02:24:55,808 --> 02:25:00,416
Everything isn't the way I wanted and that's and that's his only only

2914
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:03,232
I belong in a

2915
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:10,656
That he has complete control over

2916
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,936
Everybody is

2917
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:13,472
Fervently extremist

2918
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:17,056
Fundamentalist Christian

2919
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:17,824
Oh man

2920
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,360
So look

2921
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,128
People have to die

2922
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:20,896
In order to

2923
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:24,480
Mom anything alright

2924
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,648
Don't do it

2925
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:34,464
We also have some good

2926
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:38,048
Wait till you hear with a good news

2927
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:45,472
The men are going to have to be willing to die stopped

2928
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:50,848
The Federal Building

2929
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:53,152
Don't do that appointment don't worry

2930
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:54,944
You got to be willing to pick

2931
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:58,272
Speak out and it would go to state houses and

2932
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:02,624
The best news I've heard in a long time and it is what's really going to say

2933
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:06,976
Be careful how I tell this because it's

2934
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,560
It's incontinence and nnn so I'll just leave it like

2935
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:18,496
Confirm that ABC News in CNN and other places

2936
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,032
Dad

2937
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:22,080
People's wives mainly are

2938
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:23,104
Believing your husband

2939
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:28,736
Family members are

2940
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:35,392
Brothers going you know show up like 50 year old men beat their run around cuz you know they're on TV

2941
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:42,304
Families are taking this very very serious

2942
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,584
I'm trouble

2943
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:45,888
People who work at the media

2944
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:48,704
Didn't didn't demand murder his family

2945
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,496
Because of the vet

2946
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:51,264
Because he thought

2947
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,032
That they were

2948
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:52,800
Yeah

2949
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:55,104
That's what Alex is good news

2950
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:56,384
No I don't think

2951
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,920
I hope

2952
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,712
That's not what he's talkin

2953
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:06,112
Yeah but it sounds almost suspiciously similar like

2954
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,928
And beat the s*** out of his brother that's way you know what

2955
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:15,328
Different from murdering I honestly forgot about that story I just thought like I don't know somebody

2956
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:22,240
Somebody who works for stelter got divorced or something in this is Alex's like

2957
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:24,032
That's f***** up

2958
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:29,152
Yeah I think you might as well have it yet that's it if that's his good news it's just a matter of degree differ

2959
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,432
Could have just been like

2960
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:36,832
It's good news I heard that a man murdered his family because he didn't want them to be controlled by the vaccine or whatever

2961
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:42,976
Honestly I'm a little on my heels here because I haven't forgotten about that

2962
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:47,072
Clip-on way more chilling

2963
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:48,352
Chilling clips

2964
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:50,400
That I've heard on his show in a while

2965
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:55,520
Brothers going no show up like that year old men beat their brother up cuz you know they're on TV

2966
02:27:57,568 --> 02:27:59,872
Families are taking this very very serious

2967
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:03,968
I leave that at the family's what you do with your family

2968
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:08,320
Teenager my dad said if you turn evil I'm going to kill you and I know he was serious about it

2969
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:09,856
Almost

2970
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:13,440
Number

2971
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:15,232
This is a family affair

2972
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:20,352
You know who you live with you know what they've done

2973
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:29,056
I'm just simply saying that in in in this type of War

2974
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:35,456
That's the type of wheelhouse rendering

2975
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:39,296
I was

2976
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:41,856
Pretty much speechless after I heard

2977
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:44,672
What are the things that I think is really interesting

2978
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,440
Is

2979
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,464
I played

2980
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:50,048
Piece of that at the beginning of this as a novel context dropped

2981
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:50,816
Kind of funny

2982
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:53,120
Yeah but then you listen to it in context

2983
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:55,424
I don't know how you could

2984
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:01,824
Could hear that any other way than Alex Surah saying it might be okay for you to kill your family

2985
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,616
We're at the situation of like

2986
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:06,176
Not this man is is

2987
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,200
Bad this is

2988
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,992
This means to be stopped

2989
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:11,040
This needs to be

2990
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,576
That's f****** insane

2991
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:19,488
I don't think you can hear that is anything other than a

2992
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:20,512
Insertive

2993
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:21,536
A tenuous Justice

2994
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,304
Application

2995
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,584
Or is it hey

2996
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:27,936
I don't judge what you do within your family if that thing is murder

2997
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,472
F****** dare

2998
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,752
How dare you

2999
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:32,544
F****** say that there

3000
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,592
They're going to start a civil war

3001
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:37,920
And then tell people that it's okay to murder members of their

3002
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:42,528
In the same time f****** real on the same

3003
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:47,904
Cast be preoccupied with the machinations of the literal devil

3004
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:48,928
Brand

3005
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:52,256
Giving vaccines to Children the shot heard around the world

3006
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,536
Yeah it's

3007
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,816
It's all just

3008
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:55,840
TaylorMade

3009
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:57,120
Tubi

3010
02:29:57,376 --> 02:30:01,472
Dangerous and create the situation that he's pretending to be against

3011
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:02,496
I have

3012
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,776
Come to pass

3013
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:08,128
I mean yeah not function with

3014
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:08,896
Alex

3015
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,736
It just

3016
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:17,088
I have faith

3017
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,112
Okay

3018
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:20,160
I may be naive

3019
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:24,768
But I believe in your help as well but look if there were people like Alex we wouldn't have

3020
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,792
Have Clips like this

3021
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,840
Deliciously stupid

3022
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:30,400
Some dogs are stupid some dogs are smart

3023
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:35,776
This is a phenomenon has been seen and now before

3024
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:40,128
It actually happened some in Nazi Germany

3025
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:43,712
German Shepherd

3026
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,736
Children

3027
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:50,880
German Shepherds again neither male have a maternal instinct

3028
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:52,160
Why would you kill

3029
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:53,440
Why would you hurt small person

3030
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,232
What is a person doing

3031
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,560
Dog thinks it's a human

3032
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,864
Takes the dishes in a pack

3033
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:05,216
Dog sauce might steal some food from you or

3034
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:13,664
But if you're just beating people up for no reason the dog doesn't see Justice in that

3035
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,456
Attack

3036
02:31:15,712 --> 02:31:17,504
Kylie

3037
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:25,696
I know that you're taking Jake to dog training

3038
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:35,168
Does this dog trainer have a big idea to put on have specifically

3039
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:36,960
Point out that

3040
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:38,240
Jake

3041
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:40,544
Was a Buddhist

3042
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,616
Has been

3043
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:45,664
Spending too much time trying to do

3044
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,712
Detached from the rest of us

3045
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:48,992
Enough said his

3046
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:49,760
Is dog scent

3047
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:51,552
Suggested out of whack

3048
02:31:51,808 --> 02:31:54,880
Sure and hear you got to you got to worry about like

3049
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:55,904
If your dog

3050
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:58,208
I don't know how it would

3051
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:03,840
Articulate this but it might believe in like the categorical imperative might be more of a utilitarian

3052
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,888
IBEW don't like you don't know what

3053
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:07,424
What standards of ethics

3054
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,752
Your dog is going to jeans and let's go even a step further

3055
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:16,128
How does my dog feel about civil forfeiture that's what I need to know

3056
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:19,712
The Justice in that will my dog attack somebody for

3057
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:20,736
I know that

3058
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:27,136
Police dogs having to Town police for trying to take me to class at the last for

3059
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,160
That sounds right

3060
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:32,512
The only logic I can come to you

3061
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:35,328
Looks so dumb

3062
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:36,608
I think just said

3063
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:37,632
Hey look

3064
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:40,704
That fux with a dog sense of justice

3065
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:43,520
If you go beat somebody up your dog's not going to like it

3066
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:47,872
The dog sees that person steal your food beforehand

3067
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:50,688
It'll know that it's cool to be that person up

3068
02:32:50,944 --> 02:32:52,992
What happens when you build your love

3069
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:55,040
Bread of knowledge around lore

3070
02:32:55,296 --> 02:33:01,440
You're just over yeah well I mean obviously if you take them out and you put them under the Wonder after a full moon he becomes

3071
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:05,024
The same person who believes

3072
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,328
This kind of stuff is not the person

3073
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:09,632
Listen to about whether or not it's okay to kill your fam

3074
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:10,400
My God

3075
02:33:11,424 --> 02:33:13,216
My f****** god

3076
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:18,080
We're getting towards the end of this this is another thing that is

3077
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:19,360
Pleasanton

3078
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:22,944
Upsetting really bad job

3079
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,992
This high schooler of not trying to put a tarp

3080
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,784
How

3081
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
Do

3082
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:28,832
We stopped

3083
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:32,672
From attacking us but not get Violet back

3084
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:35,232
So they can destroy civilization

3085
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:38,048
Destroyed anyway so so

3086
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:41,632
Then what's going on

3087
02:33:43,168 --> 02:33:46,240
So I let me tell you about

3088
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:51,104
Said no to their kids

3089
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:56,224
She created a resource where people who wanted to get vaccinated and they had Parents

3090
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:58,272
Two or maybe into qanon or

3091
02:33:58,528 --> 02:33:59,552
Some kind of an antiviral

3092
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,832
Text believe fry could

3093
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:04,672
Find the resources to find a shot if they wanted to

3094
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:07,488
And we're responsible enough and we're doomed

3095
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:08,512
An okapi

3096
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:10,816
Didn't have to make her own decisions in whatever

3097
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,840
State or city

3098
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:14,912
They happened to be an ad now Alex is talking

3099
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:15,680
In about

3100
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:16,704
You know

3101
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,520
Hey look how do we do this without getting violent

3102
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:22,848
Also they're going to destroy civilization anyway

3103
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:26,688
Wallpaper

3104
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,712
That's like

3105
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:32,064
What it what did you find her daughter's looking at the website like but hate my dad

3106
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,600
That's f****** Alex Jones

3107
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,904
Clearly I have the ability to make

3108
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:36,928
Decision for myself

3109
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,208
But he cannot

3110
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:41,024
Yeah so I would say

3111
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,072
The alot of this show has been

3112
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:43,840
Crash

3113
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:45,376
Nothing has happened

3114
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:48,960
No very little actual

3115
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:55,616
Bits of meat on the bone hopefully rambling Alex having a little freak outs him being on a

3116
02:34:56,128 --> 02:34:58,688
Energy roller coaster

3117
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,480
You know real weird

3118
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:06,880
Taking his turboforce herb rainforests and getting like real

3119
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:08,160
Everything slows down

3120
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:09,952
He did not do a good job

3121
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:13,024
This is why I

3122
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:18,400
One stack we've covered the last.

3123
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,776
Before watching takes over

3124
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:25,824
In the next 45 minutes.

3125
02:35:26,848 --> 02:35:27,360
Wow

3126
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:30,688
What are professional

3127
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:36,576
Be busy beaver I probably going to be on for room some to it is much that I need to get to this is breaking right now

3128
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:37,856
Shepherd

3129
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:45,280
Formula that has the level of any brand that we know that existed

3130
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:47,584
Strongest

3131
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:53,984
I still good for information so that your body is back in stock 40% off ship No Time didn't get to the news

3132
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,008
And he did not get

3133
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:58,848
Get to a whole stack

3134
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:02,944
You got to maybe he's giving a couple headlines getting mad about the devil

3135
02:36:03,456 --> 02:36:05,248
Putting a Target on a high schooler

3136
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:09,600
Telling people maybe it's okay to kill your family's

3137
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:11,392
Floating Gregory's for doing

3138
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,416
Terrible work

3139
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:14,208
It's not if you do it

3140
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:17,280
Look if you're an Infowars listener you believe in

3141
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,304
All kinds of bull

3142
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:20,096
Get that

3143
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:22,400
I would feel personally insulted

3144
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:25,472
But Alex isn't taking this seriously

3145
02:36:25,984 --> 02:36:30,080
Tune in to your job I would feel as an Infowars listener not like

3146
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:33,664
How dare you say all of these awful things I would feel like man

3147
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:38,528
You're literally not stepping up you just told f****** Rand Paul is it

3148
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:41,344
To die for you and you can't even

3149
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,368
Prepare

3150
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:48,000
You just get drunk the night before and then ramble about how I should murder people for 3 hours

3151
02:36:48,256 --> 02:36:50,304
And you expect me to follow you

3152
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:52,352
Yeah there's a part of me that

3153
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:58,496
Momentarily I'll feel that way you know like you don't even take this seriously and I

3154
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:00,288
Covering your s***

3155
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,568
I think that the

3156
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:03,360
Deserve a psychodrama that he's

3157
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:05,152
Clearly going through on this episode is

3158
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:06,432
Is interesting

3159
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,200
There is something

3160
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:07,968
Compelling about it

3161
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:12,832
Content-wise

3162
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:14,112
I understand

3163
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:15,648
I was meeting.

3164
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:20,512
Twomad really offended

3165
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,304
By the even the six

3166
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,072
Just Jim

3167
02:37:23,584 --> 02:37:24,608
Of killing your family

3168
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,888
I am

3169
02:37:26,144 --> 02:37:26,656
Boggled

3170
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:27,936
That you could

3171
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:31,520
Just to hear somebody say that and not go like well obviously he died

3172
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:33,312
Guys are the worst human being in the world

3173
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:34,080
Yeah

3174
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:35,616
Yeah II

3175
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:39,200
I often speak a little bit like

3176
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:43,040
This is one of the craziest things I've heard or whatever but like

3177
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:46,368
I mean it about that that clip is one of the most chilling things

3178
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,904
But I think I've heard him

3179
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:48,672
Suggest

3180
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:51,744
Maybe the entire time I've done this podcast

3181
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,840
What's let's get rid of any and all critical thought

3182
02:37:57,888 --> 02:37:58,400
From the star

3183
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:00,448
Okay here's here's my first

3184
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:05,056
Step for you whatever information out that you are going to alright

3185
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:08,640
There are people who will tell you to kill your family

3186
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:11,712
And there are people who will tell you not to kill your family yeah

3187
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:13,248
And there are people who are

3188
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,016
Agnostic

3189
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:17,600
The people in the middle only trust people who tell you not to

3190
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:18,880
Kill your family

3191
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:26,560
You can start looking into

3192
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:27,328
Family

3193
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:30,144
This isn't the Spectrum problem

3194
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:36,032
It's somewhere in the middle is the line

3195
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:39,872
How in favor of killing your family should be

3196
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:44,480
Do a lot of people are like Jordan sometimes you take things into a black-and-white

3197
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:48,064
So black-and-white sometimes things are just black and white

3198
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:53,440
This qualifies as dude

3199
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:57,792
We do have a website

3200
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,840
Please don't kill your family. Com

3201
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:01,632
Sandollar stripe.com

3202
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:06,240
And like I said I'll have those screenshots up

3203
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:19,296
Dan Illinois

3204
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,320
What the sex robot

3205
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:25,440
Alex

3206
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:28,256
Birthstone colors
