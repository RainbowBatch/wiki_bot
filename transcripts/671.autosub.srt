3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
The altar of Celine talk a little bit

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,216

8
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008

Back

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
So here's the

13
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Situation

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,992
You can't eat any more f****** muster

15
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
Well

16
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
Terrible news

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
In preparation for the year of the mustard

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
I ordered the number of mustard

19
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,264
Yes you did

20
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
I don't like mustard

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,528
Mustard mustard

22
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,648
The number is yellow mustard a little bit too boring and playing but it's right like them might like

23
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
I have like

24
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Some of them that I got

25
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
Way to DeShawn

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Calculation with fairy off

27
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
What's a good ice

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Being bigger than your stomach is I think a feature not a bug

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Good ones that I cried and now at the batting average is atrocious and I can't imagine doing it alright

30
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,672
So I'm calling off yeah yeah I think that's wise I think that's wise

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
There is big news we are replacing it

32
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Your the mustard out the window

33
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
God but now you know what we're doing what are we doing

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
The dreamy creamy summer

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Okay

36
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Alright

37
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
Ice cream novelties

00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
Ice cream Novelties doing it for the summer dreamy creamy creamy creamy summer

Dreamy creamy

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
It's going to be the best

42
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,256
That'd be great so starting on Ford 2600 till 9/11

43
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
420 2911 Coronavirus

44
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,336
11 more details about what this will entail on the next episode

45
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Much easier to complete in a positive way for sure

46
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Good mustards if you'd like

47
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
To send me a message I will

48
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,208
Certainly repay you

49
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Or make you something that I don't know we'll do something for you because it's a very generous

50
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
If you feel short-changed by the year of the mustard please and not Our intention at all

51
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
I just hope we can transition that into

52
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Enthusiasm about the dreamy creamy summer

53
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
Well I think ultimately you know

54
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Wait

55
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Game might be an issue for the dreamy creamy Summers

56
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
Think I'm going to have to try to make sure I don't

57
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Go to far

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Honestly

59
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
I don't think I eat all that healthy to begin with that is true that big

60
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,799
But we went at 8 here's what we do we do this like like the McDonald's

61
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Is everyday for 30 days

62
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
You're going to need to go to a dentist regularly like

63
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,735
Once a week check-ups how much ice cream have you eaten this week

64
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Six-in-ten drink

65
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,391
Fortnite you don't like that guy just go to a chiropractor who pretends to be a dentist

66
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Chiropractor who pretends to be a doctor

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
And a dentist

68
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Chiropractor

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
I think it's a good way to go

70
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
So

71
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567

00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

150
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

151
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
And you never see me again

152
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Really what I want to do

153
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

154
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

155
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
I'll be better tomorrow

156
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
He's not he's not much better

157
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
I don't think that this was as

158
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Toxic and episode is I've heard must her for Alex at this point

159
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
I mean it yeah I don't think I wanted to rage quit at any point

160
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Okay

161
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,151
Bored at many points

162
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
For something outside of what

163
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
Possible so I think at Alex's position

164
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
Achievable goals such as not forcing you to rage

165
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
There might be a me like top

166
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,839

So we start off the episode and to Alex's covering

175
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
UB Subway shooting in New York

176
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
That is a kind of the big news

177
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
You got to take

178
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Incredible story

00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,751

00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
White

183
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Because she believed I needed to die

184
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Also wanted to kill black people

185
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Married outside

186
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Bloodline

187
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Obviously completely mentally ill

188
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
This morning

189
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
Totally off base here but there is a couple of important

190
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
Distinctions that need to be made between what Alex is saying and what information is known

191
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
It is true that the alleged Subway shooter Frank James had a history of posting disturbing off and hateful

192
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
And violent videos on YouTube

193
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:37,855
You have a serious problem with New York's Public Health System particularly be mental health system having claimed that he was mistreated

194
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
The city facility

195
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
He also did have some just taste for white

196
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
But Alex is conveniently leaving out the racist yet he post about

197
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Many other group

198
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Including black

199
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
That being said it's pretty clear from his videos that he was strongly opposed to white people he was worried about a coming race war and was my

200
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Mentally unwell

201
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
And he was mad at

202
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Kentucky Brown jacks

203
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Send because she's married to a white man

204
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Alex is referring to their

205
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
However there are

206
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
These distinctions that are important

207
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,367
This is a very possible motivation for shooting and it may well turn out that's

208
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
McKay's but Alex doesn't know that when he

209
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
He's reporting this is option that Alex is making

210
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
And

211
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Whether he was

212
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Motivated by a racial hatred

213
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
It doesn't mean that he was trying to kill white people in the subway

214
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
It is there's a meaning to it although it's

215
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Maybe slightly I could

216
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
The I understand I understand what you say

217
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
The second point is probably more important you can see that when there's a black shooter who appears to be motivated by hate

218
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
People ideology

219
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
They're making decisions

220
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
And they are actual

221
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,791
Compare this to the way that Alex covers countless white Mass Shooters like dylann roof or James Holmes

222
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Clear distinction

223
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
When the shooters white there's a g

224
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Conspiracy about how we was brainwashed

225
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
Basically just a blunt instrument being used by the globalist

226
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,567
Spotify shooter is not white it may be some kind of a conspiracy still they made

227
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Maybe not well

228
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
Control over their racks

229
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
There's a reason that they're doing what they're doing

230
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Yes it motivates our Acts

231
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Supposed to like

232
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
They were

233
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,903
Jolyon West brainwashed him at an Air Force facility or whatever

234
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Just ghetto

235
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,023
Sing out loud you can judge this person as bad

236
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
You cannot judge

237
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
The white person

238
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Miss bad because they're at

239
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
Actions we're outside of their control

240
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Exact

241
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,591
The 3.0 bring up is that Alex was just making up an idea that the media is covering up Frank James

242
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Previous social media releases

243
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
On this very day of this episode April 13th

244
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
There was an article in the New York Times titled quote sucked suspect drifted from city-to-city as his videos hinted at violin

245
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
This Times article offers a more nuanced perspective on James videos and how he wasn't just someone who hated white people

246
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
The only thing that's important

247
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Alex so that's how Infowars report

248
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
They compared to this from the time

249
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Quotes

250
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
He seems to have been more Focus

251
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
Just on his YouTube account where the video is he post

252
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Devolved into outburst

253
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Homophobia misogyny

254
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
And offensive comments about people

255
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,551
Mr. James was black directed much of his hatred towards people who

256
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
Name for the way they were treated in the United States

257
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
The article goes on to say quote

258
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
He expressed admiration for black Trailblazers like Martin Luther King Jr President Barack Obama but Unleashed vitriol

259
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
What other black people including Dante right

260
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
Who was killed by a police officer in Minnesota last

261
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
Here and other young black men shot by the police

262
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,847
He blamed them for their own death saying you play stupid games Win stupid prizes

263
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
And adding that they deserve

264
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
To be shot yeah that's so

265
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Turn from what Clarence Thomas

266
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Believe or Alex

267
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
There was a big article about the videos and a social media Post in Rolling Stone and it's a story that was covered in countless other Outlet

268
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
The point here is that they're absolutely was no desperate cover-up of the subject matter and it's important to understand what Alex means what

269
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
He says that

270
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Went out to Ledger the cover up what he saying is that other outlets don't at the same angle on the story that he doesn't anyone who's narrative is

271
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Is different than Alex is covering something up

272
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,383
So when Alex says that there was a shooting there was entirely and centrally around a hater

273
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
White people

274
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
If you're a listener

275
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
And you encounter another Outlet.

276
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
Discussing the broader hatred and anger James's traffic again

277
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,391
You'll be far more likely to see that is the media trying to blur the real truth of the story

278
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Alex is Reporting Act

279
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,327
It look they're trying to both sides it they're trying to make it look like oh this isn't just about how much

280
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Much he hates white

281
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,703
People and by extension because as obviously we know

282
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
You can paint an entire group by the X

283
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Actions of one individual

284
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Especially one who is incredibly mentally unwell

285
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
This is another critical aspect of Alex's early game

286
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,319
When their stories breaking and there aren't a lot of concrete details known about the situation he'll pretty much always accuse

287
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
A nun specific group

288
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
Like the idea of the gauges

289
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
A cover-up

290
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
It never actually has two

291
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
To be true because the effect he's looking

292
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Emporia's to make the audio

293
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
Distrustful of any story that doesn't match his narrative

294
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,471
And warning of some imaginary cover-up does that perfectly well it doesn't have to have any bearing on reality

295
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
Also there's just a Trope among races

296
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,871
My black crime was being covered up while white crime is over reported now it says

297
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
Definitely playing that game here too

298
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Totally

299
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
That sucks

300
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Introductory pieces

301
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
It is a little bit wild to hear Alex

302
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
Alex's take on that when there is a I mean

303
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
You can

304
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Pool if you put transcripts

305
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,351
Alex videos in that guy's videos

306
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
There are plenty of situations where you would be able to tell who said what

307
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Maybe there's

308
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Optics differences and turn right

309
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
The way things are being expressed

310
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
James in his videos was

311
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
You're so concerned about upcoming race war Alex and his guests

312
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,623
Talk about that all the goddamn time

313
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
So

314
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
What you going to do

315
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
I think that Alex thinks that he's taking a little bit of a moral High Ground here by being like we don't blame Alba

316
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Black people for the

317
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
The shooter who was black rights

318
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Okay cool

319
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Blaine black

320
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
People for what he did

321
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
We don't blame someone for the color of their skin

322
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Somebody else

323
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
The same skin

324
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Has done

325
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
Completely

326
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Also mumbling in

327
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Incoherently

328
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,767
What do you want into an innocent black church and killed nine people at point-blank range in

329
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
White person in America was guilty

330
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
And every gun owner was guilty the corporate

331
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
4 months

332
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Betus

333
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
We don't blame white p

334
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
People for what they

335
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Stopping me shooters

336
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,159
Really funny for Alex to pretend that he hadn't evolved response to the Dylan roof shooting

337
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
His immediate response was that a proof wanted to actually kill black

338
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
People you should have become an abortion doctor which isn't saying about Frank James

339
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Why people you should have become an abortion doctor

340
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
Don't white people get abortion. Guess it doesn't seem that Alex

341
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Would really think of it though

342
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,895
When the victims are racially Target

343
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,783
Imports on reporting from 2015 actually undercuts Alex's entire Point here

344
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,855
Snowmass blaming of white people for rusacks

345
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,951
There was a deep trauma that have been caused by a personal Act

346
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
It specifically out of racist hate

347
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,583
Had a conversation was needed about how that hate is more prevalent than most people want to admit

348
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
And this is where

349
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
8 leaves a lot of

350
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
The time

351
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
When I say that in pores on reporting contradict Alec

352
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,799
What I mean is that just after the shooting Alex Jakari Jackson

353
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Come down to Charleston

354
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
Expecting to find chaos

355
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
And people fighting

356
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
Spouting is normal race war fears

357
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
But when Jakari got there he found a community coming together

358
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,415
To heal people of all ages races and backgrounds and supporting each other here's a clip from his report

359
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Doubts about

360
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
11:40

361
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
He also had loud

362
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Inside there

363
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
And

364
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
It whether you were inside or outside who is

365
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Pretty hot

366
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
I don't know if they

367
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
They didn't have one but

368
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Bobby Webb and water

369
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
But it still good until we are

370
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
And they're sweating

371
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
But everybody

372
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Enjoying the service

373
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
It was

374
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
It was a lot of

375
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Asian worship

376
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Goodbye

377
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Keep saying about this

378
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
People law

379
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Colors

380
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
She's All That

381
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,047
You will not be surprised to learn that Dakari didn't do too much more reporting

382
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,935
Charleston because of community coming together to reject racism and show that they're stronger than the hate that motivated dylann roof

383
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
That's not a story

384
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
It's very interesting for Infowars

385
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
Not profitable

386
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Also f***

387
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
The idea of having arm pastor

388
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
When that's something you're sincerely suggesting you need to stop a minute and consider the problem what may be way more serious than your acting

389
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Like it is

390
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,855
It's bad enough that rhetoric around arming teachers is

391
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,439
Become so normalize the idea that religious leaders

392
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Painfully depressing

393
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
But it seems to be missing the mark entirely

394
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,655
It just feels like Alex wants to live in a world that's basically just that LP video for Deep Space 9 m m

395
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:29,055
Just casually pointed guns at each other everybody else all the time

396
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
808

397
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
It'll do something

398
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
The most high-profile case

399
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,783
I think Alex could be referring to here is the Sutherland Springs Church shooting back in 2017

400
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,879
Stop by an armed Deacon or somebody in the congregation being armed

401
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,719
Stephen willeford was a guy who shot the shooter there and he was at home

402
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
When the shooting started

403
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
He only responded after his daughter told him that she'd her

404
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
Heard gunshots only came to the church but it wasn't

405
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
An armed preacher

406
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,727
In 2021 an armed man took over a church pulpit in Nashville

407
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
Pastor in that case was able to disarm him

408
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Didn't use a gun

409
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
Pastor does tackled him from behind before he was able

410
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
The shoot anyone

411
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
In that case I would suspect that if the gunman had been

412
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
Confronted by someone with another gun

413
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,111
You would end up putting a ton of churchgoers in a much more dangerous position and where

414
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
They could end up being

415
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Exchange of Fire

416
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
People could be shot

417
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Accidentally

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Preacher might accidentally shoot one of your

419
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Aggregation

420
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
It's not a solution to the problem

421
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
It's Alex's solution

422
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
There it would be it would be very hard

423
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
4A

424
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
A

425
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Pastor

426
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Or priest

427
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Of the like

428
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Who believes

429
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
What they believe

430
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Sincerely

431
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
2

432
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,320
I want to kill somebody

433
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
As opposed to lay down their own life

434
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Right

435
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
I mean like you would rather a pastor

436
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
Would rather be killed

437
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
To save the murderers life

438
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Then otherwise

439
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Is the point

440
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
Situation

441
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Because of this

442
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,360
Happening in there was a case of a pastor can't remember where

443
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
But he gave a sermon

444
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,736
And then he went to a Wal-Mart and there was a shooter any ended up

445
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Having a gun

446
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Shooting the shooter

447
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
So is Pastor shooting

448
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
A guy with a gun

449
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
The church so I didn't

450
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
But who

451
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
It was a deeply traumatic

452
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
Experience

453
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,680
Absolutely I can't imagine how much worse it would be if you are in your

454
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Church

455
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Mike Howard traumatized

456
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Having a shooting at a church

457
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Be traumatizing no matter what bad

458
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Level America's so f***** up we'll get to this level like granularly argue about what types of

459
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,488
Shootings are a problem three stages past like rational conversation Saturday

460
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,912
All right and that's another that that's what is important about what Alex is doing towards this Subway Shooters he does not give a s***

461
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
About the victims

462
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
Or about Solutions are about trying to avoid it

463
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
This is entirely in service of saying

464
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
This is happening so that's why it's okay for Dylan roof

465
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
Or why you shouldn't feel bad about dylann roof like

466
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
This is all in service of making it okay for white people to do at least

467
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Trying to make this

468
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Tire thing about Dylan

469
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
Body bags post before somebody shooting

470
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Where in the World War 3

471
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
Didn't even know really where he was or what he was doing

472
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Just like dylann roof

473
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
Didn't know he was gibbering the police

474
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
It was all white people smile

475
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
No

476
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Something wrong

477
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,080
Hogue grips

478
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
How does mad

479
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,504
I think obviously the conclusion that I came

480
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,112
Game 2 from the subway tragedy

481
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,744
Don't blame me for dylann roof

482
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,888
Call bouncing to this specific scenario

483
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,984
So the New York Post story that Alex's siding doesn't say that the shooter didn't know where he was

484
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,080
The witness just said quote I looked at him and I thought to myself he was talking

485
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,432
Tim self for like a while so I looked at him and I was like this guy must be on drugs

486
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
That's why

487
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Do you text the

488
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
What Alex's extrapolating outright

489
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
Also dylann roof didn't a bunch of gibberish during his killing spree

490
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
He showed up to a Bible study and was welcomed in by the churchgoers

491
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,352
They sat there with him for almost an hour before cutting down 9 people in Cold Blood while they pray

492
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,216
I know that Alex is trying to grasp at straws to make the story somehow about himself but this is some

493
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Shameful share

494
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
You can tell that he's mad I think I know why

495
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,408
And the aftermath of the Charleston shooting people didn't blame all white people in the same way

496
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,504
In the aftermath of the subway shooting people are blaming all black people

497
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
However Alex is a flagrant race

498
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:33,184
So he experienced the conversations after Charleston as an attack on white people and himself in

499
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
In particular

500
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,328
He only felt that way because that's how he experiences reality and then he went out looking

501
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
4 tweets and blog posts that would back up

502
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
His persecution

503
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,008
You know something straight weeks of someone blaming white people or something

504
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,824
In this current situation things are a little bit.

505
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Because Alex isn't

506
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
Experiencing the coverage of the shooting as an attack on himself in his own identity

507
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
He's not looking

508
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
For a defensive that narrative in the same way

509
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,624
As was the case with the Charleston shooting people aren't using the shooting took

510
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,464
Condemn an entire race to this becomes a situation where there's a media coverage

511
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
Hey what's the media allegedly covering up

512
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:14,656
Alex's narratives that this shooting wasn't text people and us we've come full circle

513
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,752
And every event of the news is understood only through the filter of How It's proof

514
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
How Alex is

515
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
Particular identity is

516
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Under attack

517
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Specifically

518
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,712
The obsession was talking about there's only through the prism of dylann roof that shooting

519
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
When is pretty towel

520
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
I think

521
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
I

522
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
I would say that

523
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
A Patel

524
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
I mean well

525
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
It does

526
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Seem like you can

527
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
Very quickly work

528
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Backwards

529
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
From that

530
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Go to

531
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
Let's save the human race

532
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
One by one

533
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
And ask them

534
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
Just pure what is your first

535
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
Word association game

536
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
Only Alex is going to come up with Dylan Rowe

537
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Sure you know what I kept

538
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Thinking about you and I was listening to this like

539
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,272
Alex is saying like in 2050 2015 whatever that

540
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
Some shooting happened everyone blamed all white people

541
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,184
I just keep thinking of the multiple times in these depositions

542
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
People like Alex and Owen Shroyer

543
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Have been asked

544
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Did you ever actually

545
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
What are your examples

546
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,656
Of calling for gun control after mass shooting

547
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
And they can't come up with enough

548
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,776
I would guarantee that Alex could not come up with anything other than a

549
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:29,408
The general feeling that he had the people were blaming all white people

550
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
Identity fears in victimhood and persecution obsession

551
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
That's what he's talkin to

552
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Yeah I mean ultimately

553
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
It could be seen today

554
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
To me that he's

555
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
Believes that white people are at fault for things

556
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
Have something coming to them and it is

557
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
Reacting so negatively because he wants

558
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
To try and avoid that outcome

559
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
You can

560
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Psychoanalyze email you want

561
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
I think you're pretty

562
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Goldwater rule

563
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
So I'll pull you back a little bit

564
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
So Alex

565
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
A lot

566
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Oh time

567
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,784
On this episode complaining about CNN Plus

568
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
Sure better later streaming service

569
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
People have subscribed

570
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,072
Alex brings a pet number a bunch

571
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
If you're going to dance on a streaming service I think CNN pluses is a good kwibi way2go

572
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:32,128
She's very much like

573
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,736
With that it's a little navel-gazing a little bit

574
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
He spends so much f****** time on this

575
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
We operate on

576
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,488
Michelle 60 million dollars worth of product on that

577
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
To be able to then get my Defender

578
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
To break even

579
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Take some of the money

580
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
We raised a year

581
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
To be able to sell that real estate

582
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Operation

583
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
So I'm down to my last

584
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Chips here

585
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
But but but not

586
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Because we're not

587
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Imagine that

588
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
We're operating on

589
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,352
You're operating on 27 million dollars a year

590
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
On crew only go with all the attacks

591
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Plus

592
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Watch with 400 million dollars

593
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Less than 10,000 viewers

594
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
A week

595
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
You can start a cooking show yourself on YouTube Annabelle

596
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Decent

597
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Within a week or left

598
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Well that's not

599
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Dead cat

600
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
To get more View

601
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
Webcam on it

602
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
1

603
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Joe Rogan

604
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
About it

605
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Okay look

606
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
This is important stuff

607
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Obviously covering

608
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
CNN plus not being very popular

609
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
I don't know

610
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
Who is watching live streams of dead cats I mean at least 10 to 12 thousand

611
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
People are eyasu

612
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
I think you might have asked you.

613
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Version of

614
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
How difficult it is to crack into the attention

615
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,008
Do you have a cooking show a halfway decent

616
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
A within a week

617
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
Tens of thousands

618
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,200
The people will find you

619
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
He doesn't realize

620
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,320
How ignorable he would be if he wasn't this deep in his career

621
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
If he hadn't

622
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,928
Started prior to YouTube and started like

623
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Wayback

624
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,304
He wasn't grandfathered-in no one to give a s*** about his dumb show

625
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
It's such a stupid

626
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Stupid

627
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Source of information and honestly

628
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
I think in the absence of Alex

629
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
Someone else might be as good of a showman as him

630
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Absolutely Maybe

631
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Absolutely

632
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:16,736
I don't know I'm not sure how attractive is program could be if it wasn't

633
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Imagine

634
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
Disappearing out of nowhere

635
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
No one gives a s***

636
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
There's crazier stuff there's more interest

637
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Sing stuff

638
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
I mean I think it's a little bit like a little bit like a comedy the pre-internet you know of like

639
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,936
There are so many Gatekeepers before the internet that

640
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,008
There is no way to break in unless you started unless you knew

641
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
And that kind

642
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,336
Kind of kept things much more homogenized in it

643
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
People from experimenting a lot of really interesting

644
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
All the sudden the internet comes along and

645
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
You could be a mediocre white dude comic

646
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,928
And have a very good career and then the internet hitting it's like

647
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Oh there's a lot of mediocre White

648
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,304
Do Thomas around maybe there's maybe I should work

649
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
Hard but at the same time

650
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Everybody

651
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Can put out a time to stop

652
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,288
Your is even you know it's probably as hard or harder

653
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
With the

654
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
The amount of stuff that people

655
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
Can put out or get any kind of traction or 10

656
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Absolutely

657
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,760
That's good, cuz you are there's a hundred thousand of you

658
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
888 just as good if not better

659
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
And even if you're doing something wildly creative guess what there's a lot other people are doing Wiley

660
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
Put just come down to like well people didn't see you at the right time

661
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
You know like

662
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
My point is that Alex

663
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Sucks

664
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,984
N80 is no value if it wasn't

665
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,824
But

666
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Elon Musk

667
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Nope

668
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
Disagree

669
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,992
Elon Musk battling back about the inside baseball on that

670
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
A while back

671
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Play frightened Austin

672
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
I run with people

673
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Weekly basis

674
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
And I support.

675
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
What I was told was going to happen

676
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Elon Musk

677
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
He's going to buy Twitter is battling the New World Order

678
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
Doesn't get more tip of the spear than pretending to buy Twitter and possibly getting a dress

679
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:37,536
Westgate times that we all know he commits that they just doesn't get punished for because

680
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
Consequences are anathema to the wealthy

681
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,656
Quite a battle

682
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
Alex

683
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Incredible

684
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
You've taken very seriously by what

685
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
He would describe his intellectual circles where

686
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Work is never done

687
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm always Scrabble to get money just to stay on the air

688
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
Authoritative and more

689
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Influential

690
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
In-N-Out

691
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
Natural circles around the world

692
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
Your investment Infowars

693
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Is

694
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Always

695
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
Turn off better day by day

696
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
How to get the babies

697
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
It's about to be

698
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
We all the works coming in now

699
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
I have almost spent

700
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Pastor Reserve money I have

701
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600

$4000000

703
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Months ago

704
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Okay

705
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,704
Everybody we've got working here and I'm not bitching or complaining

706
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,288
Why should we have layoffs

707
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,128
Lawsuits coming to trials this summer

708
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
I mean we're under mass of a tax levy

709
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
The battle

710
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
But you decide so much so now

711
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Romans Ashman

712
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
I need everybody's seriously to get off

713
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Offend

Dot-com

715
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,592
That is about the most

716
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Concretely I've heard him

717
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Express

I need you to pay my legal fees

719
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,296
That is about as blunt as it's been

720
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
They like

721
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,368
Look I'm going to get hit with some really big

722
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,744
Vines coming up soon I need your help

Yep

726
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
The plan

727
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,968
Whatever he gets fine that's how many ice cream

728
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,112
I might have to divide

729
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
Zohir Alex gets back

730
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Back to

731
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Some

732
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Conversations about the New York subway shooting

733
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
He really really gets

734
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Pretty f*****-up

735
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Open racist here

736
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Charleston

737
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
2000

738
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Church

739
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
People he never met and didn't know. Nothing to it

740
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Shot more than

741
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Killing knife

742
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
Matter they said all white people were to blame

743
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
No I'm not to blame

744
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
People are not to blame

745
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Is the one

746
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,568
Just like the New York subway shooter Frank James

747
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
Is a black nationalist

748
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Waukesha parade killer

749
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
Recently released video Manifesto

750
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Video

751
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Court Justice doesn't like her

752
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
Because she's married

753
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
2A

754
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Gibbering

755
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Who do we blame me blame the

756
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,224
Blame them covering up the fact that black on white crime is at least

757
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Sometimes

758
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
White on black crime

759
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,112
Because the media promotes that white people are bad and deserve to be mugged

760
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
And many black leaders even where I live in Texas

761
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,744
Robin your neighborhood go rob white people

762
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
You don't Robert kill anybody

763
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
How about that

764
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,960
Seems like that chick clip took an intensely racist turn at the end

765
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:07,360
The feeling that Alex is doing everything in his power to stop until from black people

766
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
Here's what I would say

767
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
I would say

768
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
That's

769
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
All black people

770
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,576
I have standing to sue Alec

771
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
Books for defamation there because we know that that is not

772
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,304
There is no such thing as black people committing 10 times more crimes than white people that's not a thing

773
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
Discuss this year

774
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
15 people

775
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
He killed nine and injured wanted

776
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
National person

777
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
Bigger issues oh Alex has these crime

778
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
Statistics entirely wrong like your

779
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,152
Literally just repeating inaccurate races proper

780
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Again.

781
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,320
This conclusion the black-on-white crime is 10 times higher than a black crime is reachable when you don't factor in Papi

782
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,880
Relation ratios and other factors at urinalysis

783
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,440
And this is a standard drink at white nationalist and white

784
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Supremacist groups

785
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Reviews for decades

786
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
Have black people as dangerous

787
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
We've talked about this race is myth a bit

788
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
The past and hoteling it is that Alex thinks

789
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,984
I'm not going to dive into that fully again

790
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
But this actually leads me to an import

791
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Point

792
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,944
I was just trying to use some kind of Illusion that all white people are blamed for the Charleston shooting in order to frame his coverage of the New York

793
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
Instead of blaming all black people Alex has decided he's going to do is blame the media for covering up that black on white crime

794
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Is 10 times higher than white on black crime

795
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
In order to make black people feel like

796
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
Like they should attack the media to be

797
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Apparently doing

798
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,960
This is literally what dylann roof wrote in his Manifesto about why you decided

799
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
To carry out the Charleston shooting

800
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,360
This is from his Manifesto that was published on his website the last Rhodesian

801
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Quote

802
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
B of A truly waking me with the Trayvon Martin

803
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
McKay's

804
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
I kept hearing and seeing his name and eventually I decided

805
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
It look him up

806
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:56,416
I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was

807
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,488
It was obviously a Zimmerman was in the right

808
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,120
More importantly this prompted me to type in the words black on white crime into Google and I have never been

809
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
The same sense that day

810
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
The first website I came to the Council of conservative citizens

811
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,312
There were Pages upon pages of these brutal black-on-white murders

812
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
I was in disbelief

813
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
At this moment I realized something was very wrong

814
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
How could the news be blowing up his Trayvon Martin case well

815
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Hundreds

816
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,552
Black-on-white murders got ignored

817
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,720
I was just using the image of Dylan roofs not justify his racist response to the New York subway shooting but the truth is italics

818
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Is dylann roof

819
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:38,400
Alex's disseminating the exact same people

820
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Praying in a church

821
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Specifically because they were black

822
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,032
Alex is spreading the same information to his audience

823
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,104
Potentially sending other impressionable listeners.

824
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,944
That may not lead to murder but definitely leads over racism

825
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
Difficult to believe that he doesn't know what he's doing

826
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,832
Beers had plenty of time to figure out that this is a

827
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,208
Incorrect racist meth and he heard doesn't care or he knows that it is and he still perpetuates it

828
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
The f*** him

829
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Yeah

830
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
That's

831
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
That's great

832
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
I mean

833
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Wow

834
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,728
In response to this mass shooting

835
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
10 quiz racially-motivated

836
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
Movie quote dylann roof

837
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,432
Paraphrases Manifesto

838
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,016
0 times when it's a good idea to paraphrase

839
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
Manifest

840
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,976
I mean you see where we did that episode on Anders Breivik how similar a lot of Alex's Rider Rick is to the things that were in

841
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,096
Aspiring to him

842
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,448
Inspired by the great replacement conspiracy theories

843
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,288
Oh that's early made of appearance in a number

844
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
And Alex's coverages identical

845
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,872
Because the reality of this

846
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
I mean it's the point

847
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,247
You can't say stochastic terrorism enough

848
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Whenever

849
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
The point

850
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
He's too

851
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Create an environment

852
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Aurorae

853
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Reality

854
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
Wherein it is justifiable

855
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
To commit those Acts

856
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Exit Massachusetts

857
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
So regardless of whether or not Alex

858
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Quote unquote

859
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
What's them to happen

860
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
By disseminating this b*******

861
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,871
You are trying to make them happen increasing the likelihood that people will find places that I've even more

862
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
Extreme versions of these racist

863
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Poison live

864
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Yep

865
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
Online if they if they search these things out and they'll become

866
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,367
Deeper radicalized

867
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
If it's not a path

868
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
Did someone responsible would go down

869
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
To put it simply

870
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
His response

871
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
To a mass shooter

872
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
Of which there are

873
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Just egg

874
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
Unconscionable number

875
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Is to say things

876
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,983
Things that will inspire another mass shooting

877
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Or at least definitely have

878
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Really this is

879
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,455
Maybe it beside the point maybe a trivial issue

880
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:05,343
This is the kind of thing that would get somebody fired at a regular job

881
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
3 like

882
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,439
Repeated insistence of these

883
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
That would get you

884
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
F****** fired so far

885
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
100%

886
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
And

887
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
He doesn't have to worry about that

888
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
No boss

889
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,471
Snopes anyway Alex's got some information wrong about the

890
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,751
Frank James situation

891
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Kill all white Easter

892
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Troubleshooting

893
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,895
Black Nationals rhetoric

894
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
Praise beautiful 911

895
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
Turn settings on FBI Terror list

896
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,647
Ages of tribe investigating but the investigation

897
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Was

898
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Killed

899
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
There was no investigation that was killed Alex is making that up

900
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
There were some inaccurate reports

901
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
That Frank James

902
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,191
Formerly on the FBI watchlist but it turns out it was a different person named Frank James

903
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,287
This is a mistake someone could make but what Alex is doing isn't the same thing

904
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,383
He's taking this inaccurate reporting then building a conspiracy on top of it

905
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
Not only was he formerly on this watch list but someone in the FBI killed an investigation into a now why would they

906
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
They do that

907
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
Why would they

908
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
They do that

909
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
Nothing else says

910
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Means anything

911
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:17,023
Guy takes mistake sword or things he makes up and then makes up stuff on top of them it's

912
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Soulja Boy

913
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Yep you can

914
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,143
You can make a mistake if you're like oh I found on this

915
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,215
Former

916
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
Could this be the same person

917
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
Everybody could bet you know

918
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
Billion Frank James is out there

919
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
But

920
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,015
Then add like

921
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
And

922
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Because I saw this

923
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
Possible name that matches on this thing

924
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,791
Clearly the president assassinated his Dad tried to investigate him and then the investor

925
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Navigation was killed

926
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Holden

927
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
Harley from Alex's imagination

928
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Total b*******

929
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,775
Writing elaborate

930
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,871
Maxi's about is the case of the witmer kidnappers

931
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Right

932
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
But she the wheels are coming off

933
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
The witmer fraud

934
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,039
Millions and millions spent

935
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Michigan

936
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Define

937
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Langley

938
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Young white man

939
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Fatherless homes

940
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Who were looking for

941
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
Male role models

942
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
And who were upset about the decline of America

943
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Firearms

944
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,935
To be basically in the military without joining

945
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
They come up

946
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
Activate an order them that be

947
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Themselves

948
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Wittmershaus

949
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
No no I don't want you

950
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
BFDI

951
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
Muscle them and command them

952
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Police show up

953
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
And run around at night the bushes bar

954
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
She was a victim

955
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
When people during lockdown

956
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
What is a fun scene from a movie or something but that this isn't accurate

957
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:14,783
Yeah the four defendants in the case were acquitted and the jury was unable to reach a verdict for the other two

958
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
Is there an audio even close to what Alex is describing this never would have even gone

959
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
The trial

960
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,695
Also Alex is conveniently ignoring the fact

961
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
The two conspirators

962
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:29,375
Play the guilty already sure and there are eight other people facing State charges that are set to go to court

963
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Although

964
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
There are problems

965
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,543
You generally speaking is at the FBI rushed

966
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
They jump too early for the arrest as the pot and it was going on was

967
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
Solid enough for them to likely get charges

968
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Is the stick

969
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,831
As it stands now it's too easy for the defense attorneys to portray what was going on is just some dudes talking

970
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
S***

971
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
Doesn't help that there were multiple bowls

972
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,207
On the group since that doesn't lend itself to the impression

973
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
And the FBI

974
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Was running the whole thing

975
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
But that's not borne out by the end

976
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Information

977
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
That is available

978
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
But it's just fun this dislike

979
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,471
It's in the evidence that you cut her head off

980
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
CFB izone

981
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
If they hadn't if they hadn't built a reputation for doing

982
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,271
That adjacent behavior in the past whether or not it's an all-the-time thing or anything like that but

983
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,855
You do it one time it's there I don't I don't have like

984
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,671
Necessarily a problem with some

985
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
Around anus

986
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
And I also don't think there's like

987
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Absence of criticism

988
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
That that is Meredith

989
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
But totally

990
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,959
I don't think that the claims that Alex is making

991
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
AR

992
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Our defense

993
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,871
Play that audio

994
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
The Watergate tapes

995
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:55,903
Go run around in the bushes

996
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
You ever see your Hot Shots part Deux

997
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,303
Look up people

998
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
Stop be asleep and Alex's decided

999
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,911
He's going to have a little weight so

1000
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Alex's

1001
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
Very conveniently forgetting all of his buddies

1002
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
Have been

1003
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:17,407
In the background

1004
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
That Stuart Road

1005
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Works for the FBI

1006
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Interesting syllogism

1007
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
I don't know

1008
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,135
Find me maybe that's Google

1009
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:32,767
A parley with the FBI

1010
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Shut up right now

1011
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Okay

1012
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
If you're a student at sea

1013
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
Hey FBI

1014
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
How about we turn these tables around yeah

1015
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,543
More like

1016
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
Yes sir I don't know anything

1017
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,431
Okay you say to the FBI

1018
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Alright

1019
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
I've heard the tale

1020
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,575
Investigated you are they going to be like

1021
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
What nobody's ever done this before doing a runaway oh my God you're so manly this is terrifying

1022
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,839
You're clearly not scared of me

1023
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Nonsense

1024
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:46,239
So Alex is opening is like they want to violets going into the midterm

1025
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Democrats

1026
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
The globalist are just a Kratts now

1027
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,687
So they want violence going into the midterms that's the only way they're going to win this shooting

1028
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Subway

1029
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
Staged

1030
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,319
Maybe it's okay

1031
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,255
There's a headline Democrat death march to November town hall and it just says every poll shows

1032
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Landslide US history

1033
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
He won the second time

1034
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
False Flags

1035
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
I pointed out you will see mass shootings and subways

1036
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Anna churches

1037
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Colleges

1038
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Shopping malls

1039
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Everyday

1040
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
For the last few months

1041
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,879
Schizophrenic

1042
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
And then turn the cameras off

1043
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
In New York

1044
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
The higher-ups didn't let him

1045
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Shopping

1046
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,223
So it wasn't I didn't know about it and they did have control which isn't true

1047
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
Okay but they

1048
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
Hey buddy could have

1049
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,599
True if it is

1050
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
80s

1051
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:16,095
Who knows that is worthwhile

1052
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,959
Death march to November is

1053
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
I don't care

1054
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
Analysis of Aldi

1055
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Please Depot

1056
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
No

1057
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
It's a guy who worked for Breitbart

1058
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,295
It does seem like he would be let's say unbiased

1059
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Yeah

1060
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
I think this is

1061
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
This is just dumb

1062
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
You know it's crazy to me

1063
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
Vicious

1064
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
A prime Street

1065
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Diedrich opportunity

1066
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Do the

1067
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
Bare minimum of

1068
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Zoom saying you're not race

1069
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
You know you could if he was just like

1070
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,775
This is exactly like dylann roof

1071
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,103
Play I mean just like that if he just equivocating them

1072
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
Entirely

1073
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,711
This being about black people

1074
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
It would be one

1075
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:10,367
He's so racist

1076
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
Secondarily I don't

1077
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
That they're the same

1078
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
They're absolutely not

1079
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,095
It would maybe be racist to say that they're the same

1080
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
Absolutely would be racist to say the same

1081
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:27,263
But in Alex's world that would be that would be like

1082
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,895
It's not about what you're describing is what he's trying to do or what he

1083
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,199
Thinks he's doing you know what you might be right

1084
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,551
Oh my God you might be right this is the worst day of my life I'm sorry

1085
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,111
Well I'd like to make your day better by having

1086
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Alex tell you about a study you could even read

1087
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
But I want to get to this

1088
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
New York

1089
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
California

1090
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,935
What's the number to

1091
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,007
The lowest death rate for the comp

1092
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Backcountry

1093
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,175
The study it's abundantly clear that he hasn't read the article under this headline they have no idea what the

1094
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
The study is

1095
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,599
New York Post at Reid's New York California failed at handling covid but Florida was among best

1096
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Study

1097
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:19,487
Why do you read the headline like that if it's probably good idea to ask yourself two questions

1098
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
The first is

1099
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,631
How does the study define success in dealing with covid-19 second who did this study

1100
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Well the thing about

1101
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
It was and you would

1102
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
I've seen this coming but

1103
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,567
The measurement was how successful you were at getting around

1104
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Covid risk

1105
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
So Florida was the best

1106
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,199
Dad put a little jumping hurdles

1107
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,759
Just a little bit below your nose you know what I'm saying

1108
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,807
That would be an interesting study it's not

1109
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,135
I think in this case answering the second

1110
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,159
In question who did

1111
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,975
The study and helps you get halfway to answering the first Quest

1112
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,815
This was a study done by the committee to unleash prosperity

1113
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
Which is a nonprofit group dedicated

1114
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,679
It's pushing policies that will ramp up economic growth

1115
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
If you are non supervillain

1116
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:07,615
You know there's only there's really just one simple rule don't put unleash in your name

1117
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
If you're a super villain

1118
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
That's where you put it

1119
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
Unsurprisingly the committee

1120
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:17,087
He's co-founders Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore Economist with deep connections

1121
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
To the network

1122
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
And our board members are very swings

1123
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,975
Within the American legislative exam

1124
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
Exchange Council

1125
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Is their way of putting

1126
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,399
Policies around legislators

1127
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,799
Expect this is a study that is not primarily about mortality from covid it's an economic

1128
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,335
Institution with strong right-wing

1129
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,711
Putting out a paper meant to justify the argument the places except business is open our bet

1130
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:49,599
Better sure to be clear I think that New York and California and our beloved Illinois

1131
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
They can come their way about handling covid issues

1132
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,719
But I'm not going to take a study from the committee to Unleashed

1133
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,023
Prosperity very seriously in terms of that argument

1134
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Read the article or the

1135
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Tostada

1136
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
I am

1137
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Going to dismiss it out of

1138
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
I am too

1139
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727
Moving along

1140
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
I think that

1141
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Make your move that much

1142
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
Well I mean I do like

1143
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
The idea of

1144
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
More things have a baby named Unleashed

1145
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,015
Get like more charitable like this is the national Center for unleashing vac

1146
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
Maxine's on you tell the committee to unleash the kraken

1147
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Exactly

1148
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
Our sources God is truth our source is

1149
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
Sacrifice price

1150
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
They receive it

1151
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,855
We are ancestors and our current

1152
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
Brethren and those in the future

1153
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Eternity

1154
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
Because eternity is not enough

1155
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Wait what

1156
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
What is greater than eternity

1157
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Unlimited

1158
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
What

1159
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
God

1160
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
What

1161
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:22,015
I want to take your calls from Chris Michael Alex Rush Brandon

1162
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,391
Nobody Does it Better If I got the Ethereal with the pedestrian

1163
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,511
I'm talking about incident in Trinity is within God's and then immediately

1164
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
Imma take a dump call

1165
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:40,191
The eternities Beyond eternity SV eternities of eternities yes I would like the

1166
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Nice please

1167
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Thank you very much

1168
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,871
Yep help meeting with rambling about esoteric Christian ideas

1169
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:52,479
The closest we get in the present-day to good old singing along with country music I think

1170
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
Yeah

1171
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Periodic times he sings along

1172
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Country music

1173
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
So much more rare

1174
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:07,071
So Alex gives himself a little bit of a status report checking in boss but sometimes you got to Be Your Own Boss

1175
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
What's the scraper

1176
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
Mentally ill schizophrenic

1177
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Black Sopranos

1178
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,335
The winning that reportedly shot all these p

1179
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
Situation

1180
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
And it flies in the face of the

1181
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
FBI

1182
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
The last two years

1183
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
People

1184
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
Dylan roof

1185
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
Other cases with the media is not going to

1186
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
They didn't do that

1187
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
After Charleston shooting

1188
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Are you saying they

1189
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
Should be doing that now I believe so the ideas being expressed a really weird and kind of all over the place

1190
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Woodfield

1191
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
Intensely racist

1192
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
Yeah I mean

1193
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,599
It's hard not to think that you really want

1194
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
What he saying to be true

1195
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
Which I think is weird

1196
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
Headspace

1197
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,999
The feeling that comes

1198
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,023
Lacrosse

1199
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,607
I wish that people had said it was all white people's fault

1200
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
Feel like they did

1201
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
But I mean like

1202
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
I think I think

1203
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
Here's what I would say yeah

1204
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
As opposed to wish

1205
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
I ain't think he's can

1206
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
Confused

1207
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,991
The people aren't blaming all black people for this

1208
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,831
The Gap and how he's dealing with this ridiculous.

1209
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Because he

1210
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,439
Feels and thinks that they did blame all white people after dylann roof

1211
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Confuse that no one's being racist

1212
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Just enough for something

1213
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,607
I need everybody be racist right now

1214
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
I think that's

1215
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
Part of the Constitution

1216
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,191
Alex

1217
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
I need a little bit more

1218
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
Brian stelter

1219
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
Humpty Dumpty

1220
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,455
This goes on

1221
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,479
Too long

1222
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,527
No one can put

1223
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
CNN MSNBC

1224
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
In the corner

1225
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,135
And the whole corporate media

1226
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Together again

1227
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,487
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dump

1228
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,215
Humpty Dumpty the greatest examples

1229
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,775
Humpty Dumpty said we must ensure the mall

1230
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,591
Speak

1231
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,383
Humpty Dumpty

1232
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Ugly and disgusting feet

1233
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,783
What is a wall Humpty Dumpty

1234
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
All the king's horses

1235
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Couldn't

1236
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
Humpty Dumpty back together again

1237
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
What can I do

1238
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
But look here's the thing

1239
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
That like

1240
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,423
Started the parody started okay

1241
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,983
Yeah

1242
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,311
Thought you was f****** me

1243
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:03,711
She's going to roll roll my brain is just going to take me through to the break with this amazing ride and I'm coming

1244
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,063
Lee falls apart with these are the only ones who can speak being rhymes with had ugly feet

1245
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,879
Yep I'm seeing Brian stelter's fetalis

1246
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:15,743
Maybe just going to those websites are creepy websites

1247
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
I don't know I'm not going to look it up

1248
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,607
But I think

1249
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
By the end

1250
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
He's just

1251
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
Reciting helped

1252
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
I got much like

1253
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
Icarus

1254
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,735
And I got to go back to Safe Harbor that was too long

1255
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Commit to

1256
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:43,391
The parody or shut it down just by calling him Humpty Dumpty that's fine

1257
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
Right

1258
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Tall man

1259
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
It is

1260
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
This is probably the most

1261
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
The closest that Alex and I can

1262
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Canfield

1263
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,679
Because both of us have absolutely

1264
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
Experience this moment where the Improv Garden is

1265
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,567
Empty stage

1266
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,687
Does me to Mann Eye Care

1267
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
Performing at the last Factory

1268
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:14,623
I have like 40 someone like me does not belong on a stage like that where there's a two-drink minimum

1269
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,023
It's just all dark a Sea of Faces so many times was just me at like

1270
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,351
Some idea or some thought I have is like

1271
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
And if silence

1272
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Here we go

1273
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
I can relate to that feeling a lot

1274
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
Oh yeah

1275
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
It's not good but

1276
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,407
I will say that I didn't then Retreat to just reciting Humpty Dump

1277
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:42,783
No I'm proud of that job is to overcome

1278
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
You know we always turn him into

1279
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
It the Clown's almost more

1280
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
Lovable

1281
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
Never going to not be a

1282
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Israel

1283
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,775
Please don't turn back

1284
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Because that's real

1285
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Why would

1286
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
Time Warner

1287
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,015
Put that on TV

1288
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
Cuz they want to force ugliness

1289
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
Evil

1290
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,135
July

1291
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
On you cuz there hunchback

1292
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
And they're ugly spiritual

1293
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
And they like the fact

1294
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,815
Ugliness songs

1295
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
They're spiritual

1296
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
They're filthy

1297
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,895
I got to assume there's some kind of internal metrics

1298
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
And Alex knows that like 18

1299
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,759
Complains about stelter for long periods of time it does numbers

1300
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
You think something

1301
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:54,207
I don't know the man just hates Brian stelter

1302
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,583
I think that could I mean that's obviously a part of it I just don't know

1303
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
He's never given me

1304
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,655
Anywhere near enough

1305
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,983
Stelter's crimes to justify

1306
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
This level of despair of hate

1307
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,591
I think I saw somebody what is a poster like

1308
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Text Altura.

1309
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Quarterly

1310
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
DNR

1311
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:20,063
It also has been since the beginning of this that he's been yelling about

1312
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
How many years is a Jedi

1313
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
He hasn't even done anything

1314
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:28,511
You just I would I would I would argue that I wouldn't know his name

1315
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,791
If it weren't for

1316
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:34,655
100% I would maybe be able to recognize him as somebody who's on CNN

1317
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
But I would not know his name

1318
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
Never

1319
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,287
More people to Brad self

1320
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
And assumably Ithaca

1321
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
Comments about guns

1322
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Aftermath

1323
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,039
Of the

1324
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,599
Deepest Subway shooting Friday

1325
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Wants to like

1326
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
Really clown on it

1327
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Because

1328
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
For some reason

1329
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Biden started talking about

1330
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
Prostitutes

1331
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
In the middle of this talk

1332
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,375
Talking about gun he's crazy he doesn't know where he is man okay

1333
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Here's that clip

1334
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Here's Biden

1335
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Can't even get it right

1336
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,615
Butchers it and brings in

1337
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
Prostitutes

1338
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,271
I said what do you think the deer your hundred wear Kevlar vest what tell you need

1339
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
20 bullets for

1340
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,599
You must be a hell of a terrible shot

1341
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,159
Think about it

1342
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
Think about the mass shootings

1343
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,279
Bonnie's 100 rounds

1344
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
The weapon of War

1345
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,423
There's nothing to do

1346
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Is Recreation

1347
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,799
Alright Banning the sale and possession of

1348
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Unserialized guns

1349
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:54,527
Eliminate gun manufacturers immunity from liability the only outfit so the only outfit

1350
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,231
The Prostitute being sued

1351
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
Come on

1352
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
Zoe just misspoke

1353
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Execution

1354
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Inside of

1355
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
Wow

1356
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
This is this

1357
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,751
This is big as that Nancy Pelosi clip

1358
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,311
She misspoke 1 times

1359
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
The tip of the spear

1360
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,639
This is big

1361
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
Having this clip

1362
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Now

1363
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,271
Metaphorical Smoking Gun

1364
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
That proves Jim Carrey

1365
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,647
Is Joe B I would say so I don't think there's any other

1366
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
Conclusion

1367
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,487
Take take a viking comments

1368
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,047
However you will agree or disagree with him

1369
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
I don't think anybody who is acting

1370
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
From the position of sincerity could say like

1371
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,519
That wasn't just him misspeaking say prosecute

1372
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:53,151
Pretty f****** clear. Trying to make a bigger deal out of it

1373
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,175
Seems desperate

1374
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,199
Yeah

1375
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,527
With Trump

1376
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
Stuff

1377
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
I think sometimes

1378
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,879
His be speaking might have been a little more funny

1379
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:08,255
And I honestly think that if Alex was covering this like recognizing that he just misspoke

1380
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
And thought it was

1381
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
Funny that that's the word that he said

1382
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,959
I don't think that would be anything even worth comment on

1383
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Conception

1384
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
Chewy

1385
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
Fires bringing prostitution

1386
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
No that's just

1387
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,151
We just had the wrong word

1388
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
Yeah I'm at your best

1389
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,271
Did the best you could do even then is like

1390
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Piano

1391
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,879
He's not out of it he's not scrambled

1392
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:39,487
But it's like he's not as quick as it used to be

1393
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,535
Maybe we shouldn't have 85 year old president

1394
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:46,143
That's a conversation more sense

1395
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
Anyway

1396
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:54,591
And it's called from a guy

1397
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,687
In New Jersey Adam thank you for calling her on here

1398
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
Alec sauce

1399
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:07,391
Just want to let you know you are the tip of the spear thank you for everything that you do I want take up a little bit

1400
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,415
Your time Anna

1401
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
I live in Jersey

1402
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
Going on in Brooklyn

1403
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,583
It just seems all too conveniently seen this move by the globalist

1404
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
They overplay their hand and then they go

1405
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Play to the other side

1406
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,263
It just it just enough over here that's wanted to get there

1407
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,871
Conveniently the camera failed

1408
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
Play Shadow the thousands of cameras that's the one area where they failed

1409
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
That's exactly what I'm saying

1410
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:39,135
Too coincidental

1411
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,999
Yeah that's that's why I'm awake

1412
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,327
Misconception about the actual story is relating to

1413
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,863
To the cameras in the subway not work

1414
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:55,775
According to officials who spoke to the New York Times the issue was a faulty fiber optic cable that affected the stage

1415
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,823
Mission as well as to others nearby

1416
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:02,431
However this was not the case for all of the cameras in the stations

1417
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
Tim Menton the spokesperson for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said quote

1418
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,903
The suspect was able to be seen in movements evaluated with the mta's assist

1419
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,487
He added that the cameras with malfunction

1420
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
Thing for youth we're located at Turnstyle

1421
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,095
Where they would not be in a position

1422
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
To capture any activity on the platform

1423
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Below

1424
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,239
It wasn't even affecting Ray needed to be

1425
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
Right

1426
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:32,383
They were still able to get izone prank

1427
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
I'm so like the issue is

1428
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Kind of

1429
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
Maybe

1430
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
Coincidental

1431
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,391
Slightly interesting on some level but it doesn't really affect

1432
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
The reality of

1433
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
What would

1434
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:52,351
So what's important is just that the next caller is

1435
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:58,495
Golf Wang how big this is weird why are you out yet it's a false flag

1436
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
A more skeptical mind might come to this sort of different possibility which is that maybe a ton of the cameras in the

1437
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
New York Subway system don't work

1438
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,271
And they're just there for show and saying that the ones in the station happened to be off

1439
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
Is to cover your ass a little bit

1440
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:18,207
I don't know if there's any evidence pointing in that direction but it seems like a more reasonable suspicion to have than what this

1441
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Is collars getting at

1442
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:24,607
I know that I worked at more than one low-paying job where they had cameras that definitely didn't work

1443
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
At least in one case it only

1444
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:30,239
Came out that the cameras weren't plugged in after someone needed footage to prove something

1445
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
It's not unheard of the companies do that

1446
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,151
I think it's a stretch to assume that an entity as large as the MTA would do it

1447
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,711
I will

1448
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,575
Let me know I'm not saying it's impossible to take it to scratch

1449
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
But put Stillwater underestimate the underfunding of public transportation I think that's still a farm

1450
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Reasonable

1451
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
Spiracy questioning

1452
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:58,911
I guess angle to have on it then whatever they're talking about

1453
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
This is like

1454
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
Premeditation

1455
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,519
They turned off the cameras gear

1456
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Yeah here's your

1457
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,615
Conspiracy

1458
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
The government has

1459
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,943
Has been over to

1460
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
Taken by the wealthy and is transformed

1461
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,551
Itself into what amounts to a kleptocracy

1462
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,623
That steals money that would be going towards

1463
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
Say public-funded issues like transfer

1464
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,511
Predation in the lakes and whenever you find out that needed

1465
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
To be there

1466
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:30,655
That's when you discover that essentially they're running on a goddamn skeleton what's been ripped away from

1467
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,471
I feel like that happens when a bridge collapses

1468
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,823
Anyway the same caller has some other dumb ideas and so does Alex

1469
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,895
Damn all these videos of his social media

1470
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
He was some Mastermind why did he have all these videos

1471
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
Basically saying he's crazy out

1472
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,087
And I would suddenly this guy it doesn't make sense

1473
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,695
Wallpaper

1474
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Blocked it

1475
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,775
I will continue to watch it as it develops

1476
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,847
Necessarily accusing James being amassed

1477
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
This was not the most

1478
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
Intricately planned attack

1479
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
Has ever been

1480
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Pretty blonde

1481
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Force

1482
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
More importantly though it's really critical to look what Alex

1483
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
The saying hear about race

1484
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,231
Alex's conjecture is that if Frank James have been

1485
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
Killed that invest

1486
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,047
Navigation to him and that they

1487
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
Only did that because he's black so it doesn't fit the narrative

1488
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,631
That they want to push

1489
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,191
What's going on here is it Alex's taking

1490
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,031
The fake piece of information that James was actually on this FBI watchlist

1491
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
And using that to make the story fit

1492
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Hughes narrative

1493
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:50,271
Alex is the one who's forcing things into a predetermined narratives and accepting bad information because it adheres to the conclusion

1494
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
But he already wants to be true

1495
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,879
Which is somehow that this would have been different

1496
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,159
If he was white

1497
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
I am at

1498
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,463
Because Alex is right

1499
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Places

1500
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,767
Purely in service

1501
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,095
I'm saying that the entire United States

1502
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
Prejudiced

1503
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,031
So we get to a little comment about Russia and Putin

1504
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
In the war

1505
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:19,455
Haha and how honest Fitness I was one of those Donna's people there's ever been since no proof

1506
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
These are real good point how can you prove it

1507
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
You considered that

1508
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
Alex's

1509
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Currently

1510
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
Put music

1511
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
I said put one into a trap

1512
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
Right away

1513
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,103
Globalization

1514
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,711
But doesn't mean I'm an old Jabo you're so smart to go in there

1515
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,319
Don't give me that

1516
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,367
What do you think was waiting for him

1517
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
What do you think

1518
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,767
All the special forces units of Europe

1519
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,839
And the and the Delta Force the rest of them for

1520
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
We like jaguar

1521
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,079
You better if you know that why did you say that they were going to just all not have any opposition in the oven

1522
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:24,479
Because Russia had paid off everybody and their Reno fighting and they'd be over in 48 hours if you knew

1523
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,295
Special Forces have been training for a decade or whatever

1524
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,319
It's all nonsense

1525
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,159
But I like the idea that going to be an old-fashioned

1526
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
I mean

1527
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
Wow what is

1528
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
What is this

1529
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
Crazy

1530
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
Mixed-up world

1531
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Does wild

1532
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,655
Clarification that we need to make here

1533
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
When the war was just starting

1534
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,495
Alex did say that

1535
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:51,359
Into a trap but it wasn't about losing the war the Ukrainian forces were

1536
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,199
Still saying that Ukrainian military have been bought off and all that

1537
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
When Alex said that Putin had walked into a trap

1538
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
He was saying goodbye invading Putin made himself vulnerable to being blamed for a cyber-attack false flag that Alex was sure

1539
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
The closest swab was going to pull presumably on the way

1540
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,327
I was very specific about this and now he's trying to rewrite s*** about like what the

1541
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:16,703
Trap was

1542
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,519
Specifics of words because when he says trap

1543
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:26,175
He's talking about something in his head that you can bring into the conversation with something in your head

1544
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,223
Agree that they're both traps

1545
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,039
And assume that Alex is talking about something correct

1546
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
Instead of being like

1547
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
Here's the problem

1548
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,135
Okay Putin is walking into a trap

1549
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
What is happens olinsky is setup

1550
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,487
This box okay and underneath that he's got a

1551
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,535
Plate with a cheese sandwich on it

1552
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
And it's held up by a

1553
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
Small stick

1554
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,143
Now he doesn't even know

1555
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,423
You can't see that

1556
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
Olisis the cheese sandwich

1557
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,895
Really thought you were going to involve like a marble at a shoot

1558
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,431
Mousetrap

1559
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,247
Alright

1560
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
Spine

1561
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:08,671
I'm going to have to soothe my wounds disappointment with another caller

1562
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:14,047
Brutal this person

1563
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
Took their dad to the VA

1564
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,911
Because they're worried about

1565
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
Vaccine injury

1566
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,519
And they think that the

1567
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
The dad got fades

1568
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
Oh Richard

1569
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,871
Does not exist

1570
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,687
My father I'm his part of attorney

1571
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
And

1572
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
Two years ago he was riding his bike

1573
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,063
9 miles a day

1574
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
Wow very

1575
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
In state

1576
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
Elderly yes

1577
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
Exercise

1578
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Everyday

1579
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,655
And now he can barely walk to the mailbox without getting out of breath

1580
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
So I took him

1581
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,591
And I wanted some blood work done

1582
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,383
Because he's had

1583
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
3

1584
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Thought

1585
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
And

1586
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
The doctor acted like I was

1587
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Crazy

1588
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Because I explained

1589
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,135
Why wanted this blood work done and I

1590
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,695
Where we went I told my dad

1591
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
What I was concerned about

1592
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Which is back

1593
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
Being induced

1594
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,607
Autoimmune deficiency syndrome

1595
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
And

1596
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
Doctor

1597
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Acted like I was

1598
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Crazy

1599
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
He acted like it was

1600
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
First time hearing

1601
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,759
Meridian Ms information

1602
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Illiterate

1603
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,623
I think that

1604
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,695
You know among people who are in the elderly set

1605
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,279
Sometimes a couple years can be a really

1606
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Turn around

1607
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,863
A lot can change

1608
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
In a

1609
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,935
Relatively short amount of time

1610
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,471
There's a ton

1611
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Of reasons

1612
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,543
The other than vaccines

1613
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,871
They could attribute they could be attributable to what this

1614
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
Dudas

1615
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
Experience

1616
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,759
But I think the cheese

1617
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Jump

1618
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,831
Some conclusions that are not

1619
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
Found it

1620
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
Doctor

1621
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
At the VA

1622
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,183
I might also

1623
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,719
Be a little bit

1624
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,559
I don't I don't know if I want to humor this I mean

1625
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,143
You can't what you going to say to her like hey

1626
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
You know

1627
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,679
Have you ever

1628
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,263
Pizza sidewalk whenever the moon is full

1629
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,871
Full moon didn't do that but you remember the Moon being full of the you associated

1630
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
Did the two of those things together

1631
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,711
Do you see where I'm going with the vaccines in your dad here

1632
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,807
Can you prove that the moon didn't do it

1633
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
She's come to

1634
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,647
Conclusion about what's going on

1635
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
And

1636
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
Also I think

1637
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
That

1638
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:52,767
You know it

1639
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:57,119
Whistle conversation about Hippa rights

1640
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,935
I don't think this is a HIPAA violation necessarily

1641
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
Because

1642
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
There's no identifying

1643
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,543
Information haha you know

1644
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
For these

1645
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,871
Ding-dongs who talked about HIPAA all day long

1646
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,967
Complain about sup this would be an imaginary violate

1647
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,015
Near me

1648
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
Not moving

1649
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,623
Start over with

1650
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,671
Start over with what's in the report

1651
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,487
In the report

1652
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Keystone

1653
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,303
I wanted to know

1654
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,863
And they're low

1655
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
Bestow

1656
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
B as in boy

1657
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
Those are all

1658
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Stolo

1659
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,543
Eating 8

1660
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
Those are your app

1661
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
Depress ourselves

1662
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
Blow

1663
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
And then the key 48

1664
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
Free smells

1665
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,295
Hi

1666
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
And it's very high

1667
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
I looked up

1668
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
What does

1669
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,743
Mercier Tracy Ojai

1670
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
And

1671
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,351
I got instantly on WebMD

1672
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,399
Hodgkin's lymphoma

1673
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
And your listeners to know

1674
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
As much cure say if

1675
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
54

1676
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
I have proof

1677
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
And I

1678
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,063
I feel horrible that I let him get this

1679
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
It was out of Michael

1680
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:26,719
Control to be honest the doctor

1681
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
Lymphoma

1682
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,959
3 clear there's plenty of reasons that aren't lymphoma why someone would have a high ratio of these cells

1683
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,775
Princeton together viral infection I would cause the

1684
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
The same test results

1685
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:46,943
Typically this is a ratio that discuss not in the context of lymphoma but in terms of hiv-aids

1686
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
Which makes sense

1687
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,295
Because this woman did say that she was badgering this VA doctor to test her

1688
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,183
Pixie is this not existing condition of AIDS right

1689
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,231
Interesting Lee you generally find

1690
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
Decrease ratios

1691
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,071
Use of these cells in patients with HIV or Aids so this

1692
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
This test essentially

1693
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
His invalidating her entire argument

1694
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,191
But you came in with

1695
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
Right which is why she had to run to WebMD.

1696
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,824
You find a new thing to focus on and claim their dad got from the vaccine

1697
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,640
There's no good evidence anywhere that cover jacks

1698
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
Cause lymphoma but I think Alex might just be getting

1699
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,224
Confuse

1700
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Cuz the vaccine

1701
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,064
Lymphedema Dental pathy

1702
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,624
Kiewit similar but is actually just swelling

1703
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,184
So I think that's

1704
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,256
Probably what's going on here although I do feel like this is

1705
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Very sad

1706
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Yeah

1707
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,632
Person is a

1708
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
You know like

1709
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
Vizio disinformation

1710
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,800
Yeah I mean Nintendo just a beacon of Education

1711
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,592
System failed and they just

1712
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616
Every part

1713
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
From start to finish that lead

1714
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
Did you hear

1715
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,456
He's not just like

1716
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Her choices

1717
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
Is this is a structural issue

1718
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
Baby to get here

1719
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:00,160
Education system in many other ways she may be very well in

1720
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
Informed and know a lot about a lot of things

1721
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,792
You can be susceptible to

1722
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,192
Lot of dumb narrative I don't know if it's necessarily a failing of education system but

1723
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,984
It's a it's a failing of

1724
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
At least the people who disseminate information like

1725
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
Alex and whatever she's

1726
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
Pulling from

1727
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,432
Have some kind of a responsibility

1728
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,760
The hold themselves accountable for what they're putting out

1729
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
Angie is a victim

1730
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
Some of that for sure

1731
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:28,832
100

1732
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,368
And II

1733
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
A pill for her but I also think

1734
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,464
I mean she's just a person in

1735
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Tympanic who's

1736
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,584
Whose father is it

1737
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
Ghetto like of course

1738
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,704
Trying to find Subway to make the anti-vax argument

1739
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
Fit her

1740
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Particular case

1741
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,568
And it's just a bummer

1742
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,640

1761
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
Remarkable

Which feature is a chiropractor named Brian artist

1768
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,688
Playing with snake venom and the devil

1769
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,784
Here's a synopsis of the documentary from Stu Peters pay

1770
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
Okay

1771
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,904
The plandemic continues but its Origins are still in the farias mystery

1772
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,440
How did the world get sick

1773
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:14,560
How did covid really spread and did the satanic Elite tell the world about this bioweapon ahead

1774
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,328
Time

1775
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:19,680
Dr. Brian artist has unveiled a shocking connection between this

1776
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,520
And the eternal battle of Good and Evil which began in the garden of Eve

1777
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
Wow

1778
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Snake venom

1779
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,688
Naturally artist is using this documentary to sell a collection of

1780
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:39,392
He calls it the Aunt Ivy collection

1781
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
109 dollars

1782
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,232
Supposed to say this is overpriced

1783
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,888
Apparently after the backlash of people making fun of the documentary claiming that the vaccine was meant to inject people to Satan

1784
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,704
DNA Wright artist decided that he should do some damage

1785
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,824
Controls that he's been done Dirty by Peters.

1786
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,360
Recapture is claim

01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:03,200
Pressure is still on the

1788
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,600
The top of Artisans homepage

1789
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,392
Supposed to

1790
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:16,768
Nope a publicity is good publicity I got to sell these hundred and $10 pills

1791
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
I'll take what I can get

1792
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
Limited-time sale price Jesus

01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,376
Yeah but you got done Dirty by

1794
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
Stupider saying

1795
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,960
Cuz that's do the Garden of Eden or some s***

1796
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,240
The snake venom

1797
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:27,776
Conspiracy

1798
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Because

1799
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,128
That gives me some sort of hope you like one thing that it is

1800
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,408
Is Drew about snake venom

1801
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,432
And Engraving

1802
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
Anti-Venom

1803
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Is that

1804
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,064
There's just not a lot of it and it's really hard to get

1805
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,136
It's really hard to milk Venom and is we there's a shortage

1806
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
Of all kinds of venom

1807
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,488
United States

1808
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,536
So in this scenario

1809
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,352
Someone out there is milking enough Venom

1810
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,144
To poison the world

1811
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,960
Would suggest that we won't have to worry about snake bites anymore

1812
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,752
Have you considered

1813
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
The time

1814
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288

Great some Hardee's amazing this is giving you some kind of optimism

1818
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,184
Optimistic too because in response to this call

Alex is like

1820
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,232
This is bulshit

1821
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
A series of Courts

Truly inspired by God like LED

1824
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
Supposition and then

1825
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,776
He was able to kind of

1826
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Masonic me pru

1827
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,128
That coronavirus is actually

1828
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
Snake venom

1829
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,200
Pacifically

1830
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,272
Snakes and the cobra snake

1831
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:47,648
And what's interesting question and

1832
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Virus scan

1833
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,952
Pace University

Virus virus is real replicas

1835
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,376
How much snake venom to put in a water supply

1836
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,448
To have these type of blood clotting infection things

1837

New York

1838
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,480
Blood clots in your leg

1839
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,320
I'm not pooping this one will get our Tucson inside what's the big

1840
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
But

1841
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,392
To to shave it

1842
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,000
It's diluted it breaks down

1843
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
Electrochemically very quickly

1844
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,352
What you want is a virus cuz it

1845
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Replicate to the body

1846
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
Yeah cuz cuz

1847
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
Contagious

1848
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,056
Ears ears how bad it is

1849
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
Your whole in that

1850
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,944
Plot is so big not even Alex

1851
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
Can walk through it safe

1852
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:50,368
He doesn't think it's worth patching off as like well

1853
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,904
Why would I accept this

1854
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,184
It undoes

1855
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,232
Everything I've been saying

1856
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,768
Completely

1857
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Open

1858
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,352
Everything that I claim I've proved the right person

1859
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
I can't do this one

1860
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Also come on

1861
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
Yes I come on

1862
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:10,336
I thought would be I said that would be the most reasonable response I think from Alex

1863
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
Get out of here fairly generous is responding to her because it is I'm not poop this is meant to be short of a

1864
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:24,160
The softening of the blow and then BB like you understand how much venom it would take a toll so

1865
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
Viruses replicate

1866
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,536
You mean they do it on their own

1867
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,888
Kind of nice that he's not just being like this is f****** dumb

1868
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,936
A little bit disconcerting

1869
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:39,264
Have him immediately save the most obvious thing which is

1870
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:44,896
We don't have enough Venom to do that ma'am no one does an element of

1871
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:51,296
He's engaging with this theory on and I signed a defensive that he's capable of it in some

1872
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
Totally second there's an element

1873
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Grace

1874
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,696
But he's showing towards this caller

1875
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:01,024
No and it shows that there is a possibility that

1876
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
If he can act that way towards people

1877
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,584
Which is f***** up

1878
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,864
That is

1879
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,728
Although less unexpected is the idol still interviewing cuz ever want to talk

1880
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
In his field of

1881
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,480
Chiropractors baba baba

1882
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:23,040
Trump says together and drink

1883
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
I bet they did

1884
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,648
So another color

1885
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,440
I think a lot of people

1886
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,512
You know sometimes if you don't engage with Alex's

1887
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,072
Really don't listen to the show you don't recognize how

1888
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,376
Goddamn religiously insane

1889
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,936
Listen to this caller

1890
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,264
Alex Jones my brother in Christ how are you today

1891
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
I'm good brother

1892
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,616
Absolutely the Lord

1893
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,176
Call my heart

1894
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,992
Call and give you an extrication and just let you know

1895
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:56,064
You're a crusader of modern-day

1896
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
Crusader for these times

1897
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Before the return of our Lord and savior

1898
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,952
As you know and you

1899
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,024
We're in the days of Noah or the days of lot

1900
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
And many

1901
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,328
Are just not awake

1902
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,632
But you as a crusader a Lewis leading those

1903
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
At the type like Noah

1904
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,960
As a came up

1905
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,984
To the Sea

1906
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
They look behind them

1907
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
Pharaoh's Army was there

1908
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,312
Today that's

1909
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,080
Oroville

1910
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,896
And what is a sea that is impenetrable

1911
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,944
Afterward says

1912
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,992
New the God Will Make A Way

1913
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,528
Odyssey

1914
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,880
We made it across your leading people in that way into the light into the truth

1915
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
And that's going to lead

1916
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,952
Do Great and Mighty things

1917
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,232
Moses

1918
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,792
Nope

1919
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
No is the plug guy

1920
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,608
The boat

1921
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,936
Yeah yeah I think

1922
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:50,336
There's something troubling about like actually disseminating is information

1923
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Series that is like

1924
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,384
You're f****** Moe's

1925
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,992
You know sometimes

1926
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
I think you know

1927
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
Like listen to this

1928
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,832
Listen to The Wave

1929
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,600
This man is speak

1930
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
And what he saying

1931
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
About Alex

1932
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
And then just

1933
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
Go back in time

1934
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
I meant think

1935
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:11,840
Maybe Moses was just an a****** who said he did all this s***

1936
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,192
Convince enough people to believe it and then everybody forgot that he was full of s***

1937
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:24,128
I just don't like hearing this year don't ask me uncomfortable

1938
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
Coming up another gas

1939
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,016
Ortega's a gas cuz he hasn't had a gas yet

1940
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
Episode butts

1941
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:36,672
It is somebody we have not talked about in a little bit he's somebody who likes

1942
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,440
To get permit

1943
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,488
Four stages for

1944
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,304
I wish you were people that he plans

1945
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,704
To bring their fraudulently you might certainly suspiciously close to

1946
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,752
Somebody like that

1947
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,104
Torch passed to him from rogerdale mustache aficionado

1948
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,152
I think yeah you could say that

1949
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Oh yeah what is back

1950
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,760
Introduction

1951
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,344
Editorial consultant

1952
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208

13 years and

1954
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,656
Understood in philosophy and building a better

1955
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,752
Comport / Alexander

1956
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Gab

1957
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,288
Social

1958
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,312
Ali

1959
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
Telegram

1960
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,896
And more he joins us now

1961
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
Good

1962
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Pivot

1963
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:31,968
Good

1964
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,248
I'm a philosopher

1965
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,552
I'm a loser

1966
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:41,952
Oh sure I was I was previous political

1967
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,232
Activist

1968
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:48,096
Coordinating with Paul gosar and all these other weirdos

1969
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,936
And I was involved in campaign running

1970
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Alex might say

1971
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,520
But now I'm in the philosophy

1972
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Play now cuz

1973
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
It got too hot

1974
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:00,640
Are you saying that you don't think people can change

1975
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
Not Ali

1976
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,040
What is this philosophy that he's pivoted to

1977
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,856
That is going to really kind of blow our minds

1978
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:13,184
Make us forget that he's a month question

1979
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,024
I want to know you have a notepad I will

1980
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,328
Over the course of some of these clips

1981
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,936
Determine what is philosophy

1982
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Mighty

1983
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,056
The first cup maybe not so much philosophical but

1984
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,848
To do with

1985
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,872
Report

1986
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Split his pants

1987
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,664
Periscope Channel

1988
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,968
Like the videos aren't available anymore

1989
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,552
Yeah well you know that it's absolutely fascinating to me I have

1990
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,880
I have my Periscope videos on a

1991
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
Subservice

1992
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,512
Now deleted videos

1993
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,816
Twitter

1994
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,896
You got ready or YouTube your son should know

1995
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:10,528
A news article saying that Ali's videos have since been deleted he did the deleting

1996
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,088
I get to be sensitive but this is a little sad

1997
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,648
Also Alex's situation is entirely different

1998
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:21,536
The reason he's in trouble here is because when he was Sue there was an order for the preservation of materials related

1999
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
The lawsuit

2000
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,864
Prior to his YouTube channel coming down

2001
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:31,264
In the intermediate. No one took any action to preserve the videos that were on the channel that were relevant to the case

2002
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
We cannot be found out

2003
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,848
No one is mad at him for deleting video

2004
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,664
Stacy was that he failed in his duty to preserve a bed

2005
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:44,832
It's a pretty big difference but if Alex gives the appearance of understanding the distinction it becomes too obvious that the courts are depressing him

2006
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:48,160
It all images actions have brought him into the situation that he's

2007
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
And that's an intolerable conclusion

2008
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
For the audience.

2009
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Yeah don't do that

2010
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:59,936
Just making me look dumb

2011
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,752
Dumb you're dumb

2012
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:09,152
Before this couple days before this it was announced that Ali was going to be at a cooperating with the JaneDear

2013
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,920
6 committee

2014
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,224
What's a give a very APA

2015
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,552
Perspective position on this

2016
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:20,928
Disappearance

2017
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:27,328
Parley with the FBI well I mean I assume she is thinking of

2018
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
The great mark

2019
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Aurelius

2020
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
Whatever Marcus said do you know

2021
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,472
I hear you got a you got to pay the piper

2022
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,008
That was a saint August

2023
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
Man I'm

2024
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:43,456
This is why Ali's the philosopher had not made you've got to go with more religiously that's a good point off with Ally

2025
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,272
The stoics were really his bag huh

2026
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:49,344
So Allie has a

2027
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,416
6 committees actually up to

2028
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:58,816
Let me go ahead and break some medicine and only my lawyers and I are weird

2029
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
The January 6th committee

2030
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,984
Is going to try to Outlaw II out out outlaw

2031
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,128
Okay

2032
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,176
I knew this in December

2033
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,456
Okay

2034
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,392
Rodger Stone

2035
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:30,048
A criminal referral piercings were not going to primly refer but we really like wink-wink-nudge-nudge

2036
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,096
The justice department to move on

2037
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,168
Policy recommendations

2038
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:38,496
To keep the right-wing from ever organizing again

2039
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,640
You're going to see recommendations

2040
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:49,504
Increase the regulatory environment for Bitcoin Americans to get it

2041
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,320
Well the rest of the world compete with us on this sovereign

2042
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,088
On the shop

2043
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,696
Various.

2044
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,000
So this is Ali playing a preemptive defense

2045
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:03,072
Game because I suspect that he has a pretty good idea that there were so

2046
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,608
Shady f****** transaction

2047
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:08,192
They were involved in January 6th overdone by Bitcoin

2048
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,752
A telegram is a platform that a lot of them used

2049
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
Plan an Insight people

2050
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,664
This is an attempt to hijack that conversation before it even happens because the ultimate end of it is threatened

2051
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,968
To some aspects of Ali's bran

2052
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Pipe always do

2053
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,344
I wouldn't be too surprised though if there were conversations in the not-too-distant

2054
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,672
Future bathtub more regulation and oversight of Bitcoin

2055
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,232
I don't know how much that's going to involve the jam 6 committee

2056
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,256
Seems like it's just

2057
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
Long overdue

2058
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,608
Some kind of a financial nightmare that comes along

2059
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Probably

2060
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,168
To do with nfte

2061
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,496
Situation where we like

2062
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
Got it

2063
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,336
Make sure this doesn't happen again

2064
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,152
One thing on My Philosophy watch here

2065
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:52,736
He disagrees I would imagine

2066
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,784
With a loud

2067
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,576
Insofar as he

2068
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,368
He does not agree that one who speaks

2069
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,392
Does not know

2070
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
Because he sure f****** toxel

2071
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,768
I think that you're right although I don't think that would be

2072
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,840
Formally codified in his philosophy

2073
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
That's okay

2074
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:12,192
I think what other part of the philosophy that you'll see is like

2075
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,728
Dunno

2076
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,824
Bobby McFerrin don't worry be happy she's kind of I like it

2077
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,408
I'm really happy being studio today

2078
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,272
It's good to be next to somebody's going through some of the same how that we are

2079
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,600
15 months

2080
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:38,560
And then I've been watching the series The Chosen which has been really good

2081
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,864
In Christian friends and they're just like

2082
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
You got a smile through this more Ali

2083
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,520
And so you know I think that I think that like that

2084
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,640
Everybody if you're listening to

2085
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:56,992
You are part of this and you can play a role in this you need a red pill your neighbor

2086
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
You need to make

2087
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,600
Prosthetics

2088
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,392
To you and your neighbors

2089
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
You need to make Prosthetics

2090
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,632
Statements write will later be used

2091
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:20,032
Do promotion phone number to is eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die

2092
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,080
Victini

2093
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:27,968
That's where we're going I thought you were talking about Dave Matthews Band

2094
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,296
1 and 2 in my book on philosophy

2095
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:37,696
4/3 Milly

2096
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,000
I'm just going to two-step

2097
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,024
Into this crap

2098
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,328
Alright today Matthew

2099
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,400
So Allie has a belief that

2100
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,192
The GOP

2101
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,472
They don't

2102
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
Wants to lose

2103
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,312
Right

2104
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Didn't want to win

2105
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,360
Too much

2106
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Obvious

2107
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,432
Is Berwyn too much people want them

2108
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,200
Send to do things

2109
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,760
That's how I would interpret it

2110
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,064
Interpreted more as like

2111
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,344
If they win too much

2112
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,440
Then the people who are going to have major power are like Marjorie Taylor Greene

2113
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,720
Paul gosar

2114
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:13,536
These Fringe figures will have more of an influence

2115
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,608
Where is Sav small victory

2116
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,168
Kevin McCarthy will stay being able to whip

2117
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
People into place

2118
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
To get things

2119
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:22,752
Where is

2120
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:28,384
I don't think I don't think that makes much sense because if they've a small victory then the conservative people like

2121
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,784
Marge has have more power or more because they will be the deciding factor whether or not something I actually

2122
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
I mean

2123
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Is is

2124
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,904
What that's V exact opposite of how it actually works

2125
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,928
But

2126
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,208
Babies

2127
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
Ali is

2128
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,256
Promoting or what

2129
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:50,656
Suggest a prophetic statement that later on we'll get people to listen to Infowars

2130
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,752
Would be the best thing possible for 100%

2131
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
But now that they

2132
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,592
GOP only one

2133
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,152
You have to think about this way

2134
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,968
Kevin McCarthy gets too large

2135
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
The conservatives are in control

2136
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,064
Kevin McCarthy just gets a little off the tip top

2137
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:15,488
Control

2138
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
A reversed A6 committee

2139
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,864
Investigate

2140
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,680
Any FBI setup

2141
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:37,760
So they can control it and a 2024

2142
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,552
By taking Trump off of a ballad

2143
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
I was frustrating

2144
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,720
Is Ali

2145
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,536
I like that at the end

2146
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
Daddy's

2147
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,328
So dumb

2148
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,912
Something that if you said that in

2149
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,680
Any kind

2150
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
Reasonable space

2151
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,264
The person sitting across from you would have to laugh

2152
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:05,664
Some of these priorities that alley Hazard is never going to happen anyway

2153
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,224
You had a giant

2154
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,272
Majority in the house or not

2155
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,552
But I think

2156
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,600
The possibility of having some like

2157
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:17,696
Trivial ass going nowhere committee or something like that

2158
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:23,840
Marjorie Taylor Greene wants to start I think the likelihood of that is much higher there's a small victory

2159
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:27,168
Because she could use whatever leverage she has in terms of

2160
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:30,752
Passing something that is a priority for Kevin McCarthy

2161
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,056
Do like you have to put me on this thing

2162
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,848
Right I will go along with your caca

2163
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,408
Make any sense

2164
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:41,760
It appears that Allie does not understand how negotiating power structures

2165
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
Like the

2166
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,600
The more you need from me

2167
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,392
And the more power I have

2168
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,696
The more likely I am

2169
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
To get what I want

2170
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,816
In exchange for giving you what you want simple

2171
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,864
If there is a 60 /

2172
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,424
Republican thing in the house

2173
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,312
Your one vote does not really know hold as much clout as it would in the alternative

2174
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:11,712
So I don't know but which is why Joe manchin is the singularly capable of destroying the world

2175
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:18,112
Because the Lesser majority is the more likely you are to have two more important

2176
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:24,000
Leon Bibb thing I love those

2177
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,584
I know they do so excited

2178
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:31,936
So a little bit of here about January

2179
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
Defendants

2180
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,032
Deeply problematic

2181
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,336
Let me tell the government

2182
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
Yes

2183
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,920
I regularly talk to Jay six defendant lawyers

2184
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,200
Over 30 of them

2185
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,272
And they tell me about the evidence

2186
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
Only secure laptops

2187
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:00,352
And this evidence in one case exonerate

2188
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:04,192
Moving train wreck

2189
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,040
And then they get a harsher sentence because they didn't quit work

2190
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,800
That motion

2191
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:45,408
If there's actual evidence exonerating that these lawyers are in possession of

2192
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,200
Could get it in front of a judge

2193
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:51,040
Even if it is confidential or something like that if they have this

2194
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:54,624
They be able to presented the only way they wouldn't is if they didn't

2195
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,648
Attempt to

2196
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:00,768
I suspect he is talking about isn't so much evidence as it is

2197
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
Heavy insinuation

2198
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:06,656
This is the kind of thing that is called evidence I probably wouldn't

2199
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,960
Play in an actual Court

2200
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:13,568
It's kind of persuasive in the court of public opinion I feel like that's what Ally is talking

2201
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,664
Also if Allie is telling the truth in January 6

2202
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,272
Defense lawyers are leaking privileged information to hit that easy then discussing on Infowars

2203
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
That is a gigantic

2204
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,368
Confidentiality problem and there could be some real consequence

2205
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
This for that

2206
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,672
Dealers might be risky

2207
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,488
Disbarment which honestly wouldn't be too surprising

2208
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,072
Considering the Ali's last lawyer Jonathan Moseley was Justice

2209
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,096
Disbarred for breaking

2210
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,632
6 rules of professional,

2211
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
Yasso

2212
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,728
I don't know

2213
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:46,080
I would stop insinuating that you're in contact with lawyers who are doing things that would

2214
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
Probably get them

2215
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:51,200
Does bar it is kind of amazing

2216
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,736
That

2217
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,504
Despite

2218
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
TV

2219
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,320
Massive amount of

2220
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,856
Consequences coming their way

2221
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,136
Through the legal system

2222
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,440
None of them have really spend enough

2223
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,488
What time like educating themselves on how this

2224
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
This is going to work

2225
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,584
You know like it is there so many things where you're like no your

2226
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,936
Did that's know what but what are you doing in this case I think I was just talkingshit

2227
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,568
Vicki probably is actually putting any of these lawyers in jeopardy

2228
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
I think that

2229
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,664
He's not saying anything specific but he's

2230
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,944
Being

2231
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,528
These drunk posture of revealing privileged information

2232
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,344
And that could be

2233
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,624
Courts do not

2234
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,392
Look up

2235
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,672
Probably doesn't go over

2236
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,464
Maybe not disbarment

2237
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,000
But certainly some kind of Accenture

2238
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:38,560
I mean I'm imagining that it's

2239
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,864
Quite putting out a million-dollar bounty

2240
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Fights

2241
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
Yeah

2242
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,192
That's actually

2243
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
Totally cool

2244
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:53,152
No I do not I have never been needing to disappear

2245
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:53,920
Beer into the woods

2246
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
That means that you still get

2247
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,992
The protest

2248
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:10,816
We survived the tea party we survive the

2249
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,632
Shooting controversies

2250
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:17,984
Still you can wear Melissa

2251
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,032
January 6th

2252
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,592
Peaceful protest

2253
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
If you wear camouflage

2254
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,688
Any protests across this country

2255
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,784
BFDI can identify you

2256
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
Associated with you

2257
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
And you get

2258
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,904
Profile creative

2259
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,696
He sounds like an excited

2260
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,720
Angry baby

2261
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:41,536
Yeah I mean people complain about me being

2262
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,584
Screaming loud all the type of cheese

2263
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
That's annoying

2264
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,400
And also like

2265
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
I think

2266
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,448
That's

2267
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,776
I am flabbergast

2268
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,056
I said the idea that

2269
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,408
The FBI would open files on anybody who wore camo

2270
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,248
Protests it's ludicrous

2271
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,808
Yeah

2272
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:06,880
But that would be typifying is

2273
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,184
I know that our government likes to

2274
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Yeah I mean

2275
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,840
I suppose

2276
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,632
Maybe the best you

2277
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,936
Could save for that is just like

2278
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,216
Yeah the people who

2279
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,264
Did the whole you know

2280
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,336
Zip tie handcuffs and everything

2281
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
They were tagged

2282
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,640
For good reason

2283
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,176
It wasn't just cuz they were

2284
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,832
But That's Amore individual actions not clothing

2285
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,648
It's insane

2286
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,184
You know how many

2287
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,464
Camo

2288
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,792
Designs

2289
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,072
What is camo

2290
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:50,144
If you're going to say that what is camo

2291
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:55,264
Sweeter as if you wore like a pattern of a Chamberlain

2292
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,360
Fence that could be one of those pictures that have

2293
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:02,432
People paint you in the back

2294
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:06,528
That seems like maybe a Taskmaster episode

2295
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:10,624
Real camo be like wearing a regular ass t-shirt and jeans

2296
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,440
You're going to get on the list for that

2297
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Anyway

2298
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,024
This is this is where I think some floss

2299
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
If he comes at 2

2300
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,632
Holly Alexander how do we stop

2301
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,448
A Civil War the globalists and Trauma trigger

2302
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
How do we deescalate

2303
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,200
What

2304
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,272
Some of the conspiracy

2305
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,832
Satan's domain

2306
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,904
Because I

2307
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:44,928
You know

2308
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:47,744
Uef all this stuff way more than I have

2309
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,304
For over 25 years

2310
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,144
I have a great understanding of campaigns large organizations and government

2311
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:59,264
But I don't see something like this fully cooperating with each other without a supernatural Force

2312
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,056
Influencing

2313
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
Yeah

2314
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,872
Here's what I say

2315
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:04,896
Guilty

2316
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,968
That's what I say

2317
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,736
To that

2318
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,528
Honestly

2319
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,064
All evidence

2320
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,368
All trial base everything is done

2321
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,648
That guy said that

2322
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
Because he did it

2323
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,440
Duh

2324
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,208
Come on

2325
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,232
Come on

2326
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
You don't say that

2327
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,072
Crazy person says that

2328
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:27,424
You might as well have been like I wanted over there yet those

2329
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,728
Conspiracy goes so far

2330
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
But then

2331
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:34,080
Not guilty how can people

2332
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,384
Do things with Supernatural

2333
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:39,712
Haha

2334
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,296
Ali Ali is a little bit much

2335
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600
I ate you know

2336
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,928
Sing today's I started to realize that I didn't miss

2337
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,488
But still I hate this is the word

2338
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,584
Though I do think that he is the kind of cat who comes on and

2339
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,936
Ends up a little bit

2340
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,544
A conservative publisher

2341
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,104
Explain to that conservative publisher

2342
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,896
You don't need to convince the

2343
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
The public

2344
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,456
They need to chill

2345
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,784
Ping pong between the two parties

2346
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
Districts in America

2347
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:23,232
Fulton County it's Orange County in California

2348
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,280
This mini seats and so

2349
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,120
Okay with these things

2350
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,448
And white women

2351
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,240
Being called a racist

2352
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:38,592
But they don't like CRT

2353
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,944
Yeah we got a hammer

2354
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,224
I was advising

2355
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:47,040
Giant Republican organizations

2356
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
I would say

2357
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:51,648
Trt is something that the Tea Party Stop the ceiling Trump wasn't

2358
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,488
Five-year-old white babies on rice

2359
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,424
I think this is a little cynical

2360
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
Wow

2361
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,520
So I think I think

2362
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,312
Dates

2363
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,592
That's kind of just a good

2364
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,360
Summation of

2365
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,128
Love how

2366
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
How

2367
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:17,504
I think of you here similar things

2368
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,576
Is that art is Craven and cynical in terms of like

2369
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
What messaging surrounding

2370
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,416
The medicare-for-all

2371
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Is

2372
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:29,024
What messaging is most attractive to

2373
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:29,792
XYZ

2374
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,144
In a largely surrounding an issue that is real

2375
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,168
Where is

2376
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,752
Trt and all that stuff is a manufactured problem

2377
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,568
That they're like oh yes if we drive this

2378
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:46,944
Messaging surrounding this there's not an issue it scares white women

2379
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,248
And it'll Inspire enough to vote that week

2380
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,272
You can flip a couple things

2381
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
Yeah I mean

2382
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,392
Justice idea that Alyssa

2383
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:57,440
It does not matter if

2384
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,720
Trt

2385
01:51:58,976 --> 01:51:59,744
Means anything

2386
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,792
It doesn't matter if

2387
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,816
What we're talking about

2388
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,608
Is educating people about races

2389
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,400
It does not bad that's

2390
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,192
Nowhere important

2391
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
What's important

2392
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:14,080
Is making people think that if you go to school your kids are going to tell you you're a racist

2393
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:20,480
Wow wow mommy already we've got to vote for republicans

2394
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
So they can

2395
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
Wait

2396
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
So then they can

2397
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,624
Dominate the critical race Theory

2398
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,648
And then that would

2399
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,440
Lower the status of so

2400
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
Okay so they're just race

2401
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:36,352
So there's one last clip here in Ellie has an interesting take

2402
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,888
On how

2403
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
People like you and me I would guess

2404
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,704
If he was at

2405
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,728
To talk to us

2406
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,776
You would look at us as like cavemen

2407
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,824
Weird we work we're back

2408
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,848
Words thinking

2409
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,384
Folks

2410
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:52,480
Bluewater religiously ordered Society

2411
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,272
There was a real innovate

2412
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,344
Are the real forward-thinking Google

2413
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,368
Google havlik

2414
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Stop 10K

2415
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:08,352
Consciousness consciousness

2416
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632
Consciousness and get it

2417
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:16,032
Yeah and

2418
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,336
He said there's a different way

2419
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,920
And by the way now it's Universal

2420
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:24,736
We need to have a different way of saying

2421
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,808
We believe in these archetypes and we believe in the tradition

2422
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
Work for Humanity

2423
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,912
We need to move.

2424
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,728
Cuz the new model

2425
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,288
It's super weird because their archaic

2426
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:56,736
You know where are the people who are dreaming of alien coming together

2427
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,024
We are always seeking on the right

2428
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,072
To commune with God

2429
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:14,912
In innovative ways

2430
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,448
Civil Society

2431
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
That's

2432
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,496
Fascinating

2433
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:22,336
I think I think Allie might want to unpack

2434
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:24,128
How the church

2435
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,432
Was just like the only people who had money

2436
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,480
At a certain time

2437
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:33,856
Certain things like art also take a little bit of a step back and recognize

2438
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,440
A massive censorship that was involved in what

2439
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,720
The church would

2440
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,656
But he was supposed to say will probably be fine

2441
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,936
With that kind of rank

2442
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:51,008
Centralized censorship

2443
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,824
Because they would be censoring things that he

2444
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Himself likes

2445
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:55,872
For him

2446
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
But he does not want

2447
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,688
The culture to enjoy

2448
01:54:59,200 --> 01:54:59,712
And when

2449
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,760
This happens as it always does

2450
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,296
People go away

2451
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,600
I didn't know you were going to do that

2452
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
This has gotten out of like

2453
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,160
Control and now we have

2454
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:14,816
Yeah maybe maybe that's true

2455
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,352
But yeah I think

2456
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,632
I think his conception

2457
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,912
Seems a little bit Limited

2458
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
In terms of

2459
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,728
The the

2460
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,776
Did the extent to which

2461
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,336
The church was interested in

2462
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
The Arts

2463
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
I mean as in somebody well

2464
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,944
Miami Avenue

2465
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,224
Appreciator of music

2466
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
Prefer somebody to

2467
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:35,808
Claim

2468
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,088
Straight face

2469
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:40,160
The church brought brought Harmony to music

2470
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:45,024
Is it insulting I don't know what level of proportion can exist but it is that

2471
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,608
I looked into it and I regret to inform you that the church

2472
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:55,008
Holy s*** that's crazy how did they do it

2473
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,544
Yes but that would make

2474
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,944
I don't know I don't claim Christianity is responsible for their being 7

2475
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,712
Billion people

2476
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Is the world

2477
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
I mean

2478
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,576
That the things that he just said that

2479
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,112
Are so rude

2480
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Ridiculous

2481
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
To claim

2482
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,928
That I am mean

2483
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,696
He would

2484
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,768
If he was ever pressed to actually believe that stuff

2485
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:20,352
Now you know I was saying this

2486
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:27,008
I've brought up about alley in the past number of times

2487
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,544
Yeah

2488
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,568
It's

2489
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,104
Really outrageous

2490
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,640
Some of the stuff that he ends up

2491
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,712
First of all summer just dumb

2492
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:42,112
Yeah man some of it is stuff like January 6th had to be the devil's doing because how do you coordinate all these people.

2493
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,416
Supernatural for guilty

2494
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,952
Okay man

2495
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,488
Wow why do you talk public

2496
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,280
I mean you know

2497
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:54,144
It is it is kind of a an example of something that always exist

2498
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,192
In this type of a movement which

2499
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,496
She's just a person who's willing to say any

2500
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,544
A lot of those people

2501
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,080
Well yeah I mean

2502
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:07,712
That's fair

2503
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,480
Anyting

2504
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,016
Just an Ethan

2505
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
Wild

2506
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,112
How do you how do you go to

2507
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
Sleep at night

2508
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:19,232
You know people ask that whenever they talk to serial killers and that kind of thing

2509
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:21,280
And I think they're serial killers they probably saw

2510
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
How does he sleep at night

2511
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,120
His brain has

2512
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,448
Just be filled with like reasons that people hate him

2513
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:33,056
He sleeps on

2514
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:34,848
I don't know

2515
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:35,872
I8

2516
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,920
These people are a mystery to me

2517
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,200
But

2518
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,760
I think they are

2519
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,296
I have some trouble,

2520
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,600
