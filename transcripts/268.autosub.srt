00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
Hubbard Woods

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
If you were if you

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
You had to be a bird

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
I feel like

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
Cardinals

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
I'm from Missouri

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
The love our baseball

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
Everybody off

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,336
I'm not sure they do I just think

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,456
I want to be a Birdseye do the Cardinals

14
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,016
There's another consideration

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,808
Lucknow

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
No further dumb

17
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Encino we've learned a lot about you don't like seeds all that much like flowers

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Show me

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
It's like whatever they eat

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,752
Looks great in a fly fly

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,592
Teen Wolf t-shirt I don't care

22
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,944
Speed flying is clearly too much of a risk you run into things all the time

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Do I live original life

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,184
When I used to work at Walgreens

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
My life here in Chicago I just moved everything was going bad

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
No stand-up was not going wild the job sucks

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
I was miserable but I couldn't leave because I needed

28
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
One day I'm out on a smoke break

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm in front of the

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
The the store

31
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,664
Smoking cigarette in a bird falls out of the sky in front of me dead

32
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
It was at that moment I realized I do not want to be with her

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,624
Walgreens Sycamore

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
Call Workout

35
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Was like

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
It was like someone was writing a story for

37
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Good

38
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
I want to be a bird okay alright but I do want to know more about Alex

59
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
But you were listening out there

60

We're doing is we are staying in 2012

64
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Investigation

65
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
What happened

66
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
When Alex Jones is coverage after Sandy Hook

67
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
Investigation

68
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Important for us to find our feet

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
You know find our base

70
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Stop before we

71
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Have breaks in

72
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
Episodes

73
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
We're developing

74
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
Moore guitar

75
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Brownstone

76
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Currently all are base belong to them

77
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
The right

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Be doing

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,471
You know

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
For now

81
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
It's

82
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
I don't know.

83
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,135
I guess it felt like I had appointment to start talkin about

84
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
December 17th and 18th

85
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
Lest we Wuesthoff we covered the Sunday show on the 6th

86
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Alex was

87
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
I found his moral Center it was defending

88
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,591
And now we have

89
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Back to the regular

90
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
And you wonder if that's going to change

91
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Fuelvend is Sunday show

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
And I'll say a lot of it is still too

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Just about to send it

94
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
I'm not surprised

95
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
He's going to spend the next

96
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,119
Being like

97
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
But there are some interesting developments

98
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Pieces of her

99
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
His rhetoric that enter the conversation

100
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
Versation

101
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
In the past

102
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
Cuz it just gave me an opportunity

103
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
And its first clip is actually a great example of that

104
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Alex trying to read

105
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
Enforces insinuation

106
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
That the government probably did Sandy Hook

107
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
Without.

108
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Compared it to all these other things

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,911
These are fake whether it's the Aurora shooting right Kaczynski

110
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
That sort of stuff

111
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Of History

112
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,199
Operation

113
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Defied

114
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,999
Someone on from the 50s

115
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
Is all over Europe

116
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
Celebrities and disarm the people

117
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
So

118
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,783
He's trying to insinuate with his talk of operation gladio

119
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Nobody ever brings up operation Sajak

120
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Because

121
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
It's very red

122
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
You never know

123
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
Never know

124
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,423
So whenever Alex wants to suggest something some kind of tragedy is fake

125
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
To prove that what he saying isn't Ludacris

126
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,823
They have any real defensibility can point to his

127
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Aurora shooting

128
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
The time like he's not being crazy

129
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
He'll inevitably bring up operation gladio

130
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
And with less regularity operation

131
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,743
Both of these clandestine operations that the government was involved into an extent

132
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
F***** up pieces of our history

133
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
But if you take a closer look at them

134
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
You'll see that neither of them really helped reinforce the point that he's trying to make

135
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Namely that the United States government is for

136
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Weekly fine with killing their own civilian

137
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
In order to take out

138
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:51,199
Operation gladio refers to the state behind networks place in countries throughout Europe after

139
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
The world war

140
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
3

141
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Creating

142
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,879
It was obviously they were worried about the Warsaw Pact

143
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
And having people in place in the country

144
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Countries

145
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Involve to deal with that possibility

146
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
Was Dean preferable to having large standing army

147
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
Or doing what they were doing

148
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
People who were allied with the cause of fighting

149
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,615
Reunions but it was so disorganized they would rely on like

150
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,687
Late night supply drops

151
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
And fractured communication

152
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Believe

153
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
The people right in secret operation were

154
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
The best way to do it

155
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,255
I don't know

156
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
This also part of Operation Dumbo Drop

157
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,471
Different

158
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Because I'm not really sure that I can

159
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
Say that I'm an expert on the factors that led to these countries choosing that path

160
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Dishonest

161
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,063
That means a lot of claims about operation gladio

162
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Conspiracy circles

163
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Better not

164
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Reflective of

165
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
Most fat but based solely on a stump

166
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
One of these days

167
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Is that the CIA was involved in

168
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
Another is that the stay behind networks in

169
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Countries committed false flag terrorism

170
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
In order to achieve their political goal

171
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
The basic idea gear

172
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Is it these groups

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
The threat of the invasion

174
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
That never came

175
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
So in order to proceed

176
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
The agenda that they were created to push

177
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
The appearance of that threat needed

178
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Created

179
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Enough these groups

180
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Began fake Terror attacks

181
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
To blame their political enemies

182
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
Create the perception of Soviet

183
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Infiltration or whatever

184
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Horses are communist

185
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Did in fact

186
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
That is what the

187
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Conspiracy World believe

188
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
We do not

189
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Know for a fact

190
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
No

191
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
2004 book by daniele Ganser

192
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,319
I called NATO secret armies operation gladio and terrorism

193
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
I'm almost certain that this is where Alex is getting his ideas gladieux from because his version of it and wanted the book

194
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Almost

195
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,887
News about dancers book is it really so much a book that contains documented history

196
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
As much as it is a book full of information

197
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Mixed up with unfounded assumptions

198
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639

His information is used in a book

203
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
And you excited in the bibliography

204
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
Olaf found that his primary research as being

205
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Wheatley misrepresented by cancer

206
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
The many unfounded allegations

207
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Answer except

208
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
Nicest Oracle findings would fill an entire book

209
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
Are the reviews of his book followed similar pattern

210
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,919
Hayden Peak and expert who's frequently published in journals regarding intelligence and operations

211

Took a little bit of a stronger atonement olav

212
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Quote proof is a problem

213
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
For dancer

214
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,647
He complained that the outside he was unable to find any official sources to support his charger

The cia's or any Western European government involvement

With gladia

217
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Nevertheless

218
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,887
His book devotes 14 chapters Duty quote secret war in various Western Nation

219
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Amazon his

220
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Dancer fails to document history

221
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
14

222
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Who doesn't know any

223
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
There's zero information

224
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
He had zero information

225
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
0 documented facts

226
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,135
That is really ringing blood out of a stone

227
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,975
Finish this quote

228
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
The CIA and MI6

229

Gladio intuitive

230
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Which is the fundamental assumption

231
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,751
Charged the belief that Alex has

232
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
SeaWorld pass

233
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Conspiracy

234
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Siri yeah

235
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
It was v18

236
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,295
Could have been

237
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Map

238
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
At least the ideas 1000

239
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Especially considering that in 2005 it was revealed that a lot of narrative relies on a historical

240
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
30 took to be off that

241
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,783
This is what's known as supplement be to the US Army Field Manual 30-31

242
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Which purports to be a classified section of

243
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
The very real field manual 30-31 but is in fact a forgery

244
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Play Soviet distance from

245
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
The forged document

246
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
Contains exactly what Alex Jones

247
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
There may be times when host country government show passivity or indecision in the face of communist or communist Inspired Silver

248
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
And react with intelligence test

249
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
B transmitted by q-shi

250
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Such situations are

251
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Particularly likely to

252
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
He seeks to achieve tactical advantage

253
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Violin

254
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
The swelling host country authorities into a state of false security

255
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
In such cases US Army intelligence must have the means of launching special operation

256
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
Which will convince the host country government

257
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,959
And public opinion of the reality of the necessity

258
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Counteraction

259
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
To this and US Army intelligence

260
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,615
Penetrate the Insurgency

261
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
With a forming Special A

262
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
Radical elements of the Insurgency

263
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
When the kind of situation and visit

264
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Envisaged above arises

265
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Actually under US Army intelligence

266
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Controls should be used to launch violent or non-violent

267
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
According to the nature of

268
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,607
Basically the protocols of the writers of the field manager

269
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Yeah

270
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
Russian propaganda

271
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
Right sounds great

272
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:13,407
Right he should have known it was a forgery when he saw that it was written in crayon though that isn't

273
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,735
Redfin

274
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,671
Exactly everything is right or whatever

275
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
It's not

276
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
If you exclude this document that serious Scholars informal investigation

277
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Route to be a forgery

278
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,703
Networks that were part of operation gladio actually committed any

279
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Any false flag terrorism

280
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Completely

281
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Lee falls apart

282
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
In the interest of fairness

283
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
There have been some indications the old weapons caches

284
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Gladiator Style

285
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Networks

286
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
And even if that's a far cry from

287
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
Proving that the CIA or MI6

288
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Converted these groups into terrorist

289
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
There's a hundred other explanation

290
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
I don't take that to the

291
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Like a good

292
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Piece of Heaven

293
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
From Alex

294
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Operation gladio for me

295
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
I'm still bummed about the 14 chapter

296
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,199
Hard time writing that much when I do have

297
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
That's

298
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Yeah but if you think

299
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
You're like a

300
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Breaking something

301
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
The world

302
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Change the world

303
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Imagining

304
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
If those

305
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
So he's writing like Jack Kerouac

306
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
Flooring tomorrow

307
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Gotcha

308
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
I'm a Operation Ajax Jordan

309
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
Amor real

310
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Correctly

311
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
That operation refers to the cia's 19

312
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
53 overthrow of Mohammed mossadegh and the reinstallation

313
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Peshawar

314
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Dictatorship over a rock

315
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,295
Something underhanded what you could easily call evil

316
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
He doesn't really work to help Alex's point about the

317
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
The globalist doing false flags in the United

318
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
41 pretty big reason

319
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And that is a motive

320
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
Operation Ajax happen because

321
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Was leading a massively Popular Drive

322
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
To nationalize the oil at the British company

323
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
The anglo-iranian oil,

324
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
Which was a threat to a lot of people

325
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,943
The CIA rationalized overthrowing

326
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Oberon

327
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
All the oil be in the hands of communist

328
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
Termination for sovereign state

329
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
53

330
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,639
Riots were manufactured in the Shop-Vac from Power with the full support of the US government

331
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Because they knew he would be easier

332
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
That is a choice that was my

333
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
That is kind of how we do to

334
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,135
I know history is more complicated than that brief summation of it but the

335
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Is the Alex is way out of line

336
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Evidence

337
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
All of his narratives are built on the backs of people who

338
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Who existed solely to demonize,

339
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,239
He loves the John Birch Society and all the most virulent anti-communist

340
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Weasels you can find

341
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
Evil in the namesake

342
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
It's not communism

343
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
I guess what that's exactly the reasoning the CIA uses

344
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Is propaganda

345
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
Justify reinstalling the show-off go up to be a dictator of Iran for

346
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,951
Afterwards

347
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
And what guides

348
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Sort of philosophy and worldview is exactly the same thing

349
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
That the CIA used to justify their actions

350
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Yeah

351
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
That's ironic

352
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
It is a little bit it's a little ironic

353
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
We move along

354
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
You know what just happened

355
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
And where he's staying

356
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Amazon December

357
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
Crocodile tears

358
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
If every disgusting out

359
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
So Obama is giving his speech where he cries

360
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Alex

361
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Dead certain

362
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
But he was fake crying

363
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
Which is also

364
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Deeply ironic

365
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,503
Man

366
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
He's milking this for everything it's worth and it's like dude

367
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,511
Yeah yeah

368
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Milking this

369
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,887
Play it gets worse as we go along

370
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,239
Just like hey can we not have kids anymore

371
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Yeah

372
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
Idea of getting emotional is not

373
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
I don't know I think I take that

374
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,551
Certainly was more authentic that

375
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Absolutely

376
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
The first instance of

377
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
To major in

378
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Episode

379
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
Projecting onto Obama

380
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
What he would do in these circumstances

381
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
So the first one here is fake cry

382
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
You see the Obama crying on television

383
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
He's like that

384
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:30,079
He's like every time I cry it's fake so it must be fake with this guy any any outpouring or expression

385
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,895
Emotion that shows

386
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
Non masculinity analysis definition

387
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
Performative

388
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
I know cuz I do it all the time

389
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Depth

390
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
But I think he would

391
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
You know you wouldn't

392
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Be saying that if he was

393
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Shooting

394
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,679
Do suspicious but you know what he's not the only one

395
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
At least.

396
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
In still occupied Texas

397
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Drums are going

398
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
What's going on

399
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
Cuz you didn't do it

400
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,024
You do if it's a right-wing terrorist all the time and it's all just baked

401
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,376
Why isn't that so much more has happened when there's a Republican president in office

402
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
It would encourage

403
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
As if it were a real right-wing terrorist impossible Ouroboros

404
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
Ozark

405
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
No because the globalist are now panic

406
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
Because of how powerful and popular Trump is

407
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
They're going into overdrive

408
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
Of course it is it's all in French

409
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:29,632
No matter what no matter what happens

410
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Even worse argument because

411
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Cuz it's a bad idea

412
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,080
Don't disagree with that series about

413
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Globalist

414
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Them coming up with utterly silly and stupid plans

415
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
But he thinks he's going to take down

416
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Mainly because they're so stupid

417
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
It would be hard

418
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
No

419
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Which plants

420
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,936
Now so they're doing more right-wing terror attack

421
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,752
It's only going to inspire more right-wing Terror

422
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
Because it doesn't seem like in the instances

423
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,832
Anything against the right-wing has actually been.

424
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:27,488
Dry well

425
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Massive calling all of us

426
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Harrah's or Patriots

427
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,448
Like 2 seconds

428
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
It shows a little bit of a

429
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
I'm really mad at

430
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
These hypothetical imaginary people are bad at their imaginary jobs

431
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,088
Yeah frustrating

432
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
He's being blamed

433
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
For this because he always

434
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
The always personally blame

435
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
4 thing

436
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
He doesn't understand what's going on in the world

437
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Like that

438
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
People are actually saying

439
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Right here

440
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
It is incredible

441
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,008
Especially cuz I was referring to an article in foreign policy not foreign affairs

442
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,848
But it seems like he's talking about it doesn't realize those are two

443
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Which does not inspire,

444
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
That's not a good time

445
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,272
Beyond that he clearly didn't read this article you just read the headline

446
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
The body of the text discusses how a lot of preppers are acting out of rational concerns about be ready for a disaster

447
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:06,304
Walk them real fast whenever came top or something like that

448
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:11,936
The article is about early indications that Adam Lanza's mom was a bit of a survivalist prepper

449
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
But if Alex could read the article it says

450
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Quote

451
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
The extremity of Adam Lanza's crime

452
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Has created a desperate desire for explanation

453
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
And dismissive him is a crazy survivalist or the son of a crazy survivalist

454
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,064
Will likely prove irresistible for many people trying to make sense of assets

455
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
But the ultimate truth of his motive

456
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
Is not likely to be Sosa

457
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Simplistic

458
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
Additional information will emerge over the coming days

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,608
But we've never know really why Lanza killed his mother and so many innocent

460
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Pictures of children

461
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
Understanding the context of his actions May provide

462
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
Useful insights that

463
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
I could prevent future incidents

464
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
But gross oversimplification

465
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Will only stand

466
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
The article is literally a voice of caution warning people that labeling Lanza as a prepper and using that to explain

467
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,600
Latest Act is somehow something that will stand in the way of future understand

468
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
The tragedy

469
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
Literally the opposite of analysis that

470
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
Alex could ever actually like

471
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Disregarding the fact that Alex can't

472
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Those sentences would like

473
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:21,568
Just short-circuited braids like he would wait out and it would just be on the floor and they be like

474
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,664
Pretend he claims to read those are simple

475
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Exactly

476
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
It's not it's supportive of his worldview

477
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,192
Because he's reporting on this stuff in the wake of

478
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,264
Giant mass shooting at an elementary school

479
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,568
He can't play fast and loose with this stuff

480
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Really

481
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
He is

482
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
A couple years later

483
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
It's that oversimplifications only stand in the way

484
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,208
Sentence of this article from the other side

485
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
If it doesn't even matter what they say

486
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Hear the words when Alex

487
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Reads the word oversupply

488
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Flip acacian

489
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
He's like smell that's what I do

490
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,032
Don't tell me not to oversimplify that's the only thing I know how to do

491
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Which might be why I mean it's probably best if you

492
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
If he just came out with it and said

493
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,344
I don't care much for articles

494
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
I like to just read headlines

495
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,512
He could pull off like his I'm a Gerald Celente style Trends forecaster

496
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
All you need is a headlight

497
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:52,704
Friend right or whatever but

498
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
He wouldn't be able to pretend

499
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
He's really smart

500
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Exactly

501
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Kind of

502
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
He has read over 100 books on World War

503
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
I guess

504
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
That's okay

505
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
That's fine

506
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
The title

507
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
So we're still

508
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Serta wanting to say

509
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Relating

510
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Two other things

511
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Things are fake

512
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
And that sort of thing

513
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
And next clip there's another

514
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:29,056
Lost the trust of the people

515
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,648
So it's all right getting ready to plan and Stage more steaks

516
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Stuff like that

517
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:50,048
It's not really clear a few things took was one at there will be more

518
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Or is it the other one

519
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Detox about

520
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
As a little bit of like

521
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
50

522
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Shrubbery around the

523
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
The house

524
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Of our invest

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Navigation

526
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
It's just more it's more evidence that you just thinks everything

527
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
I don't like

528
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
I mean

529
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
If you are saying

530
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Immediately following

531
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,160
They are planning to Stage warm

532
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
It follows that you think that

533
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Mass shooting with

534
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Take that

535
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Yeah

536
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
Crazy give them to take that understanding for those works

537
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
Benefits

538
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Give you a little bit of the flavors

539
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Get back to talking about gun-grabbing

540
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
These gun grabbers

541
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
They're going around they want to Grabagun

542
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Don't grab guns

543
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
Ask people politely to give

544
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Boy better

545
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Guns don't respond well to

546
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
You polite request

547
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
I don't respond well

548
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,104
Where are you

549
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
At war with them

550
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
How many says something else

551
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
In the same way is that

552
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
Clip a couple one

553
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
It's sort of unclear if

554
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
Referring to

555
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
Hook about

556
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Shootings being

557
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Fake butt

558
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Exactly

559
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
It's only reasonable

560
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Assume

561
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
That the one that is most recent

562
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
She has been talking about is what he's referring to

563
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Right

564
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
The system is

565
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,064
Fountain City

566
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:53,184
Martial law

567
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,312
Video game head

568
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
So the simulation

569
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Yeah

570
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Cough

571
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,064
Because I actually forgot that you literally said that kids yeah

572
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
That one that one says this is fake

573
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Really

574
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Maryland

575
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,960
What verse what does he mean by that you mean that they created that simulation

576
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,360
Because if they called that simulation before then it would only make sense for them to then have followed

577
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
Through with it

578
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
Or they're simulating Fallout

579
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
From where

580
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
No there's no one version of that isn't that

581
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
What

582
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
The shooting itself

583
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,632
Whether or not the government staged it or not

584
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
Yeah

585
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,752
Referring to is the way it's Being Framed by the media

586
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Or something like that

587
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah I could see it being a position

588
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
He could defend

589
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,200
It's been no

590
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,064
I have to extend all the possibilities

591
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
That's one version of it I could be

592
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,184
How much nuances involved in that

593
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
A lot

594
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
Aggressive

595
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,872
It might be I'm not going to give him a

596
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Corroborating

597
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Pieces

598
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
I'm not willing to accept that as like

599
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
A full-throated everything was fake

600
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Communication

601
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
What what are the things

602
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Feel like

603
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Needs to be pointed out

604
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Is

605
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
Absolutely certain it's real

606
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,496
And I will tell you my reason for that is he is coming up with

607
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,336
More and more super villains in the story and different angles

608
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Attack for them

609
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
To be making towards

610
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
All right now it says

611
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
Alright now it's the government itself

612
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
Elements of the government

613
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
Every he's trying

614
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
To get everybody

615
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,912
Everybody involved in this which one

616
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
Is the think you can walk around

617
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
He's throwing shade at the wall.

618
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
Find out who people are going to react with the most

619
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
That's that's very likely possibility

620
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,480
So earlier he was crying

621
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
Which I think is a huge project

622
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
His part

623
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Isaiah project

624
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
Wow

625
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
Wow implying that Obama either stage this shooting or is behaving and response

626
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
Cast of the shooter the way he has to get more traffic

627
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,584
YouTube Obama

628
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Forever

629
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,104
Is exactly right now

630
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,200
Publicity

631
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
Like I don't know it's like starting some sort of fight with some famous podcast

632
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Different events

633
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
But are not true or not

634
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
In order to get music

635
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
Then of course the president would kill

636
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,864
Yeah.

637
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
That like

638
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
The only way he can really understand other people

639
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Actions reactions

640
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
To test if you had to give a speech

641
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,432
Newtown is to fake cry because he needs to

642
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
I'll bring the emotions or whatever people have

643
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:42,976
C2bit mirror humans

644
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
You wouldn't use something like this in order to get more publicity at traffic, of his videos

645
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:56,032
Manipulative or whatever is that and that's the most generous version

646
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,896
Obama kill cats reviews

647
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Which is just f***** up wow

648
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Does brain works

649
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
That's okay

650
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Matter

651
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Next clip

652
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
He says what his

653
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,008
Who's this guy

654
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,712
Mommy

655
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
Parachuting

656
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:49,536
Television

657
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,352
Program

658
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
This is the week

659
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,984
This is this is absolutely week cuz he's suggesting exactly what he

660
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
He wants to report

661
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
As his ankle

662
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Call which is that

663
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,128
Rite Aid

664
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,968
Yeah we got it I got another angle of attack for these

665
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,856
Different villain globalist to do that for whatever reason

666
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Yeah

667
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Cool

668
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
Don't say anything

669
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
You don't have to do any of this

670
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,960
Find guns with

671
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
This stuff

672
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
Wheatley superfluous

673
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
Sounds good point just getting himself in trouble because

674
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,504
Because he needs more clicks right

675
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,832
What is going to

676
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm more convinced than ever what is going to make unforced errors

677
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
So stupid

678
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
Is the trash

679
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,776
This is a tragedy

680
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
But

681
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
We have

682
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,176
We have to keep moving forward as a country I firmly believe

683
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Second Amendment is one of the most

684
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Things

685
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
We cannot allow

686
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,344
Our emotions to override our political principles

687
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,184
And while we honor and mourn the loss of life

688
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Extend condolences to

689
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
To the families

690
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
We also will not bend on our convictions or whatever

691
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,120
There is a can you imagine him

692
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
Reading those words couldn't come up

693
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,432
Freestyle de very kind

694
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,808
Dirty reading those words

695
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Hearing his voice

696
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Say those words

697
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,256
Like a divided / 4

698
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,072
You'd still be like

699
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,776
I'm just saying

700
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
He could achieve all of the

701
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,712
The political goal without doing any of the stuff that's bad

702
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
This is all bad

703
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
Gut was telling him all these things

704
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Blue

705
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
And that you're okay that's just as God

706
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,560
Unfortunately

707
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
Wow he does

708
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
Explaining the next

709
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
Whoever you trust his feelings

710
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,664
Every time

711
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,808
Houston

712
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,744
Something bad's about to happen

713
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Correction

714
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,144
Something bad

715
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
Yeah shot so far

716
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
End of 2012. Is a

717
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Condemnation of

718
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,456
It is like we know yeah

719
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
A prime example of

720
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Exactly

721
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Horrible Road

722
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
So you should not listen

723
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
Your gut is unhealthy

724
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
That

725
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
That is so

726
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
School shooting

727
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah

728
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
What is Eastlake

729
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
F***** up

730
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
What he's trying to minimize it to Ally

731
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Innocence of like

732
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,320
Everyone's demonizing mass shootings and stuff like that but more people are killed by deer every year

733
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
And it's like hey

734
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
I mean if you want to go based on numbers

735
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Fine

736
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
But if you want to extend that metaphor even further

737
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
What you should do

738
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,424
Like the analog is putting up signs in places where there's lots of cure

739
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,008
That's that's what is a government action

740
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
The tries to limit the damage

741
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
Of of deer on highways and stuff like that control laws

742
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,528
Country but we can all of Art

743
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
Brutal

744
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,904
You know what I'm saying

745
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
There aren't

746
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
He would be the one if if you was like

747
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,584
Super passionate about think it's a second amendment was about

748
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:46,496
Like he would be the one thing I like beer or free to roam you can't put up a sign here

749
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
He's doing about gun so yes

750
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:55,199
People do hiplok back t-shirt idea

751
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
I don't know

752
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
In his conception

753
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
Whatever he thinks is coming is worse than the

754
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
Yeah

755
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Take the guns and then does going

756
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Civil War

757
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah I know it's way worse than a lot of

758
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Children being murdered

759
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Nothing being done about it and

760
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
And so more and more children and murdered

761
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
The idea that he wouldn't be allowed to have assault

762
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
At the worst

763
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
April

764
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
It blasts that

765
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Then

766
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
He foresees a civil war

767
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
Coming because of the gun grabber

768
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
So

769
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,279
If you look at if you think about the loss of life that would come from an all-out Civil War

770
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,095
You could say that that might be worse than a school shooting

771
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,447
I don't think it would be a civil war would be like

772
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
Tire country

773
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
Going like a holy s*** guys you are f***

774
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
Crazy and then the 1% of the country that owns

775
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
All of our guns

776
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Would be like

777
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,223
I guess we're going out in a blaze of glory

778
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:06,623
That's their they're all living though Remember the Alamo

779
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,279
I'm saying the scale of that

780
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
What are you saying

781
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
He's worse than a school shooting not just the extract idea

782
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
I'm losing a gun

783
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
I know it's an unnecessary defense

784
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
I just don't want to be sitting here being like

785
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
All he cares about is

786
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
You gone eat it is still a

787
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Ludacris for him to eat

788
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
Like suggest that it's a likely outcome thing

789
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
But it reads what are you talkin about

790
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Isn't

791
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Just that

792
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
It isn't just his.

793
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
I'll give you that one

794
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
No course not

795
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
Yeah

796
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
But it's where he's headed

797
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Alright

798
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Going to meet him halfway

799
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
So getting harder and harder to meet him halfway

800
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Screw

801
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:02,943
So he's terrified there's a lot of bad stuff going on it's all a mess yourself

802
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,319
Do you think it's time to pray no it hasn't been time to pray

803
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,951
I just commit myself that's all I can say

804
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
I think God would be kind of pissed about it

805
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
He said he didn't like that s***

806
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,663
I just want my children so much

807
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,319
Obama statement

808
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
Democrats

809
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
I hate

810
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
Kids are killed in foreign countries

811
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
As a byproduct of our foreign policy

812
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Yeah

813
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Doesn't help here all that

814
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
But

815
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Push

816
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
That stuff

817
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
It doesn't fly

818
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,879
But it also still could be

819
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,927
Just in the use of the story

820
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
In the media app

821
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
God

822
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
This is just

823
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Little bit

824
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,887
Banana

825
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
Of course

826
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
I want

827
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,431
Talk to my wife

828
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,831
He just precedes to tell the story he says that he's not going to tell

829
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Teacher

830
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,199
As I walked around the corner and this guy tried to mug me

831
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
I had a sick feeling

832
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Becoming

833
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:47,295
So prophetic dream about that

834
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Person

835
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Infowars

836
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Employees spouse

837
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Wichita

838
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Tent

839
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
What happened

840
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Evidenced by the prophetic dream

841
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Is people rappelling into the school and shooting

842
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,007
Amazing I have not seen too many media organization

843
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,799
I've hired so many

844
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Psychics

845
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
Yeah yeah yeah

846
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,295
Innovation

847
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,647
Like that's what he's he's established I went to school for

848
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
Children

849
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,327
Perhaps the place was a psychic

850
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Statistically

851
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Actually

852
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Gut isn't psychic

853
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Dam break

854
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
I found a place in the week after

855
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Assertive

856
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,375
No paranoia paranormal taipa ideas mumbo jumbo

857
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
You are you are literally

858
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
Not right now

859
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
Psychic

860
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,943
Alex talks about how

861
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
He is a pow

862
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
How awake

863
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
He is about

864
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Globalist

865
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Trading

866
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
To be so right all the time

867
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Murderous

868
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:07,583
Unsatisfying

869
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,959
This is what my gut tells me it is

870
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
I get that

871
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
No I know if you if

872
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,735
If you include the premise my gut is never wrong

873
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
I think it is but if you're someone

874
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
It's from like a structural perspect

875
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,143
I'm trying to look at this like as if I were an entirely unbiased Observer

876
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Who is like

877
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
Bulshit talk about

878
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
Is God just throw that out there

879
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
I still I still think

880
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
Think he's catching his language

881
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
And maybe that's the more important

882
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,431
He's catching his language.

883
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
Guys this was fake the White House was involved

884
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:02,367
Silverline

885
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:08,767
Fill in the gaps in his listeners mind as opposed to overtly making the statement

886
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,815
Burtness is the point I'm far more interested

887
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Or at least I think that's

888
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
The conversation

889
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,055
That is pretty crazy lead over

890
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,847
Your

891
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,407
Overcorrecting for your unbiased

892
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
Listener

893
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,295
Because even an unbiased listener to listen to buy

894
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,903
This in succession like all of these clips in a row they be like yeah

895
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:42,559
Was anyone of the clips that you put together

896
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
100% proof

897
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
But when you got

898
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,959
6 in a row

899
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
I am over correct

900
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
If only because

901
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,103
I want to get stuff

902
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
You cover a conspiracy

903
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Theorist and someone like Alex

904
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,735
It is it is the sort of thing where you

905
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
Almost find yourself making leaps of logic

906
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
That art appropriate

907
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
By virtue of him

908
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:14,303
Presents

909
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,631
When I'm looking at this

910
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Strict

911
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,727
This means this this means best

912
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
Play the fun

913
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
Games

914
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,783
You clearly having a lot of fun

915
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,111
Really just got to say that I'm a psychic

916
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:43,487
No you don't that's fun no I know it is on yourself

917
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
I'm sorry

918
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,095
Superpowers

919
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,471
The ability to transform. I want

920
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,823
So earlier you were asking sort of the idea

921
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
Flying vet

922
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
The government

923
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
Any nightlife Clips I think he is

924
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:09,599
Heavily implying that

925
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
My gut

926
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
Tells me this

927
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,695
In this next clip from December 17th

928
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,511
He says something that if he believes

929
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,559
And he's reporting this as a thing

930
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
That he's it's actual Astoria story

931
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
If he believes this to be true

932
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
There is no way

933
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
That he cannot say

934
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
That it

935
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Who's playing

936
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,599
If those are the day

937
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,935
Okay come on

938
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
So

939
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Come on

940
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:05,151
He's saying this in preparation for the

941
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,831
Lake Preparatory stories

942
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,231
Mass shooting happened that they knew was going to happen or whatever it's like

943
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Does that one is tough to get around I'm not sure I can make a good argument for that one

944
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,079
The first instance I think of like

945
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Okay

946
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,663
You are now committing to this road

947
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,015
You're you're bringing in stuff that listeners have told you about

948
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
And you're pretending that you can

949
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Confirm

950
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,391
And they are their narratives the only serve

951
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
2

952
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,023
Some sort of a structural Integrity to your idea that it

953
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,607
Intent and action

954
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Encapsulated

955
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,215
How much more obvious

956
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
True

957
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Which is like

958
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:09,151
If you're saying it's so obvious that you're saying that it happened the way your

959
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,295
This is probably the point at which

960
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
We can make a reasonable

961
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Statement

962
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
That he believes it's

963
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,023
Yes it in some manner or another and it seems

964
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
It is that

965
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Ethan Hunt

966
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,359
Went in there instead of Adam Lanza red

967
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,407
It seems like that is where his head is

968
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
Is gut

969
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,551
Is the White House or the people in charge and running things in the White House

970
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Involved

971
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
Almost there

972
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
But this

973
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Is the departure

974
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,255
Absolutely he sang that the government hired the

975
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,791
It will only get worse

976
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
Yeah I think because

977
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
We know that he never

978
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
Steve the light

979
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Intel

980
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
And tell much much later

981
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,799
It's a lawsuit

982
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
Spiral out of control

983
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
He's afraid that they're going to take the gun

984
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Right

985
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
He's already made the

986
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
The argument he said a couple times

987
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
Martial law.

988
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Because of the sand

989
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,047
He doesn't use a lot of specifics

990
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
I just can't get

991
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,167
This thought out of my head real quick

992
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,983
We're at a week

993
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
After

994
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,079
Sandy Hook

995
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
Three days after

996
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
0 time for him

997
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
Then say that

998
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
All the left

999
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
The Republicans are just

1000
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
There to help

1001
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Did you

1002
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,375
The Patriot

1003
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
The Democrats were launched

1004
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
You're really running the ball

1005
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,031
Feel right right

1006
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
Juxtaposition

1007
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
Sing together

1008
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
And maybe this is why we

1009
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,247
We have heard 8000000 Clips in a row basic

1010
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,807
I think it was fake

1011
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
But with little different language

1012
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
And you're like

1013
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,207
We're going to give you the benefit of the doubt

1014
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,791
And it took three days

1015
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
After 1

1016
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,887
The worst mass shooting in America

1017
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
At the time

1018
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
For him to say that it's

1019
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,239
All Democrats

1020
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,919
I feel you on that

1021
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,759
I would respond

1022
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
In 2012

1023
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:59,391
I am responding to a I am in part because we're listening to

1024
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
Years later

1025
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,511
Any Stakes involved in is covering face

1026
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
But it's certainly not the same as if it was

1027
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119
Happening in real time in front of

1028
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
These episodes

1029
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,287
Podcast in 2012 the day off

1030
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
Like with alarms

1031
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,943
Yeah Alex's suggested this is fake guy right

1032
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
Much more a big deal

1033
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,111
One of the reasons I've given so many benefits of the doubt

1034
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
Because I know it's going to get

1035
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,559
And it'll be so much worse for him

1036
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,191
I'm just saying that's that's something that I cannot get out of my head that just like

1037
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
This is a lesson to learn

1038
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,055
This is a lesson to learn

1039
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Somewhat

1040
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
I think I think

1041
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
I think

1042
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
Appliance

1043
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
Is on a case-by-case basis

1044
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
Be careful

1045
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
But there is if there is a

1046
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
Overarching

1047
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
The other side

1048
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Don't care as much

1049
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Hey Matt

1050
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
I don't know I don't I don't I don't know how to

1051
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
Because all the time

1052
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,727
If it if you do that across-the-board

1053
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Paint with a broad brush

1054
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
Shove all of your procedure

1055
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Enemies

1056
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
You give yourself carb lunch

1057
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Never listen

1058
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
To anybody

1059
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Not

1060
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
The horrible person

1061
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,551
I don't think

1062
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
So much

1063
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Is good

1064
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,815
Letting blessing is often very applicable

1065
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
But if you do reverse Eliza.

1066
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
That's all I'm saying

1067
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
Let's let's let's jump back

1068
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Okay

1069
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Okay

1070
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
Is not done a lot of news

1071
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Necessarily

1072
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
DateHookup

1073
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
Speculated that

1074
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,367
One headline

1075
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Sandwiches

1076
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Bogus

1077
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
Right as we discussed

1078
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
You think

1079
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
The in response to

1080
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
Seahawks

1081
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
He brings up a headline

1082
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,727
Arkansas

1083
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,567
Already don't care

1084
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
December 14th

1085
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,271
2013

1086
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,831
AR-15

1087
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,815
Shakira

1088
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,055
Uno

1089
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:02,431
We got the newscast

1090
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,735
So we already got that

1091
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
Position between

1092
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
You the slave

1093
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,719
They should have been there should have been a bell that went off where he was like

1094
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:19,327
Parasol Arkansas Darrell goes off in your life

1095
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,399
Don't care nobody cares

1096
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,799
F****** cares about what the mayor of Paragould

1097
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Paragould

1098
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,919
Celtigar Paragould people

1099
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:40,319
I don't want them to live in Barcelona

1100
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,487
I can understand that but conversely

1101
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,471
Take on the situation of Paragould Arkansas

1102
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,823
Do you see the story about police dressed up in swat gear Patrol industry

1103
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,151
Any instantly reports on it somehow be related to the app

1104
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
Aftermath

1105
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,455
18in reality has

1106
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:13,855
Reporting in the Arkansas times reveals that Todd Stovall the Paragould police chief

1107
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,391
Announces plans

1108
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,463
Recent SWAT gear patrolling citizens of high-crime areas

1109
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,023
In a meeting on December 13th

1110
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,071
The day before Sandy Hook happen

1111
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:27,167
And that Clipper just listen to Alex Miss reports the date of the meeting is being December

1112
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
14

1113
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
Because the way he wants to tell the story

1114
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,031
Is this happened as a result of the shooter

1115
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,127
Globalist

1116
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,431
But that story doesn't the meeting happened

1117
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
Anybody else

1118
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Excuses flip

1119
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
But it is

1120
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
Stance with this dude

1121
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
That seems

1122
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Very likely

1123
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
To me to be a straight-up lie

1124
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah in order to serve the narrative

1125
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
The day before

1126
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,679
Because then that's the globalist

1127
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:04,287
Martial law

1128
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Because there

1129
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,895
You know where the globalist want to try it

1130
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,247
As they say

1131
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
So goes the Country

1132
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,367
It's a really interesting line because

1133
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
Yes if

1134
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
You could say that they

1135
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,719
Push this

1136
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,023
The day before

1137
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,095
Story

1138
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Work if

1139
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
The premise is that this

1140
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,471
Police chief's actions are motivated

1141
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
He can't have both of those

1142
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,591
Because

1143
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,383
The justification has to be

1144
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Sandy Hook

1145
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,967
Do rationalize martial law

1146
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,271
Today

1147
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,087
Siri the police chief

1148
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Townhall

1149
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,719
And does not get a positive reaction

1150
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
He doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't.

1151
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,703
Everybody hates it really wants to do this

1152
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
What did you do

1153
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Goes all the way up

1154
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
That's what he does and then comes back and he's like

1155
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,527
Even after I thought it was a good play

1156
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:22,367
But the media never dealt

1157
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,463
There was quite a bit Stovall plan

1158
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
And it's clearly

1159
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,351
It's an unnecessary move

1160
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
Pretty racist way that's the only thing they're definition of high-crime areas and stop-and-frisk

1161
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
Arkansas can you

1162
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
Traditionally that

1163
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Snapping

1164
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:51,039
Not done well not a progressive Paragould

1165
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
Coincidence

1166
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
I'm about it

1167
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,231
You know who's leading the charge against oval plan

1168
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,583
What else cause martial law it was Rita sklar

1169
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,399
The executive director of ACLU Arkansas

1170
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,935
Beside the stove

1171
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Zero understanding of cost

1172
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,495
Matutinal rates

1173
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
.

1174
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,127
ACLU Alex

1175
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:22,527
What's the 10 organization on the ground that was organizing and acting against this guy play

1176
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
To Clemente martial law in

1177
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
Paragould

1178
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:33,535
Brothers don't take her with them on tour

1179
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:45,055
There's a little bit of that and they are but then her response to

1180
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,847
You could just type out haha

1181
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,831
Call you're just twins

1182
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Story

1183
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
Alex

1184
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
In service

1185
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Building up his

1186
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
Other narrative

1187
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
You talked a bit more about on the last episode

1188
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,119
Which was the idea that he's on Prozac

1189
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
What causes this

1190
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
He brings up another headline

1191
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
And it's always

1192
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,343
Is there anything that's going to be

1193
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
Be dunked on more than any

1194
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
He says

1195
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,487
Anytime is like

1196
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,583
Knock it down that one's in my column it is the most dunkable

1197
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,143
Is the John Madden

1198
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
Have a propaganda

1199
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:50,335
This article either any only knows the headline because he's

1200
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,455
Google long way to undermine undermine the essential narrative

1201
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
Break into the article

1202
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,879
It's important to remember that he's presented the idea that the global is to trying to get everyone on Prozac

1203
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
Because it'll make a certain percentage

1204
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,815
The population kill themselves or kill others and the globalist use those killings as an excuse to carry a

1205
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
Nefarious plan

1206
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,423
He's not just a concerned citizen who thinks a certain medication

1207
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,983
He believes the evil globalist

1208
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
They're giving it to

1209
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
I am the public

1210
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
To f*** them up

1211
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,151
Melt in this article you immediately find some red flags

1212
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
This Daily Mail article

1213
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
The first is this passage

1214
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:33,343
Could be barred from being prescribed Prozac and other antidepressants

1215
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,903
Fears that they may increase the risk of suicide

1216
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,767
Using antidepressant increase suicide-related behavior in Children and adolescents

1217
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
Grab the london-based European medicine

1218
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Medicine

1219
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,447
The agency did not find any evidence of death caused by the drug

1220
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,983
So clearly

1221
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,031
The first problem is even the organization

1222
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:57,407
Lobbying to get Prozac Bandit missed that they have zero actual cases where Prozac cause someone

1223
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
Me to Hartford to wiggle out of

1224
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,087
Bicycling reclassified

1225
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,159
The bigger problem and the one he can't wiggle out of

1226
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,255
Is it that ban was being promoted and pushed by the European medicines

1227
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
Why is that a problem

1228
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,703
Because the EMA was specifically created in 1995

1229
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,287
Dammit exclusively to exist as a body within the EU

1230
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,943
Their website is Ema. Europa.eu and Wild

1231
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,479
Kate

1232
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
Because they

1233
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
Eat your body

1234
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,087
This is entirely NS

1235
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
He's literally saying the globalist want to give you Prozac to kill you and at the same time the medical arm of the EU the world

1236
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,839
Largest globalist entity is actively and Prozac

1237
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,655
In the world of this man

1238
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,447
Whims and contradiction

1239
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
This one is still pretty

1240
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Impressive

1241
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,871
Everything you saying is upside down

1242
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,479
It's well it's banana it's not

1243
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
No

1244
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Right

1245
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,319
You can just take the

1246
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,879
Medicine

1247
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
Agency

1248
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:12,927
Right

1249
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,231
Even if it's in London

1250
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
This is also free bread

1251
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
Literally called the European medicine

1252
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,775
Like it's probably part of it

1253
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,591
Yep

1254
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,151
He either didn't read the article or

1255
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Doesn't give a

1256
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
F***

1257
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
Now he doesn't give

1258
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
Well I could also see him not reading because the deadline is the sort of thing that leads

1259
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:48,767
Right so why read the article if it already delivered the perceived slam dunk

1260
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
Yeah that's true

1261
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,375
It's the equivalent of a slam-dunk where you hit the back of

1262
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
Of the ramp in the ball bounce

1263
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,983
All the way to have court but you think that you don't

1264
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,775
And so you like Flex

1265
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Underground

1266
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:05,919
Sarah Jordan in the All-Star Game clowning on somebody

1267
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,855
But

1268
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
It looks so pretty and

1269
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
Turns around before you even real talk

1270
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,047
Before you before you go to watch it go in

1271
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
Energy

1272
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,119
Misses by a mile and nobody tells him

1273
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,167
Everybody just moves on like a Deadman

1274
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
I might have done that once

1275
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
Junior High

1276
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,383
Good Apollo

1277
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Completely

1278
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:44,831
Probably be the best shooter in the history of the sport before

1279
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Start

1280
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
Playing around with those boobs

1281
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Whatever and thought I was

1282
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Not s***

1283
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,815
Is this weird line of life

1284
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,143
I think you have a responsibility to do better

1285
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,703
Like no matter what no matter what kind of place

1286
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
We're going to land

1287
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,799
Like what version of

1288
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
Sandy Hook is fake

1289
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Your father.

1290
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,151
He has a moral obligation

1291
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
And to do a better job

1292
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:13,247
Evidence

1293
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
Using

1294
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
The things

1295
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:20,159
If you just read the story it says the opposite of what he says it is

1296
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695
But he uses the headlines

1297
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
To reinforce

1298
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
Whatever terrible Road

1299
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
He's going down

1300
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
This is the app

1301
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Irresponsible

1302
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
Someone who

1303
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,215
Has something that they want to work towards

1304
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
As opposed

1305
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,263
To find out more about

1306
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Clip

1307
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Deeply in

1308
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,759
And for the first time probably AMV

1309
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
You know what this is

1310
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
4 days worth of episodes

1311
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
After Sandy Hook

1312
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,487
This is the first time that I sort of shuttered

1313
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,255
A little bit

1314
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,071
Actually it's not really about the shooting itself

1315
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,399
He's trying to make fun of Obama and his

1316
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
Response

1317
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,727
To the Journey play some of Obama's speech

1318
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
And the way he's acting

1319
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
I find

1320
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Dodie

1321
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Simply represent

1322
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
I think you'll agree with me

1323
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
I know there's not

1324
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
Apparent in America

1325
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
Who doesn't feel the same

1326
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,831
Overwhelming grief

1327
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
Should I do

1328
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,839
Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old

1329
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
Graduation

1330
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Weddings

1331
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,391
Kids are grown

1332
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
Chemotherapy

1333
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,023
The following were also teachers

1334
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:06,399
Women who devoted their lives to helping our children

1335
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:13,567
Hearts are broken today

1336
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
It's just

1337
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
Gross

1338
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
It's just

1339
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,967
Response

1340
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,159
He's just mad that they didn't grow up to pay him taxes

1341
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,951
Yeah this is Westboro Baptist

1342
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Heckling

1343
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Funeral kind of

1344
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Yeah it's

1345
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,119
This response is very very

1346
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
F******

1347
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Take an hour off

1348
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,495
Just take an hour off and let that speech be what it is

1349
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
And then movie

1350
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,799
Don't

1351
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
That's f******

1352
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Yeah

1353
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:51,967
It's pretty bad he also accuses Obama of using neuro-linguistic programming

1354
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:58,879
It's clear from his words he doesn't really understand what that is and I don't care

1355
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
I think what he thinks is

1356
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
He's talking well

1357
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,559
I think Obama is using neuro-linguistic programming

1358
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,911
Implying that he has

1359
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,935
Able to

1360
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,959
To put people into a trap

1361
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
Is using magic word

1362
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,359
He could never ever

1363
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
I don't know why you played that

1364
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Other than

1365
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Into like

1366
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,967
I suppose it's a

1367
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,991
Preemptive

1368
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,551
Defense against empathy

1369
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,647
Cuz if you were to have played that speech in its entirety even on his show

1370
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,207
There's no way that his listeners are going to

1371
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
To Heckle the same way

1372
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:40,095
Some of them on Sherwood

1373
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,655
There's no way that all of his listeners are psycho

1374
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,983
No and if they were too if you listen to that f******

1375
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,287
Speech at the very least

1376
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,335
You recognize Humanity

1377
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,151
Even if you hate everything Obama stands for

1378
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,455
Even if you think he's the worst president in history

1379
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
If you just listen to that entire speech

1380
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,551
Uninterrupted you're like

1381
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Philia

1382
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
Build up

1383
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Hey

1384
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
This

1385
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
This display of

1386
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,863
Like a real emotion at a real

1387
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
Response to

1388
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,703
Must be fake

1389
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Compared to

1390
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
Exact or something along those lines

1391
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
Probably

1392
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,687
Cuz it doesn't really matter.

1393
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
So very similar thing

1394
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
He's just trying to make the argument

1395
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
You'll get killed with cars

1396
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,111
You know like blame auto manufacturer

1397
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Some stuff like that

1398
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,159
Sometimes you do

1399
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,719
Well when there's when they do it

1400
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,559
Get killed with guns

1401
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
Your blame gun organization

1402
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,911
Like that

1403
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,727
For that is because those groups like the NRA

1404
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,263
They Lobby against

1405
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
The sort of regulations

1406
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,103
The automobile industry is subject

1407
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,895
Conversation

1408
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,687
Isn't you should blame

1409
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
For making the thing that's

1410
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
Used to hurt people

1411
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,783
These organization

1412
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Actively

1413
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
Disallow

1414
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
How to take care of

1415
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
The problems with

1416
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
Their products create

1417
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
I don't really care

1418
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,839
Is next clip Alex talks about

1419
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Morphle

1420
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
Thrill thrill Wild

1421
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,135
Tehran Iran

1422
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
Ireland or Switzerland

1423
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,831
Why would you want to go to Europe

1424
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,719
First Amendment protections no they don't

1425
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
They don't have a car

1426
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,327
Institution with a with the

1427
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Bill of Rights at all

1428
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
Escape the EU

1429
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,727
Studio in Europe

1430
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,543
I genuinely think he doesn't think Ireland is part of the EU

1431
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:33,151
Island

1432
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Nobody

1433
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
He says that he's Irish

1434
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
Generally

1435
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,319
Switzerland I guess

1436
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
I get that

1437
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Partiality

1438
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Historically

1439
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
And stuff like that

1440
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
Nazis hiding

1441
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Yeah back

1442
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,303
Wax tax laws

1443
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,583
I guess I don't know

1444
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
Pieces

1445
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,263
Him saying that they're going to release a bioweapon

1446
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
Does that all the time

1447
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,127
Education

1448
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
All this is just the same stuff

1449
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
He's now using

1450
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,551
The immediacy of this crisis

1451
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
Vicky has in front

1452
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,743
He does that all the time

1453
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,815
Not necessarily all the time but it's still in service of this

1454
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,583
Being in a meter

1455
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
Also a method

1456
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Not neuro-linguistic

1457
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
The programming necessarily

1458
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
By the way

1459
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
Lexar hacking into

1460
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Brick

1461
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,615
To make whatever argument you're trying to make

1462
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
More

1463
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Important

1464
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
More severe

1465
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,759
Then it would be heard otherwise

1466
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,343
If your I mean every every argument that he's making

1467
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,159
Usually comes down to an

1468
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,535
I suppose because everything is always

1469
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
Sure like that kind of thing is always fight or flight

1470
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
That's the dichotomy

1471
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,895
So at this point logical fallacy

1472
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,039
I'm sure there is a technical term

1473
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
Time for that but

1474
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,135
At this point

1475
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,927
This next clip

1476
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,743
And it made me have a realization that I do

1477
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
Ever had before

1478
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
Really should have

1479
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
Should have realized this early

1480
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
The realization that I had

1481
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,511
Is

1482
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
He's really cute you know like

1483
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
Revelling

1484
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:15,455
Think part of it is this the sort of spy novel that he's cast himself in but the other part is

1485
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Is he he's a nerd

1486
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
He's a f****** nerd

1487
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,575
But without any of the

1488
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,207
Yeah he's a civil war re-enactor

1489
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,767
But on the radio

1490
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:35,679
That's a good point

1491
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,263
Yeah I just

1492
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:45,407
Everything is fine I don't know why

1493
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,943
So much of his behavior

1494
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
You're so dorky

1495
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,087
But this for some reason

1496
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:58,463
Especially with

1497
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,535
He comes off posturing is so masculine is this jock

1498
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,863
Yeah

1499
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,447
Would it be cool if I was in a militia

1500
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
Like you said

1501
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640
I don't know

1502
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,344
Goes the other way

1503
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:32,000
Take a little break

1504
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
Thought about something

1505
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:38,656
At this point in the episode Alex has a guest on who I've never heard on before

1506
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,472
And has to be unfortunately very generic name

1507
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Matt Williams

1508
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:47,616
He's on to talk to Alex just about how he loves guns

1509
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,152
Classes

1510
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
And

1511
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,576
Amanda paranoia paddling about the gun grabbers

1512
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,368
Do I have you

1513
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
Interview

1514
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,672
Not really a whole ton

1515
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Fireworks going in

1516
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:10,144
In the lead-up to this episode Matt Williams was

1517
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,216
And so a lot of the conversation to Jordan and I had

1518
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:19,616
About the interview even though the interview itself quite Bland and on notable dealt with who I thought

1519
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
He was

1520
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,688
And it turns out there

1521
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,784
After we had recorded and when I started editing up the episode

1522
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600
I challenged some of my own assumptions

1523
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,904
And wanted to make sure that I was correct

1524
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
About

1525
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
The

1526
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Me thinking that I figured out who this guy was

1527
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,536
And after

1528
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,096
Giving it another once-over I

1529
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,168
I'm not confident that I know who this guy is

1530
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:47,008
So I removed all of this stuff where we talked about him

1531
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,592
Which is why I needed to give you all this little

1532
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Bumper

1533
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,200
He also because in this next clip

1534
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,016
He is always going to be talking to Matt Williams

1535
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
And that is going to say something

1536
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,600
But I think it's really great

1537
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,416
I didn't want to cut out of the episodes I think it's an import

1538
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Peace

1539
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,024
Do you know what episode

1540
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
But I had to

1541
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,632
Remove the South where I just can't stand behind it

1542
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:20,544
I guess that's that's that's the situation so anyway back to the episode

1543
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,408
Ventura

1544
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,200
You had him on and I was very

1545
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
It was fine

1546
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,600
Has no clips

1547
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,648
Is

1548
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,720
It's a tragedy Alex

1549
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
Like

1550
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
Fine as it can be

1551
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,304
But at the same time

1552
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
He is on the side of arm

1553
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
And stuff like that

1554
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,936
But it's not really

1555
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:53,568
Helpful to any of our investigative

1556
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,360
I was really into

1557
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:59,200
She came down on Alex's

1558
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,224
GE.

1559
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,504
They just gave up

1560
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Nothing

1561
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,344
Arm the teachers

1562
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
Ideas was

1563
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Take people who are

1564
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
Soldiers in foreign countries

1565
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
Brick

1566
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,608
Give them jobs at the school secretly Commandos

1567
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:23,008
Like Commando

1568
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,360
Is a plot

1569
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,344
Mirrors at least in terms of

1570
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,464
And so he tries to bring this up to

1571
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,768
At the end of this this episode

1572
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,072
Accidentally

1573
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,608
Completely destroyed

1574
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,912
The argument that having teachers be armed

1575
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
Is worth a damn

1576
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,848
Whoever wants to be in the school

1577
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,792
Miami Southridge Senior High

1578
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,704
It was back in the 80s in South Florida so it had his problems all together

1579
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,872
Why do you pronounce it Miami because of me Howard hunt

1580
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
What Alex

1581
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,504
Why is e Howard hunt a linguistic reference point

1582
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,272
For you

1583
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:43,904
Weird that is weird

1584
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,720
Have an officer in the school

1585
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,536
Yeah that makes sense we had a substation in our school

1586
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:54,400
Anecdotal evidence that your

1587
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,192
Gun loving guest

1588
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,984
Is bringing to the table

1589
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,264
It doesn't work

1590
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
So

1591
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:04,128
Alex what I think we should do

1592
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:10,784
I know

1593
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
Buffalo's

1594
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,672
And will jump in

1595
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
To the 18th and there's much less

1596
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,744
To talk about

1597
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,792
Is

1598
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
So much

1599
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,632
Defending gun

1600
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
No real

1601
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:31,520
Nothing really to speak of necessarily Italy

1602
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
About the like

1603
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,336
Is it fake is it not

1604
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
It's still

1605
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,920
His position is still pretty

1606
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
Most of the stuff in the episode is

1607
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Just not into

1608
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Nothing at all

1609
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,320
He has an interview with Larry Pratt

1610
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,112
Who's the guy who runs the

1611
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:46,880
More extreme

1612
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
NRA group

1613
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,488
Gun

1614
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:55,584
Yeah just really help

1615
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,144
Wheel of guns in the n-word don't worry about

1616
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
Sandy Hook

1617
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,288
Outside of

1618
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,080
We're afraid that people are going

1619
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
Lights out

1620
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
That's that

1621
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
There are a couple things

1622
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
And the first thing that's in Port

1623
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
The beginning of this episode

1624
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,088
We get a special report

1625
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:24,000
From Mike Adams Health Ranger

1626
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
Understand why exact

1627
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
He is on

1628
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
And he's doing his

1629
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,800
Peace

1630
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
About basically

1631
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
The idea that

1632
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,944
I hate guns don't kill people people kill people

1633
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
That sort of thing

1634
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,832
And what he's doing is he's a video of it is looking at a gun

1635
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
Trying to make it go off

1636
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:56,768
Without his own action much longer than the cliff

1637
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,584
Play but this clip should give you a sense of

1638
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
Where he's at

1639
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,656
Took to actually

1640
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Make it shoot

1641
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,728
It took a human being

1642
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,800
Making decisions

1643
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:17,248
Over that way jerking off right now

1644
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,576
The gun didn't kill anything

1645
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,648
Now I know what you're thinking maybe

1646
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
Maybe

1647
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Take our

1648
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,120
Benelli M4 tactical shotgun

1649
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,448
I'm thinking I want to make sure the cameras on your head

1650
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:40,032
Home defense

1651
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,128
What's the temperature

1652
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,344
The rights really taken over counter

1653
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
You're so funny

1654
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:08,192
God I wanted to hurt and feel so bad

1655
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,824
Blow your own foot off

1656
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:19,456
Mike Adams

1657
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
Gun doesn't fire by itself

1658
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,272
The person has to

1659
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
To do that part

1660
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,600
Example of missing

1661
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:29,696
Point of what people are complaining about when they say the guns kill people

1662
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,000
But more importantly it's just wrong

1663
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:38,656
In 2000/2001 sun god with a Remington model 700

1664
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,448
How to say accidentally

1665
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
Because you didn't even touch the

1666
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
The gun just went off and her son

1667
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
Was killed

1668
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:49,408
She decided to take legal action and it turned out she wasn't the first person to experience this

1669
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:55,552
Investigation revealed a gun

1670
01:28:55,808 --> 01:29:01,696
Sold by Remington designs where the gun could accidentally fire without the trigger being pulled

1671
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,256
They alleged that at least 100 injuries

1672
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,816
24 deaths were attributable

1673
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:10,144
Guns going off all by themselves without being touched

1674
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,448
The very thing that Mike Adams is mach

1675
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,472
India ideas

1676
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,752
In this field peas

1677
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,544
And the Remington cases

1678
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,824
Close to the only one

1679
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,224
In 2013 I was Iowa Sheriff's deputy Chris Carter suit a gun manufacturer name for Hospital

1680
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,808
Africa's pt140 Millennium Pro pistol

1681
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,880
Spontaneously discharged after it fell out of his holster

1682
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,720
In the suit it was discovered that nine different guns Torres produced

1683
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,048
Could potentially fire if they were quote bumped or dropped

1684
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,864
Or when the safety is on in the trigger is pulled

1685
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,400
That's not good

1686
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:45,472
Carmen

1687
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Onion

1688
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
Kill people

1689
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,872
End in regulation

1690
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:57,504
Not received money from the NRA

1691
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,600
Consistently voted against the idea that you're able to do gun manufacturers

1692
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,160
This problem was estimated at

1693
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
Potentially affecting approximately 900

1694
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
56000 guns in

1695
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
You ask a lot

1696
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,840
The idea that you had the safety on you pull the trigger could still shoot

1697
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:18,240
This case was settled in 2016 with Taurus offering to repair or buyback affected gun

1698
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,544
But here's where the evil aspect of this comes in

1699
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
They weren't required to recall the gun

1700
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,504
And as such they didn't have to warn people about the danger that those almost 1 billion gun posed to La B

1701
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,344
Completely responsible

1702
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,160
What what what the f***

1703
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:39,232
And the stories that brought this to light was a family

1704
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:44,352
Who's son who wasn't responsible shooter ended up shooting himself because of this

1705
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
Malfunction

1706
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
In a Taurus gun

1707
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,240
Curious about the ideas that like

1708
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,568
No one sent out any kind of

1709
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,384
You should get your Gunn

1710
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
If you have one of these guns

1711
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
Nobody

1712
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:00,992
Cod

1713
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,832
Real real

1714
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Part of the bed

1715
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
F******

1716
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,904
It's so crazy

1717
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:14,816
Part of the problem is that unlike pretty much every other product that's sold on the market there is no governmental body that can recall

1718
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,840
Call a broke-ass Gunn

1719
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:20,960
The gun lobby and people like Alex has made sure that never go in

1720
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,800
Specifically the NRA had a close relationship with Taurus

1721
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:28,640
Which explains why they presumably a gun safety organization

1722
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,200
Didn't warn their members about the danger that these

1723
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,480
Defective guns posed

1724
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,528
All this is to say that Mike Adams is a

1725
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
The f****** idiot

1726
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,624
Gun manufacturers rely on people like him to muddy the water

1727
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,952
And make sure that people think all criticisms of their actions

1728
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,328
When often criticisms Aurelius nipple is

1729
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Something like

1730
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:53,728
Your product is defective and caused me to kill my own child and you shouldn't be able to sell the product still severely defect

1731
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,544
That's not an attack on the Second Amendment at all

1732
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
This is a conversation

1733
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,408
You can't have a conversation about reasonable gun ownership

1734
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,688
Responsible gun right

1735
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:05,248
Until you have the same oversight

1736
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
Pet Supply

1737
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,296
Everything else

1738
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,320
Applied to God

1739
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:11,648
As evidenced by the Daleks would minimize

1740
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:16,512
24 people were killed by those Remington guns that were defective

1741
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,072
Yes yes 24 people were killed

1742
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,680
God dammit

1743
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:29,312
Definitively

1744
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,360
Crazy

1745
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,920
Genuinely f****** crazy

1746
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
That makes

1747
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
Evil

1748
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,832
Big literally eat

1749
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Oh my f******

1750
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,816
The NRA didn't even give a f*** if it's

1751
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,608
Members got murdered by the

1752
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,144
Or their children

1753
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,192
Specifically went out of their way

1754
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
Say f****** knew about it

1755
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,312
Know if you think you are a gun owner you think

1756
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,360
Protected by the NRA's Lobby

1757
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,152
They're actively killing

1758
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:10,272
Orleys not caring as you kill your children or yourself

1759
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:14,880
I don't care about gun safety organization

1760
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,440
When issues of gun safety like this

1761
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:19,488
Ignored

1762
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,792
That is disqualifying as

1763
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,584
Able to call yourself that

1764
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
If you are a gun safety organization

1765
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,936
Then what

1766
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
Recalling

1767
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,032
Defective gun

1768
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Because they will kill people

1769
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,872
Yeah it's not like

1770
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,664
I don't know maybe a detective toast

1771
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,688
Could kill somebody

1772
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,968
Hey could you could get Electric

1773
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:47,648
Recall

1774
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,256
Atlantis design is food not as

1775
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,072
Specifically put bullets in living things

1776
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:57,632
Unreal

1777
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,520
Because it because it's only there's only two ways to go

1778
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,312
What year the NRA you say

1779
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,616
We need to have these recall

1780
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,944
Because this reflects poorly on gun owner

1781
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,248
Directions

1782
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:18,112
Is Lobby so f****** hard you immunized

1783
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
Every gun manufacturer

1784
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,952
This level

1785
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
To this extent

1786
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,816
You can kill you can kill

1787
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Go for it

1788
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,632
Articles I was reading too.

1789
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
Specific manufacturer

1790
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,752
Company operates

1791
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
Brazil

1792
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:37,824
Bought a pack

1793
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,360
Competitor survey provided like

1794
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,176
90% of the guns that were sold

1795
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,456
Produced in Brazil

1796
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
And

1797
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,552
The Brazilian government has placed where

1798
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Law

1799
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
Have to buy Brazilian made

1800
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,720
Sole supplier

1801
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
Of the military

1802
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,280
Lisa's gone

1803
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
And nine of their models

1804
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
We're completely

1805
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,608
Defective

1806
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
Or at least potentially

1807
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:08,544
How to apply completely defense

1808
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,848
Future guns they did Market as the unsafe

1809
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,480
I did watch a video to the lawyer who is

1810
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,272
That case

1811
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Defects work

1812
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,368
Unloaded gun

1813
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
Razee

1814
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,696
Because it is like

1815
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,976
You watch him

1816
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,792
Very meticulously turn on the safety

1817
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,584
And then pull the trigger as I

1818
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:37,728
This would have fired it does the exact same thing with the AC on

1819
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,336
Well I filed my briefs

1820
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,920
One of the things that I put very specifically in

1821
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,200
The language was

1822
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,992
That this has nothing to do with sex

1823
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,552
Amendment right

1824
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,600
This is very clearly a product

1825
01:35:53,856 --> 01:36:00,000
Quality tobacco

1826
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,792
We're selling this Pinto

1827
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
We think it's a great idea we love it

1828
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:08,192
And

1829
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,728
We don't even have to tell it

1830
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
That

1831
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
Unreal brumbelow

1832
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
On

1833
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,336
Real

1834
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Messed up

1835
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,456
Wow

1836
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
Rip his hair out

1837
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,552
Become a f****** monk you didn't seem happy

1838
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,856
Yeah

1839
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
That is developed

1840
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:43,008
Not know it's the owner of this Thai restaurant apparently

1841
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,824
Since deleted Facebook post

1842
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
Failed

1843
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,504
Give a s*** about

1844
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
Do died

1845
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,856
Inasmuch as I don't care that white children

1846
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
Something along those lines

1847
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
Shity

1848
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,488
Yeah not good not great not a good response

1849
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,512
Pretty bad

1850
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
Alex despatches Jackson

1851
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:19,104
Politely harass

1852
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,920
I will give you the bad news first

1853
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:26,272
What's at the show ends before they get back with any report

1854
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:31,392
So we have no idea how that way we might find out next episode I'm not entirely sure

1855
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,416
But

1856
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,488
Alex and talking about this Thai restaurant

1857
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,024
Make this statement

1858
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,304
Any

1859
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,864
He's really angry about the racism of

1860
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
Like I don't care about his wife

1861
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
Being shot

1862
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
I meant he says

1863
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,496
Zip

1864
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Proclamation about

1865
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,312
What if I did that about other

1866
01:37:55,456 --> 01:38:01,600
When there was a shooting in Chicago

1867
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:04,160
Breakout

1868
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
20 *

1869
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,824
Throughout the 17th

1870
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,104
Alex has said

1871
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:29,504
Most of them are just killing each other has minimized

1872
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,856
Yep you listening to it I didn't cut those

1873
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,648
On my way through

1874
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:39,488
And I didn't have any easy way to go back and find all of them to prove my case

1875
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,560
And I was really worried about the idea like

1876
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,120
If I minimize these

1877
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,216
I would be in so much trouble I'd be off the air in a week

1878
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,264
I really want to demonstrate my point

1879
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,544
I can't go back and listen

1880
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,104
24-hours over again in five

1881
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,432
Luckily about 5 minutes later reason

1882
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:11,744
Minimizing and you know what he's

1883
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,608
Wow crazy

1884
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,168
A restaurant owner

1885
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:25,568
YouTube Haven that way

1886
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,592
Here's the problem

1887
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
I don't like

1888
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:33,760
With the guy who said he doesn't care of white children

1889
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:37,088
I see where he's coming from when Alex does the ship

1890
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:43,744
I'm not siding with that guy

1891
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,096
Justify a post

1892
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,656
This is this again

1893
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:57,056
The people who are so afraid of white genocide are the people who go out of their way

1894
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,640
Way to give her reasons for white genocide being a good idea

1895
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:08,576
Everybody else's f****** like that's crazy that's a terrible idea except for the people who are afraid of anywhere like

1896
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
What

1897
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,904
What you do that

1898
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,928
Like f*** you

1899
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
So

1900
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,120
Interviews pointless

1901
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
I love Don

1902
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
But

1903
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,264
Alex has another guy

1904
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Who is a member of conquer

1905
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
Interesting

1906
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:33,152
Because it always blows my mind

1907
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,944
Congress

1908
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,248
It's weird I think there's a I think

1909
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,368
We often forget that there are 465 members of Congress

1910
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:47,744
Yeah guys in the house there's a lot more of them

1911
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:56,960
I understand that

1912
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,312
I mean like house

1913
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
More

1914
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,664
Understandable and that's not

1915
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,944
The state

1916
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
Houses

1917
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,992
Interstate

1918
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:15,392
Yeah but

1919
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:18,464
Coming into it with

1920
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
Present

1921
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,280
Then maybe didn't exist

1922
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,304
Much in 2012

1923
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
Where there was

1924
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:26,144
Stigmata showing up on here

1925
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,936
No bad

1926
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,472
Feedback

1927
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,544
Congressperson

1928
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
On

1929
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
This is strange

1930
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
It is a little bit of like

1931
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,296
The ability to write Federal legislation means

1932
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,088
It seems like

1933
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
Carolinas

1934
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
Congress

1935
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,592
North Carolina

1936
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,384
The best out of North Carolina

1937
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
Hold on to that thought for a moment

1938
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:14,528
Walter B Jones is a member of the House of Representatives North Carolina

1939
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
1990

1940
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,576
352 February

1941
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,112
2019

1942
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,904
Actually about 15 days ago

1943
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,512
Remember recording

1944
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,096
His career in Congress is one that's

1945
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,888
Particularly difficult to discussion

1946
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
Very simple terms

1947
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,312
Remember of the North Carolina state house representative

1948
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,104
Where you been elected as a Democrat

1949
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:43,200
His father Walter Jones senior member of the US House

1950
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,224
419 6th

1951
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,296
56

1952
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:51,392
Walter Junior decided that he wanted to run for his father's open

1953
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,440
Running as a Democrat

1954
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,744
So we tried again in 1994

1955
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
This time running as a Republican

1956
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:01,888
Use the strong anti-clinton sentiment as a weapon against us

1957
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,216
His opponent Martin caster

1958
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:05,984
With the president

1959
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:09,056
Rode a wave of midterm Republican

1960
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,408
Opportunist

1961
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:16,480
He rode that energy table along with

1962
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,784
1994 takeover of the house that

1963
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
Republicans

1964
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,136
Run through his career as a politician

1965
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:28,768
Not giving a f*** initially a firm supporter of invading Iraq

1966
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,352
He was a member of the Liberty caucus

1967
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,936
Some claim to have libertarian values but still co-sponsored legislation

1968
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,216
The band online

1969
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:40,032
Jones was the one who in March

1970
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,896
Serious

1971
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,992
French toast in French

1972
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,576
Freedom toasted Freedom fry

1973
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:57,440
5 article in the guardian

1974
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:03,328
The name-change headlines around the world

1975
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
And it's pettiness

1976
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:12,032
Yep. Not a surprise 2005

1977
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:18,688
Foods that will never happen

1978
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:22,016
Which is the quote I wish I had done that

1979
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:28,416
Taking responsibility away from Utah

1980
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,208
I I was a vice

1981
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:34,816
It also should be noted that among the list of his top donors you'll find that he's received

1982
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,632
$53,500 from Northrop Grumman

1983
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,704
$52,500 from Lockheed Martin

1984
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
And $48,200 from the NRA

1985
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,336
The center for responsive politics list Jones

1986
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:50,688
Does the largest recipient of NRA money among North Carolina

1987
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:54,272
With the total he received including expenditures that they made on his behalf

1988
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,576
Coming in at over 56,000

1989
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:01,184
So probably shouldn't surprise anyone that has an a rating from the NRA

1990
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,512
And consistently votes against any common-sense regulations about.

1991
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:11,936
In 2007 gun registration in Washington DC and repeal the law that did exist on

1992
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:14,240
On the book

1993
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:20,128
He voted in 2009 to make All State concealed carry permits valid in every other states

1994
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,408
Which seems to run counter to

1995
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,456
Ideas

1996
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
Professed to have

1997
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
But I don't know

1998
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,296
Is that really means

1999
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,344
To do like with this guy it's just like

2000
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,368
If if

2001
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,672
Groups have donated

2002
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:36,256
$48,000 or whatever

2003
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,792
Is that really all it is

2004
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
I don't think so

2005
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:45,472
Cuz it seems like it also need to replace the other 50

2006
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
3000 buttercup

2007
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,288
From defense contractors

2008
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:52,896
Is that what it is is it just for republicans

2009
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,944
I think it's a lot of that money were to just a

2010
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,992
A lot of people's impetus

2011
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
To behave the way they do

2012
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,064
Seems like it

2013
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,832
I think

2014
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,648
Certainly not all of them but a lot of

2015
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:09,792
Walter Jones

2016
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,352
Use the Eddie Eagle gunsafe program

2017
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,888
And encouraged

2018
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,472
Funding for the program being used in schools

2019
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:23,104
Eagle gunsafe program was developed by and run entirely by the NRA

2020
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:30,016
That is a super slimey move

2021
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:33,856
Disclosing

2022
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,464
The news accepted money from and try to funnel government funds to the NRA

2023
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,280
An organization that exists almost exclusively

2024
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
The disallowed apostle

2025
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,352
Having a real conversation.

2026
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,888
This country whatever else

2027
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,936
Can say about how Alex responded to Sandy Hook

2028
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,984
These few days we've heard so far

2029
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,008
Clearly indicate

2030
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,568
His number one priority was to round the wagon

2031
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,848
A package do what

2032
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
With pro-gun propagate

2033
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Unreal

2034
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,480
F****** real

2035
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
Is there a

2036
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:05,856
Is there less

2037
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,624
Evil

2038
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,720
Is there a less evil than he could be doing is there some way we could distract them with

2039
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
Either something

2040
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,144
You helped him over the other side and be like all the wild like sneakers

2041
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,680
Take their guns away

2042
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,448
Cousins f******

2043
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Unreal

2044
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,496
This is pretty wild

2045
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
I don't want to take their guns

2046
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:26,848
Dead but

2047
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,384
Assured

2048
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,736
I'm at is at the end of the show on December 8th

2049
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
It's a call from somebody

2050
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,296
Lives in

2051
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,392
Their kids

2052
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,184
They don't go there anymore

2053
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,464
But they went to the school

2054
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,512
Play this clip

2055
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,792
Because this clip is

2056
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,584
Firmly demonstrative

2057
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,120
Alex

2058
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,400
Can't ever

2059
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
In good conscience

2060
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,704
Believe

2061
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,240
That the people at that school where at

2062
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,776
This clip

2063
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,800
Firmly prove

2064
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
But he has to

2065
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:03,456
I was very involved with the school I ran the Cub Scouts

2066
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,760

Sandy Hook Elementary I live like a mile down the street

2069
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,792
Christmas and Halloween

2070

She was actually my son

2079
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,720
After school

2080
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,256
Tutor

2081
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:51,328
Kids were having problems with like math or whatever she

2082

It was a tutor for him for like the last three years he was in Sandy Hook Elementary Phil I had conversation with her

2083
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:58,752
Twice a week

2084
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,640
Well she was

2085
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,456
To the young girl who did

2086
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,528
Seems like a teacher's assistant and she did

2087
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:17,696
When my son was having trouble with math so she would work with the kids after school for an hour hour-and-a-half

2088
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,744
You know

2089
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
Extra

2090
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
Tutoring

2091
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,072
And I'll bring them up to

2092
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:27,424
The skills they needed to

2093
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
And

2094
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,776
Really good girl very smart

2095
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:40,480
And my son loved working with her kanohi he didn't mind being there at all

2096
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
So he's exasperated

2097
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:48,160
She posted a photo of her Memorial

2098
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,720
Infowars.com

2099
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,000
For that

2100
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,280
Whose kids went to

2101
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,632
And don't go there anymore because they're they've aged out

2102
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
You talkin about

2103
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,680
Years in the past

2104
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,496
Sandy Hook Elementary School

2105
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,312
In order for Alex to Pivot is narrative

2106
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,080
Into

2107
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,872
Believing that people were Act

2108
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,688
Which we do now is

2109
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
An eventual end

2110
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
He gets to

2111
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,040
He has to them believe that they were actor

2112
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,576
Planted in that school free

2113
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
Years

2114
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,904
This guy has experience with these

2115
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,184
The people

2116
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,720
Lychee died

2117
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,024

He knows her

2120
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,936
I don't I don't I just

2121
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,728
It's important to

2122
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
It's important to

2123
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,568
Nail some of those things

2124
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,104
Kingsdown in terms of his

2125
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,896
Like how far

2126
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
It Must Fall

2127
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,712
Because that

2128
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Vacuum

2129
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
A human

2130
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
Response

2131
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,368
Vacuum

2132
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,904
That is

2133
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,696
That

2134
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,256
Children's

2135
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,280
Absolutely

2136
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,120
You know giving a respectful hearing

2137
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,144
Bring to this guy who

2138
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,424
Again

2139
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:07,520
You know Alex Jones of callers are always going to come with grain is kept

2140
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,128
Red flags

2141
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,248
A very natural speaking

2142
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,528
About his experience

2143
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,320
He doesn't strike me

2144
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,368
A lot of Alex's bulshit

2145
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
Where's Duke

2146
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,696
Accept whatever he saying

2147
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,976
It's so without

2148
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
Alex

2149
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
Sis

2150
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
This is

2151
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
The reality

2152
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,352
The reality of Freddy

2153
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,936
Whatever you wants to make on top of that tragedy

2154
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
In order to defend his gone

2155
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
And his

2156
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,800
Admittedly

2157
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:44,640
F***** up fears about a civil court

2158
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Begun

2159
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,688
Whatever the case is

2160
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,272
Here's what years

2161
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,392
The recognition that you see in that

2162
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
Clip

2163
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,184
Is what he

2164
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
Is that make sense

2165
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,048
The Weeknd

2166
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,608
He knows that this is real

2167
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
Was murdered

2168
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,216
Uno's

2169
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
That

2170
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,360
That is a

2171
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,640
Building block of

2172
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,408
His lies

2173
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,456
And that makes it so much worse

2174
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,272
And that's why

2175
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,296
You have to be fair to

2176
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,832
That's why you have to be

2177
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,856
Fairland cuz it makes

2178
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,880
So much worse

2179
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,440
The same thing

2180
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
We go we go over

2181
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:32,768
Is he like

2182
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
The lies that

2183
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,584
People tell about Alex Jones

2184
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,352
Often

2185
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
Spiritually

2186
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
But they lack certain amounts of Acura

2187
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,984
And the new ones on the accuracy

2188
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,008
We make it worse

2189
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,056
Broad

2190
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,384
Alex lied about Sandy Hook

2191
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:52,224
Yes

2192
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,248
You see

2193
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,016
The waves

2194
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,040
You lied about it

2195
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,576
Aucd Awareness Day

2196
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,624
But he had to have known he's lying about it

2197
01:52:59,392 --> 01:52:59,904
It-it's

2198
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:00,928
Just it make

2199
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
It goes for a opportunist

2200
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
Yeah

2201
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,304
It's just really

2202
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,584
Really f****** gross

2203
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,120
It's hard.

2204
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:14,496
Confronted with the reality of

2205
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
5

2206
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,312
Trafficking women

2207
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,640
You're at your every time you're just

2208
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,920
Blown Away Vape

2209
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
How

2210
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,224
Cruel and

2211
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
Stupid

2212
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,272
Was human beings

2213
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,296
Can treat other

2214
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,832
Sure you know

2215
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:32,160
And it's the same way with Alex

2216
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Send this

2217
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:33,952
Station where you just

2218
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,744
You're just looking at that guy

2219
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
How

2220
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,560
Could a human being

2221
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,328
Do that

2222
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,864
What rationalization

2223
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
Do you have to go

2224
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,680
Every single night

2225
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,960
To make it

2226
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,752
Okay for you to wake up in

2227
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,056
You know

2228
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,080
Lego

2229
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,384
It's so impossible

2230
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:55,200
Really enter the mind

2231
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,248
If somebody who is willing to

2232
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,064
Children die

2233
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,136
Well I'm willing to but

2234
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,672
Making it so more

2235
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:05,952
I think

2236
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,232
The only explanation

2237
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,072
Is that he has to

2238
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:13,376
To convince himself we have to have convinced

2239
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Stem cell

2240
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,704
0 train

2241
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,984
Get gun

2242
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,288
Which will lead to a civil war with the leech

2243
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
Way more kids

2244
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:24,640
Being killed or whatever in a greater risk to their children

2245
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:27,712
So if you frame it that isn't pasta

2246
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,480
Argument

2247
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:29,504
Or something

2248
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,296
Argument

2249
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,344
Stephen Glide

2250
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,112
Perspective

2251
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
That you could talk yourself into

2252
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,976
Another problem with that

2253
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,816
Scream this will lead to that

2254
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,632
It's an extraordinary claim

2255
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:48,192
Requires extraordinary evidence

2256
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah

2257
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:52,032
I can't imagine being able to come

2258
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:52,800
Convince yourself

2259
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:54,336
But that was the reality

2260
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Without

2261
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Reading all the

2262
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,784
When you are also somebody who only reads headlines and then reports as if you understand all

2263
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,832
And everything about all this stuff

2264
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:09,696
How do you convince yourself that a civil war is coming and that's what I'm fighting

2265
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:11,488
How do you

2266
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,768
How do you not

2267
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,072
Have like well I'm not sure about

2268
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
How do you not have

2269
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:16,864
Humility

2270
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,632
Or the

2271
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
Surprising

2272
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,448
To just be like

2273
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,984
This is what I think

2274
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,080
I might I might be way off on the most gross

2275
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,872
I think

2276
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
Hazmat

2277
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,968
We're talking about Alex Jones

2278
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:33,504
This

2279
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
Is what you would expect from

2280
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:35,808
Alex G

2281
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,464
We expect to be

2282
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,792
Not finally

2283
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,168
And this is part of what makes it so difficult now

2284
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,960
Is even in 2012

2285
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,496
Jones Buick

2286
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,312
Minimize the deaths of Chile

2287
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:01,152
You expect Alex Jones to do all of these awful things

2288
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,432
Because he's Alex

2289
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,784
That was the

2290
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,904
Every theoretically reasonable Republican

2291
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,184
Was doing.

2292
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,744
That Alex Jones

2293
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,328
Dissembling to try and protect guns in any

2294
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,680
This was not Alex Jones Alex Jones

2295
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:26,240
This was Alex Jones reflecting Maine

2296
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:30,592
Stream Republican thought ahead of the Curve

2297
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,152
There

2298
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:36,224
This is not this is not some dude out on the fringes

2299
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,552
It's part of why he have to go further

2300
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,696
We move along

2301
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,976
Is realizing life

2302
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,280
I'm not getting the same

2303
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,328
Adrenaline shot

2304
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:54,912
That I usually get from being crazy from

2305
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,752
Because everybody

2306
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,288
They're all crisis actor

2307
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,080
For whatever

2308
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:02,848
Got to be something

2309
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,152
Christine Isaac

2310
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,176
First of all

2311
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,480
This isn't

2312
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,016
A hundred percent

2313
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,552
Navigation to find out when

2314
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,088
Four actors

2315
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,136
Because I think that is

2316
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:17,440
Common misconception that that's the only negative

2317
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,720
About his coverage

2318
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,048
We've already seen a lot of

2319
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:22,816
Real negative

2320
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
An infinite amount of Mega

2321
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,680
You see

2322
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,728
On the first couple episodes

2323
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,776
Him trying to find

2324
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,544
Just putting

2325
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,360
And then finding it a little bit on Sunday

2326
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,640
But the evolution

2327
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,408
Mistaken

2328
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,176
On Monday

2329
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,968
With this

2330
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,784
He's being much more over about 6

2331
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,320
It was fake and the government did it

2332
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:50,464
He's bringing in is introducing new narratives about reporting days before about gun stuff at the

2333
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,488
Priming the pump

2334
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,328
Having these paid

2335
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,864
Gun people on

2336
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,888
In order to

2337
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,680
To help the reinforces narrative

2338
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
I think you're seeing

2339
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,240
Pivoting towards like

2340
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:08,640
Hitman

2341
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,432
Make a demarcation line

2342
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:13,760
I'm willing

2343
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,368
About when like things

2344
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,392
The wheels fell off the

2345
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,720
There was still a chance

2346
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,000
His

2347
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,048
Rank speculation

2348
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,584
On the day off

2349
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,632
Probably could have found it Center

2350
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,680
And then on Sunday he's even saying

2351
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,472
I kind of think the

2352
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:36,544
The official story is right

2353
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,080
That's right

2354
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,128
So all the way to

2355
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,944
The next day in the day

2356
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,296
See how quickly it

2357
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:50,880
But for now it's not good

2358
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,648
Disgusting

2359
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:59,584
Alright

2360
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,352
Twitterpated

2361
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:06,752
Knowledge underscore

2362
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
Were there

2363
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:08,800
Describe rape

2364
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:10,080
Review all that one

2365
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:11,616
Before the ballyhoo

2366
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,480
So far with ours

2367
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,832
Not a lot of people

2368
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,392
Is it Walter Jones

2369
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,464
Yeah I really was a

2370
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,000
North Carolina house

2371
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,536
State House member

2372
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,352
4 years in dog years

2373
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
I've got a gut like jump

2374
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:36,704
Can someone ask you not seeing what's going on in North Carolina right now

2375
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:42,336
I don't know about this in North Carolina what are you Regale me with a story

2376
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,872
North Carolina

2377
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,664
Pearson

2378
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,200
1874

2379
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:51,808
That was the first state house election where they all decided that

2380
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,624
The only way that the North Carolina State House

2381
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:57,184
Hey Dave everybody agreed to K

2382
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:01,536
So they all got together

2383
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,840
Each other

2384
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:16,128
I don't know if I'm miserable

2385
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:22,528
Executive director in Arkansas

2386
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:29,184
Should be

2387
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,768
Mirroring martial law

2388
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:36,352
She's never killed anybody

2389
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,376
Metallica

2390
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:45,568
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
