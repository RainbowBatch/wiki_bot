Have you ever been stood up

00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
The end of a relationship

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
I had

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
I used to be really bad at

11
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Keeping

12
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
A little bit but when I really focus

14
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Good at it

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
Been writing down making

16
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Just double-checking everything

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Can bacon Missouri I had a therapist

18
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,608

19
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
A date that we offer our neck

20
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Text session

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
I knew

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
When we were supposed to be

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Yeah

24
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Now

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
At this point in my life

26
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Things were real bad

27
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
I was very broke

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
I can barely afford gas

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
I was in

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Silver

31
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
I was in a particularly tight situation

32
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
The month of

33
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Last bit again

36
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
I just like

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
To get to The Choppa

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,448
Hot neutral at the very end

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Real

40
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288

00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
I stuck to it yeah I show up

42
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
No one's there

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
No one's there at the office

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
It's just completely dead

45
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Knowing

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
Furious like they went out of business

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Yeah basically

48
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368

00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648

Double-check everything all of my calendars everything I had the right time had the right day everything

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
And so I can

53
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Confront my therapist

54
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
About it

55
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
This is I have the wrong time

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
What are those

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
I look back on

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664

00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
You will not be gaslin Missouri therapist

00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
So that ended that

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Go to work

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232

00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Shut up I have therapists

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Real bummer

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Man that's

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,800
That's such a high level of responsibility to you can't be standing people up if you're a therapist

73
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
It's now it's your job to be there

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Literally your job

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Be there for people

76
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
I'm sure I have been stood up like on

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
I'm positive I have but I never really take those two personal life

78
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,280
You take other must be a reason to

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
You know that's why you needed to see that therapist in f****** dessert

80
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Have another drink

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
You could go home

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
I don't know I don't have too many memories that

83
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
But I do have a lot of memories of listening

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
To Alex Jones

85
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
He's never stood me up

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528

Last we left off

134
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Alex's doing everything

135
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
And in his power to create various

136
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,343
A ethiri surrounding the bombing whatever piece of

137
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Comes out

138
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Molding

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
To match that

140
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
As well as manipulating

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
What about those stories

142
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
To match

143
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
What are you already determine

144
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
And I think we will see

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Continuation of this

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
And actually I think there's some really interesting

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Stuff that have

148
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Evans on this episode

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
About it being my birthday acai

150
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
There is a really

151
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Yes absolutely

152
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
We start off with Alex basic

153
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Completely admitting

154
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
That he sent

155
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Stanford MBA

156
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Need to go to the

157
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
The Press

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
That he ended up disrupting

159
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Ride with us

160
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Is bombastic

161
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Questioning

162
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
War.com East Coast

163
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
Privately

164
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
Release the Kraken

165
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
Run outside Boston

166
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
It is very interesting what does he say about that relationship now he does not like to make it so

167
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,119
So that he tells me what to do because

168
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
The times the damper dondi went down to Newtown

169
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
I'm in Connecticut and harassed the victims families

170
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
The lawyers

171
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
People involved in the Sandy Hook

172
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,735
Situation was after this point after April 23rd

173
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
So if Alex has established

174
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
President hear that

175
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
He deploys the Kraken

176
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
Yeah that does seem to indicate that possibly

177
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
The behaviors

178
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
The damn batondy Illustrated

179
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Did

180
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
In in Newtown Square at the bass

181
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Of the One releasing

182
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
The Kraken yeah and Alex can't be like underling who did it and they didn't ask me about it very clearly

183
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Players like hey Alice

184
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Should we allow this man to harass people in

185
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,575
Go for it and they're only skill is yelling at people and being a dick

186
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
So the idea that the common skill

187
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,279
So Alex like a couple hours after the bombing had already decided while we're disrupting

188
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,167
Like he had no reason by that point to think this is a false flag no other we know that he

189
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Determined

190
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,079
He had no reason to think what we need is a bombastic guy who's going to yell the truth

191
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Fat people

192
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
He just knew like a there's going to be a lot of media attention here let's

193
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Infowars on

194
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
Let's get our Firebrand

195
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
Resistant to call him a gadfly

196
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Butts

197
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Let's get that guy

198
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Deadpool

199
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Yeah you should definitely stay

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
That so

201
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Alex is really bragging

202
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Think about Dan bitondo

203
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
I own this beginning of this episode and a big part of it is

204
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Because

205
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
He got on National News international news yelling infowars.com which led to a ton of

206
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Traffic he's the toast of the Town it Infowars right now

207
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
So Alex is talking about how big his head

208
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,135
And I think that this dips into a little bit of phrenology accidentally

209
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
There is a

210
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,279
Deep fascination with head size

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Sounds like

212
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,743
YouTube

213
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Accepting my head is bigger than

214
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
With razors I shave

215
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Clippers

216
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
You want to give a $500

217
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Yes

218
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Obviously I'm kind of joking that this is a phrenology related but it's absurd like it keeps going

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Alex keeps talking about relatives

220
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Understand

221
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Quite a throwaway headline there

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
So I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off

223
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
I think Jacari has the right response

224
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
I didn't come over here for this

225
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Yo

226
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,775
What's a boss

227
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Necessarily

228
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
Phrenology related right

229
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Layer of Alex has a big old bigotry know generally speaking

230
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,159
Good to have a larger head which inside world

231
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Leave YouTube for neurology

232
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,791
About Jakari white man has the biggest Hat books

233
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Have bigger heads

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Right

235
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
It's weird.

236
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
You know what he decides to have a

237
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Happytime beginning of the show

238
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
I do like his version of like

239
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
I've decided

240
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
To be nice

241
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Jhacari I'm going to belittle you to your

242
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
You have a small head

243
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
So

244
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
The birthday gift I think is that

245
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Very least

246
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
News has come out that tamerlan Tsarnaev

247
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
The older brother in the bombing

248
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Combo

249
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Yeah I was offended

250
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Infowars

251
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Dakari's head grew two sizes

252
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
That is not the that is not again

253
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Alchemy

254
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,383
I've been waiting for this bit of news

255
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,223
To break from the story from when

256
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Real life

257
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
And I'm excited that we've got into it cuz I didn't remember exact

258
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Actually you know some of the details and how Alex

259
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Responded to it

260
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
I'm so you have

261
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
News reports coming out about

262
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Tamerlan being

263
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
The fan

264
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
I've Infowars away that headline

265
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
So we'll get into it a little bit later when he acts

266
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Ashley touches on

267
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Story by

268
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
But yes my heard that in my

269
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Like we are f******

270
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Can moving along

271
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,271
So as we've talked about on a previous episode there's that whole ricin letters

272
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
Situation where the Elvis impersonator got arrested but he was being set up by a guy novan conspiracy blog

273
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
Can you summarize that for me and I will not find it absolutely

274
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
It's pretty crazy story

275
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
But Alex is still insist

276
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
But they're just shuffling around Patxi's in though

277
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
Different

278
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Target

279
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Of course

280
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
I don't I don't understand

281
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
The standard standard don't understand any of this stuff that is absolutely not what

282
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
They're not giving you the deluxe package

283
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
They're just giving you the standard one they're naughty

284
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
You don't need

285
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
No Frills

286
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,527
It's like the undercarriage and in a warm climate you just don't need

287
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
It's this is

288
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
This is a bad prediction

289
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
So I don't I don't know

290
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
I don't know what else to say

291
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
So Alex starts talking about how the man

292
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
The media

293
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
The globalist

294
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
They all want you to think that the idea that this was

295
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Is a fake bombing

296
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Yeah that good stuff yeah they want you to think that's a

297
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
The conspiracy

298
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Theory that is what it is

299
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Well

300
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
I mean literally

301
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Well here's the thing

302
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
It's not

303
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
They want you to think

304
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
And the Alex

305
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Got some reason

306
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
You shouldn't

307
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
And I think the

308
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,487
Okay just hope you don't

309
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
The New York Times And The Washington Post

310
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
New York Times

311
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Federal court

312
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,831
Because their own intelligence officer

313
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
And they said well you're going to go to jail

314
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,519
1.4 million to go back to Egypt

315
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,199
So Alex is playing pretty fast and loose with the details of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing

316
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,063
I'm here but there's just enough truth in what he saying that he would likely be able to trick anyone

317
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Who just like

318
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
I don't want to feel like believing in more interest

319
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Conversion

320
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,839
About Salam was an FBI informant who penetrated the terrorist cell that it planned to detonate a bomb at the World Trade Center

321
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
And later he would go on to

322
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Testifying the trials that would result in the

323
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Convictions of ramzi Yousef

324
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
Abdul Hakim Murad

325
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
And Wally

326
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Condamine shop

327
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Salaams recording

328
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,711
Things that were supplied to the FBI as well as recordings of his own conversations with FBI agent

329
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
And according to

330
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
The FBI did have an idea that this group

331
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Salaam head info

332
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Will traded was

333
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Planning to make a bomb and commit a bombing

334
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
What does pacific

335
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Details of it and the target were not known

336
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
Agents were apparently not in agreement about the best way to

337
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Proceed with one plan being to

338
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Supply fake

339
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Explosive powder for the Bob

340
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
So that they can arrest everyone when they attempted

341
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
You carry out the bombing I believe that's called the Wylie Coyote

342
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
That's ordering from Act

343
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
This was discussed

344
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
But the tapes

345
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Explicitly show that this was not

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
The plan that was chosen

347
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,807
Instead they wanted Salam to wear a wire and gather more information

348
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
In about the plot

349
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Some very important

350
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Contacts for what happened to the lead up

351
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
To the bombing come

352
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
2014 LA Times story

353
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,815
Which is one of the first time Salam spoke publicly about after that

354
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
20 years in hiding

355
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Quote

356
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,263
He says he's carried a good measure of guilt because shortly before the bombing of the World Trade Center he refused to wear a hidden

357
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
SPI microphone

358
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
I dropped out of the undercover work

359
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,711
You told agent wearing a wire was too risky and might bring harm to him or someone in his family

360
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
He later regretted the decision

361
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
I'm saying he could have saved the six lives lost in that attack

362
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
I could have stopped

363
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
He said but I failed

364
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,767
Salon was embedded with these terrorists I provided crucial information about them that led to their arrest

365
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
But he didn't entrap them

366
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
And his involvement in the case no way demonstrates that

367
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
This was a government plot or a false flag

368
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
There are countless complete lies that go around about salami

369
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Conspiracy communities that distort real details

370
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
In order to suit their purpose

371
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Princeton

372
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
A book called the puzzle of fascism

373
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
Claims that the FBI paid Salon $1000000 to quote build a bomb

374
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,695
But that billion dollar figure is the amount that he was given by the government for his testimony and part of his abduction

375
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Tune in to the Whitney

376
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
This Protection Program

377
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,143
Other people claim that the FBI replace the fake explosive powder Salam was using to build a bomb with real powder

378
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
According to every single piece of verifiable in

379
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Information I could buy this is just

380
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Fabricated

381
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
This is mirrored in Infowars coverage where they said

382
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
2010 article quote

383
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,479
Even Wikipedia admits that harmless powder was swapped with real bomb material

384
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,623
FBI informant about Salon became alarmed at the introduction of real explosives and recorded his conversation

385
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,231
The FBI prove it they enabled and allowed the bombing to go forward that killed 4 people

386
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
Footnote Wikipedia admits this because 5 minutes

387
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Before I wrote this

388
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Wikipedia article doesn't

389
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,519
And even if it did like I like you said anyone could easily edit the enter

390
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
It's not a good

391
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,175
Also if in Fort Worth can't even get the death toll right I'm not sure it's wise

392
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,735
To trust them on the big-picture issues like a legend

393
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Secretive plot

394
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
You know it's about focusing on the important

395
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Sure

396
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
Interesting Lee on November 9th

397
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,023
2015 Alex actually had a mod salon on his show for an interview

398
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Really

399
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,703
Weirdly given the opportunity to ask direct questions about how exactly the government orchestrated the World Trade Center bombing

400
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
You spent most of his time trying to create fear about Muslim immigrants

401
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,919
If I were to believe that this guy is a first-hand expert about false flags and he was involved in one

402
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:35,295
In the bombing at the World Trade Center wasn't actually carried up primarily by Islamic terrorists

403
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
Why would he interview him about how we shouldn't let Muslims into the US and Europe that's a really good question, strain

404
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Other than that is on

405
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
I can't believe I wasted 40 minutes listening to Alex

406
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Ask about Salam about have Obama's being secretly blackmailed by the Muslim Brotherhood instead of actually nailing down his

407
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
Conspiracy theory about the World Trade Center bomb

408
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
Because it's not true

409
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
It almost

410
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
Felt like Alex was worried that if he asked

411
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
To direct

412
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Salon Mike

413
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Contradicting

414
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
And that would be really f****** uncomfortable good worry to have if you're Alex that's a real dicey

415
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
Also Alex probably doesn't want his audience actually look into

416
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
The trials that

417
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Salam was involved

418
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,535
Because in 1995 salons actions

419
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Jeopardize the entire

420
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Tire prosecution

421
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
End of a semi related terrorist cell

422
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
He'd infiltrated and irrevd irrevocably damaged

423
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
His credibility

424
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
From a New York Times article with the headline

425
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Key Witness

426
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
In bomb plot trial admits lying about his ex

427
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Flights

428
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Quotes

429
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
The prosecution's most important Witnesses

430
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
The terrorism trial of Sheik Omar abdel-rahman

431
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,855
I am 10 others admitted yesterday that he had lied for years about his back

432
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
Posting to federal agent

433
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Some friends that he was an intelligence officer

434
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,047
In Egyptian Army when in reality he been a technical officer who never saw combat

435
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
The article goes on quotes

436
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Once he said

437
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
He even lied under oath in a criminal trial in men

438
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
Claiming he been wounded

439
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Protect president Anwar Sadat of Egypt

440
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
When he was assassinated in 90

441
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
1881

442
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
These were things that were brought up in the trial by the process

443
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:12,319
Fusion because they were so worried about how brutal cross-examination would be if they didn't diffuse lumps

444
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
Severe credibility

445
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
His pattern of lying had the

446
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
Potential to completely destroy the case

447
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Confuse such a crucial Witness

448
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Kind of

449
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Yeah

450
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
The actual facts

451
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,424
Available did not support the story Alex is telling on this episode of BattleBots

452
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,008
Salaam and I can't really find evidence that salama's ever told

453
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
This version of the story

454
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Himself

455
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,128
However even if he has I'm not sure if he wiped

456
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
To believe him unless he could prove it

457
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,064
Which is generally my policy with people who have had to admit that they've lied under oath that ones usually pretty pretty

458
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Signatory

459
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
It's a bad sign for someone

460
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Reliability

461
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
But it's also weirdly common thing on Infowars

462
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
The Habit

463
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
You have to lie under oath before you can

464
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
Go on Infowars

465
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,152
The prerequisite

466
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
Really important

467
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Mostly that Alex

468
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Had to do Don and

469
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Get into that

470
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Like that

471
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Very strange

472
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
That's super

473
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Yeah

474
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
I don't know

475
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,608
I I I don't like this story because I'm pretty sure I hate everybody involved with

476
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
I hate the terrorists

477
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
I hate the FBI

478
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
I hate this guy and I hate Alex that's

479
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
I think this guy medwell

480
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
Maybe probably

481
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
Alright I believe I will save it

482
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
Who's the interview with Alex

483
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Exes

484
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Rank

485
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Xenophobia

486
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Like

487
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Coming from him

488
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
As well

489
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,256
He heals well then he's been redeemed in my eye I don't know what happened

490
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,608
To get him to the point where he is in 2015 going on Alex's Show 2

491
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
Agitate against Muslim

492
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
But he's there

493
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
That is we

494
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Weird

495
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
So Alex gets in now

496
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Into this

497
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Last episode we saw that he sort of

498
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Towards cast

499
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
Suspicion toward Saudi Arabian right right answer

500
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Discusses

501
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,856
That Sunil tripathi

502
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:27,232
Who was the kid who had been missing for a month prior to the bombing

503
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
In a river

504
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
I haven't

505
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Made it suicide

506
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
He discusses that a little bit

507
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
And then brings up

508
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
I really messed up

509
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Which I Against

510
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Google

511
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Also which were

512
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
Muslim leaders saying the government was involved in Austin

513
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
I need bound his arms and legs

514
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
The Congress bridge

515
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
We didn't entire episode about Andrew breitbart's death and that was not a murder

516
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
It wasn't that wasn't even a suicide

517
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,120
That's just a super unhealthy man with a history of heart attacks

518
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
To love cocaine and booze

519
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Escobar unremarkable

520
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
That's right I do remember that

521
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
Only thing I remember

522
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
I was thinking about us like

523
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
I remember he's a huge alcoholic

524
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
He's got a giant nose near the end

525
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
And then Anthony cumia said

526
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,392
He liked to party exactly you like to stay up that's all I'll say about that

527
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Alright

528
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,792
The Saudi Arabian man that Alex is talking about like I said is Sunil tripathi

529
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
B Brown University

530
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,608
Student who'd been missing since March 6th

531
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
Are you dumb dumb internet sleuths

532
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
Decided to turn into a suspect in the bombing

533
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Going for no reason

534
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,824
His body was found on April 23rd and had absolutely nothing to do with the bomb

535
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
His family was

536
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,504
Deeply traumatized by the experience of having their loved one be missing and then dealing with his death all while being harassed by dum-dum internet

537
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
Absolute were convinced that he was suspicious just because of his country of origin

538
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,952
This new story that Alex is talking about it is about this Muslim active

539
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
It involves a man named Riyad hammad

540
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake

541
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
In Austin

542
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
On April 6th

543
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
2008

544
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
The details that Alex is giving like his stomach being cut open

545
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
I can't find in any official

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
But I do know what Alex's

547
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Is lying about

548
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,688
Alex said dr. Ibrahim jamali on his show on April 22nd 2000

549
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Discuss the case

550
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
And then Infowars published an article titled quote

551
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,624
Condition of Riyadh Hamad body contrary to suicide

552
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
The article discusses Grimaldi saying that Hamad had been cut down his torso and it is brain was Miss

553
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,352
Which has been reporting as being details that contradicted the police assess

554
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Just being a suicide

555
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
And then he held up a man

556
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
Dr. Ibrahim jamali was the Imam

557
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
Islamic Center of Greater Austin

558
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
Who is the one who received tomorrow the body after it was released from the medical examiner's off

559
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
Jamali said the body was in quote barbaric

560
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Condition

561
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
And described it as if quote and animal might have attached

562
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,184
You made a formal complaint to the medical examiner's office about the presentation

563
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
The body including the cuts

564
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Do the brain cavity

565
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
Torso what you said we're in adequately suits

566
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,400
The stuff about his torso being caught in all of the related complaints

567
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:51,008
The dramatic made about the shoddy they were about the shoddy job of the medical exam

568
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Not anything to do with this

569
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
From stances of homage to the brain hadn't been removed

570
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Before he got right

571
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,992
Yeah it was then removed and involved in whatever it

572
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Yes at least that's the

573
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,416
Conclusion you have to come to because I've read the autopsy report and it's pretty clear that none of that kind of trauma was present

574
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
Alex's willfully misrepresenting

575
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
I have no qualms

576
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
He has every reason to know exactly what your Molly was talking

577
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
About especially considering a kind of

578
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Turned into a big

579
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Deal locally in Austin

580
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
From an article about the circle

581
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Dances in the Austin

582
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
The chronicle

583
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Quote

584
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,432
Jabali demanded and received a meeting with the medical examiner Dalton

585
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
And Austin Police

586
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
Chief art Acevedo

587
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
Afterwards or Molly and Dominic

588
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Each told

589
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,464
The chronicle that they believed the meeting was useful and should lead to better medical examiner practices

590
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Jamali said he quote

591
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
Cannot accept the apology offered by Dominic

592
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
For any

593
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Understanding honest

594
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
Could I believe they were sending us a message

595
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
Well damn. That what

596
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
I told

597
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
The people here at the mosque

598
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,592
That they believe they do not have to respect the body

599
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,224
It's very clear from the article in from the ensuing interaction with the medical examiner and

600
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
Aveda but this was an issue that arose from

601
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
Feelings of poorly carried out more

602
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Yeah that was a disrespect

603
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
2

604
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Muslim

605
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Yeah and if you

606
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Living in

607
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,560
The United States as you do I totally get

608
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
Immediate jump to like these f****** are f******

609
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
You know but at the same time it's

610
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
It's just

611
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Probably more likely the guy was hung up

612
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Hanging out like what I understand

613
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
The medical

614
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Explanation for it was

615
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Like there's a misunderstanding

616
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,808
Our office doesn't carry out cosmetic work that's needs

617
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
To be done

618
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,208
To prepare for burial Funeral Home

619
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,792
I'm not I'm not particularly interested in that

620
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Except to say

621
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,400
That these are the complaints that Ibrahim jamali was making

622
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
And Alex is misrepresenting it as being evidence

623
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
That Riata mods body

624
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,360
Was I all tortured up and all of that

625
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Yeah I doubt Alex

626
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Is allowing Abraham on

627
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
Prevalent

628
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
Anti-muslim bias

629
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Probably not

630
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
Alex's Behavior surrounding Astoria

631
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Profoundly disc

632
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Cycle no matter how am I

633
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
God.

634
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,768
As far as actual details go police reports indicate that Hamad had duct tape on his face

635
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
And that his hands and legs were bound

636
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,168
These would leave somebody to believe that this was not a suicide but in reality that is

637
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
It's probably too high

638
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,544
If someone were definitely wanting to follow through with their attempt to killing them

639
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
And they thought it through it makes

640
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
They might try to find ways to limit their ability to chain

641
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Change their mind at the last

642
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
Last moment or limit their bodies

643
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Will reaction

644
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Toward survival

645
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:48,928
Also you have to consider that someone might want to commit suicide but not want people to think it was suicide because that's very

646
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Over their loved one

647
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,792
Someone in that kind of headspace might try to make things look like a

648
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
It's not impossible that was

649
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,192
Guadalupe be presumptuous of me to say that I can definitely say

650
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
That this was a case of suicide

651
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
I kept

652
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
Any evidence that I've been able to find

653
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
That makes me think

654
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
It was murder

655
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Yeah tall

656
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
It makes

657
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
All the evidence

658
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Is available

659
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Fit the

660
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
Add that the explanation

661
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,184
Riyad hammad was the founder of the Palestinian Children's Welfare fund

662
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,536
A charity that work to improve the lives of children working and living in refugee

663
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Palestine

664
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,680
I can find no evidence of him by talking about the government provocateur in terror is Alex's

665
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Is alleging that dozen

666
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
I have no idea where that's

667
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Brought ya

668
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
A couple of months

669
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Before his death

670
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
The FBI and IRS stop by his apartment into

671
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Took a ton of files from

672
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Him about his business

673
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Changes charity

674
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Claimed they had probable cause

675
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Investigating

676
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
Charges of wire fraud bank fraud and money-laundering

677
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Charges were never brought in the case

678
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Because he ended

679
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
So I don't really know what the reality is

680
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
Whether or not

681
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
These were legitimate suspicion

682
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,912
Just kind of secondary to the fact that this sort of raid would definitely alter a person's mental state

683
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
This is only one of a number of pieces of circle

684
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Central Avenue

685
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
You can find that make it

686
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
Really look like Hamad died by

687
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,408
In the days before his death he was dealing with that height and governments

688
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Governmental scrutiny

689
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
As well as an apparent apparently

690
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Kris and racist

691
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Harassment

692
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
As reflected in an email you sent Friend

693
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
He told of getting late night phone calls

694
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
From someone who would ask him where he

695
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Campbell was

696
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,048
An article from KXAN local Austin news said quote investigators on Thursday

697
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Said families and other sources

698
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Told them that Hamad was

699
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
This all sounds very tragic

700
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,008
In terms of what's relevant for our show though Alex

701
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Supposed to be willfully misrepresenting

702
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Details about this

703
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
In order to prop up

704
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
Which I find to be Google

705
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Yeah

706
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Maudlin

707
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
It's gross

708
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
It's very gross

709
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
That's a bummer

710
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Why do why is it okay

711
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
I wish they could I wish that

712
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,792
I don't like that whenever people politicize somebody's death

713
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
In

714
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
A f****** complete out lie

715
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
Like with Pat Tillman

716
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,728
Like he is the former football player who who f******

717
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,384
Gave up his football career to go fight in the Iraq War hated every second of what the

718
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
The government was doing and all that s***

719
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,736
And was killed in Friendly Fire and then the governor

720
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Walking covered it up

721
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
And treated him like a paragon of United

722
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Colonialist

723
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
So Alex

724
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Who is talking

725
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
He claims he has evidence

726
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Nephew

727
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
White House did something

728
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Distracted by

729
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
How good a Moody's

730
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,360
So we never find out what evidence he has about the lightning

731
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:08,096
Here I am

732
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,432
Yes

733
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,800
Most famous

734
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
Kelly radio by the way

735
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,584
The world iPhone

736
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,728
Alex Jones

737
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,568
And World gold medal

738
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Alright

739
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
I'm excited to be in a good mood today

740
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
This show is so f****** stupid

741
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,088
So bad

742
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,904
Like here's a big how do you get away with that

743
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
Rachel Maddow

744
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
No boss there's no biceps

745
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,472
That is like Vine everybody likes to have fun on the job you know whatever I'm not I'm not like hey Alex has got

746
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,288
To be serious all the time things that I

747
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
The reason I play that clip

748
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,128
Is like his information is really bad

749
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,736
You lying about like the factual serious Duffy's talk about the show

750
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
And that's the B

751
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,600
Aren't good really the show fails

752
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
On every front

753
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Yeah it's not good

754
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
The Flights of Fancy art good

755
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,584
The only times that are at their anything is actually kind of good is when Alex is

756
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Just like Uncle

757
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Play autopilot

758
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
I don't even know those are good that's it

759
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
It is nice to know that no matter what time

760
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Alex

761
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
1

762
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Cannot make a good job

763
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,944
And to ensure that this bad joke last

764
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
For forever

765
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Pretty long

766
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
So Alex

767
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
Say is cursed by knowing

768
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
He is way too smart

769
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Way too aware of everything

770
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,536
And then you talk about that a little bit in this clip

771
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
He gets down to this story about how tamerlan

772
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
And was a fan

773
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
And it's just bizarre I don't know what to say

774
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,904
Email

775
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
Okay I'll talk to him

776
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,376
They took it out of contact you are his boss

777
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
21st

778
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
Your comment about their one of the bombers being a fan of his

779
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,568
When he said

780
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Iotw

781
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,152
I was curious like a

782
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
How did

783
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
How are you taking that account

784
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,960
There is a slight chance

785
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
I find that defense f****** hilarious

786
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
In the time doing this show one of the most consistent threads of Alex's broadcasting is him bragging about our gigantic his audiences

787
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
Over the years we've heard numbers in the Millions

788
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
To the hundreds of Millions

789
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,768
He brags all the time about heads of foreign states are daily listeners

790
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,864
In March 2018 Alex sincerely said on his show that his audience was

791
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
10% of the United States

792
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
And conservatively 10% of the

793
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
The entire world population

794
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:36,384
Yeah which is absurd I thought we had one where he claimed that it was 2 billion

795
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:43,040
No I want to say that we got there with the highest I've I've heard is 10% of the world

796
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
That's that's quite a bit baby too much

797
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Something he said like interval

798
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Like video View

799
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
That could be

800
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Like that would be like all of his

801
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
Well he got

802
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
Views on one day

803
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
Everybody knows I went and checked out this BuzzFeed

804
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Story and here's the quote that

805
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,920
It's just standard anyone you talked to his familiar with my show when I go out to public half the people I meet in the

806
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
This country in another country is to say they listen to my show

807
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,320
The show is bigger than the mainstream media admits

808
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
They weren't really taking about a contact

809
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,048
He's asked about reports that tamerlan Tsarnaev was a fan of enforce

810
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
His best event is of course he was ever wanted

811
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
That's a great defense.

812
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
So Alex doesn't have to deal with any real

813
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,544
Like why was he a thing or what is it about Infowars that appeal to him

814
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
The downside of using

815
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Dodge is that you sound like a pompous

816
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,456
Dick so now Alex is getting defensive about that and claim he got taken out of

817
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
The weirdest thing is that this Buzz

818
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Sweet article

819
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Says literally nothing

820
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
Does suggest Alex's show isn't as big as he claims it is

821
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
There's enough about like

822
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,584
Diesel I already this show is that is hilarious it's a very Fair article

823
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
So Alex been rant about how the media is blaming him

824
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
For the bombing

825
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,368
Bombers

826
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
Alex Jones

827
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Mysterious

828
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
There

829
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
Right-wingers

830
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
Infowars founder

831
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,680
So it's important to point out that Alex has failed to substantiate any of these things about

832
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,544
The media saying

833
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Found any credence

834
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,736
To that and he keeps saying he's played the clips and I have not heard him play those clips

835
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
Journal but they did have front-page headlines

836
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,136
You right-wingers are going to get it and they put an arrow towards her own editorials

837
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,976
He's also even just embellishing the hell out of with David Axelrod said

838
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:41,632
So what's going on here is that Alex has completely failed with the whole they're going to blame right-wingers

839
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Narrative

840
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
That was something keep stressed super hard

841
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Based on board last nothing

842
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
And now the rest of the world has moved on

843
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:54,687
The real suspect has been captured and is more information came out notice really interested in using the bombing to demonize right

844
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,991
Right-wingers but Alex still needs that to

845
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
To be true for his victimhood narrative

846
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,111
The float and luckily reality threw him a little bit of a bone

847
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,463
On the afternoon of the 23rd it was reported the Timberlands rnfa quote taken

848
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
An interest in Infowars

849
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
I've read a bunch of articles about this

850
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
BuzzFeed Salon the Atlantic

851
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,447
An AP and I don't think it's a fair reading of these articles to say that they're blaming Alex for

852
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
For the bombing or even trying to ask

853
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Associated with them

854
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Unfairly

855
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
But I think it's a

856
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Exactly the sort of impression

857
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Alex would like to make

858
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
I also don't feel like these articles get to the

859
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
The Crux of the issue

860
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,063
In each of these articles they say that tamerlan took an interest in Infowars

861
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,415
And also mentioned he was trying to find a copy of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

862
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
But they treat these as unrelated piece

863
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Information

864
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,327
As someone who spent as much time as I have listening

865
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Infowars

866
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
I'm very confident

867
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,239
The Timberlands interested Infowars

868
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
Yeah

869
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
The grand conspiracy that Alex yells about

870
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,407
Hours a day is so derivative of the protocols of Zion

871
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
At that it shows

872
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
It becomes a natural funnel towards

873
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
Facilitator of those same ideas

874
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
The AP article about this isn't even about

875
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Timberlands

876
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
Infowars that's really just a side note

877
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Or less a trivial.

878
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,887
The article is about tamerlan shift from being a non-religious boxer and music studio

879
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Intuit error

880
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Quote

881
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
Began opposing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq

882
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:27,359
He turned to websites and literature claiming that the CIA was behind the terrorist attacks of 9/11

883
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
And at the Jews control the world

884
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,479
An important element in the story is one that perhaps

885
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
Can't really be told by regular news Outlet

886
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
Let's and honestly it might be a minor point but I consider it to be very

887
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
And that is the Alex Jones Infowars Arkham

888
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,743
Hannibal with so many different kinds of extremism

889
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
And will never ever do anything to do radicalized

890
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:54,495
If you're someone who thinks that the Jews control the world you'll hear so many things that resonate with your beliefs and Alex's rhetoric

891
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
You can tell yourself that he's smart enough

892
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
To be subtle

893
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
So the powerful Jews don't kick him off the air and that's why he's not over it

894
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Like you would like him yet

895
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
If you're someone who's inclined towards Islamic extremist

896
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Alex will provide you with all the ant

897
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Auntie American government rhetoric you look

898
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
Looking for and just for good measure really here

899
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
Constant denials of high-profile insta

900
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Terrorism

901
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
Think they're actually the government

902
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Acting itself

903
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,167
If you're a white supremacist you'll get your fill of white victimhood narratives all day long

904
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Accompanied by an insistence

905
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
But these white identity narratives aren't racist

906
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Their common sense

907
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,895
If you're up militia weirdo Alex as you covered with all the revisionist

908
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,199
American history you need to justify your beliefs

909
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
That one day you'll be forced to Noble

910
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Kill your fellow citizens

911
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
In order to bring back

912
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
The glory of the Republic

913
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:46,975
When I hear report that a person driven by extremist ideology ended up committing a horrible a

914
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,047
And they are here that they were a fan of Alex

915
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
My media responses

916
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Make sense

917
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,215
But doesn't mean that Alex is fully or even partially responsible for what they do

918
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,799
But it's foolish for us not to recognize Alex for what he is or at least

919
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
What he was

920
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
For many years

921
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
That is a radicalization

922
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Pipeline

923
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Because here's the thing

924
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,503
No matter what you enter into Infowars with

925
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Regardless of the flavor of your extremism

926
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
There will never come a time that Alex

927
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
Tells you to calm down

928
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
There won't be a time when Alex says that your ideas are crazy

929
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Because in order

930
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,279
To do that he would need to call his own idea

931
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,143
His business model relies on never moving backward toward less extreme

932
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,007
So when you have someone like tamerlan was getting into the ideas that the Jews Run the World

933
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
He's going to find Infowars

934
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335
And what he hears their is going to make

935
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
So that's really what I feel

936
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Think is important

937
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
About this

938
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
This story this

939
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Wrinkle of time

940
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
Chamberlain being a fan of Ali

941
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
It's a recognition of like

942
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Yep

943
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
That makes sense

944
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Alex

945
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
Because of the way he does is brought

946
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,047
Because of the themes in it

947
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Because

948
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
The

949
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Tradition

950
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
He's building a pond

951
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
It's

952
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
It's something

953
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
The people of all day

954
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Stripes

955
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Of bad

956
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
Ideology

957
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
And resume

958
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Yeah and I took

959
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Yeah that is

960
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
That is really interesting

961
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
To look back at

962
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
2013

963
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
One Cocker was still around

964
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,391
People didn't

965
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
Know quite what

966
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
Alex Jones was

967
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,767
Yeah a lot of people or maybe not many people do

968
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,071
Obviously some people of course did Buddy

969
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
People were like

970
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
I remember this one

971
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
And I was thinking is this more like

972
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,263
Hey this guy's a crazy conspiracy

973
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,359
Is conspiracy theorist angle is that what they're doing instead of being a

974
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,919
Anti-muslim

975
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Extreme is terror attack

976
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,527
It's this guy is actually just like any other

977
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
Weirdo conspiracy

978
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,951
But now we know obviously hit Alex Jones is an inspiration

979
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Yeah and I don't know

980
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
How much

981
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
You can really say

982
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Conscious

983
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Saint Alex's

984
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
Part but it certainly

985
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
Yeah and that's the part that I think is really particularly Dane

986
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Keep happening

987
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Any keeps refusing to exam

988
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Yeah that leads

989
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,575
Suspect that he knows what he's doing he's in denial or he's fine with

990
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Yeah that's

991
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
The situation

992
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Neither is

993
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,719
So Alex is going to get back to this topic

994
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Of course he is

995
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Because it's about him

996
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
But he also has some other little narrative

997
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
Is the pepper in and one of them is

998
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
News about Eric Holder

999
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Attorney General

1000
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
Where is

1001
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,623
USA USA USA is due process

1002
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,535
Want the babies at the mortuary

1003
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
Kermit

1004
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,983
Not the frog that the abortionist

1005
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
They brought most of charges with judges

1006
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
Is dropping most accounts against

1007
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
Associated Press

1008
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,759
A year or so

1009
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Yeah okay

1010
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,599
So first of all Eric Holder did not own

1011
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
An abortion clinic

1012
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,439
This was a right-wing talking point that was going around

1013
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
Set this. In 2013

1014
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
And Alex has been talkin it up a little bit

1015
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,375
The story that's told varies depending on how angry the teller is

1016
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Is that holder

1017
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:44,543
I heard variations of it where holder owns the clinic he runs the clinic and at the clinic he owns is one where atrocity

1018
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,567
Visa been committed

1019
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,943
This particular narrative is being trotted out at this point in time because Kermit Gosnell is on trial

1020
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
And the anti-choice right-winger trying to craft the narrative where the doj is giving him a light scent

1021
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,415
Which is naturally explained by holder owning an abortion

1022
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
Sure that all makes

1023
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Perfect

1024
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
None of it's true

1025
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,815
The reality is at holders wife is

1026
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
The co-owner

1027
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Kind of

1028
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
Of a building where one of the tenants of reproductive

1029
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
They have no connection to the clinic

1030
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
Itself they're just sort of the owners of the building

1031
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,687
I say sort of owners because holders wife is actually just a trustee

1032
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
In a Family Trust

1033
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
That holds

1034
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
The property

1035
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,087
Me and Eric are legally unable to profit from renting the property

1036
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,183
To anyone and the money accrued from the building will be transferred to her nephew and niece

1037
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Along with the building itself

1038
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,767
Because the other co-owner is

1039
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
Bear co-trustees in

1040
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
In this family tree

1041
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,167
Okay cool I want everybody on the right-wing to have their lips

1042
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
This is bulshit

1043
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:51,103
The building was to be given to these children according to a will drawn up by their father prior to his death in 2004 but

1044
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
But they can't take ownership

1045
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
Legally until they're 8

1046
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
Right so they have

1047
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,807
If this Family Trust owns this building that houses a reproductive Health Clinic

1048
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
They can't profit off of it

1049
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:06,719
It's just because like a regent until the king comes of age

1050
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
The story that

1051
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
And the

1052
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
Stuff is all getting mixed up because

1053
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
The tenant

1054
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
That one of the doctors

1055
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,495
Who was working at

1056
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Did get

1057
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
In trouble for

1058
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Medicare fraud

1059
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
Okay but

1060
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
It's being mixed up with all of the

1061
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,271
These other horror stories surrounding

1062
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,599
He kills babies at 2 years old and brought about about

1063
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
Links to the Gosnell

1064
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,463
What's trying to be all muddy.

1065
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,327
Right so answer the question of Kermit Gosnell he's not someone I would catalog as an abortion

1066
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
He's someone I would say is a murderer

1067
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
It's a fair point to say that he was someone who worked

1068
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,471
In the field of reproductive health

1069
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,287
What he actually did was not appropriate care

1070
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,383
This would be like if there was a dentist killing patients at his dental office

1071
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,943
And I will use him to argue that the entire field

1072
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Industry is evil inverter

1073
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,831
Yeah that'd be crazy that be like if somebody thought that psychologists wear

1074
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:10,207
I'm trying to sabotage his entire career so he built a religion about demonizing

1075
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,535
So gosnell's Clinic had a long track record of citation

1076
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
A various

1077
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,143
Complaints not as serious as what he would actually end up being charged with

1078
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,447
But things that should have been real red flags

1079
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:25,823
Hebron sued a number of times and ultimately in 2010 his Clinic was raided by the FBI working

1080
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
In conjunction with Pennsylvania State play

1081
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
The conditions they found were horrified

1082
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,967
Patients were subjected

1083
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
Completely unsanitary conditions

1084
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
The clinic Gosnell was in

1085
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
Employing unlicensed

1086
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Staff

1087
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:41,183
And his surgical room was described as quote resembling a bad gas station

1088
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
In bathroom

1089
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
That's not good

1090
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,047
In the course of Investigation detectives uncovered multiple cases

1091
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Gosnell killing babies after birth

1092
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:52,703
Being delivered and at least one woman whose death you appear to be responsible 24 due to

1093
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
Holy s*** that you're so f****** doctor from Hustler whatever you know about this dude

1094
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,431
In January 2011 Gosnell was charged with

1095
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,295
Is 8 counts of murder but by the time you went to trial in 2013 a ton of other charger

1096
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
But added

1097
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,135
When Alex is saying it's some of the charges have been dropped

1098
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
It's because the court felt like

1099
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,999
The evidence surrounding three of the counts of murder were not strong enough to

1100
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Pursue

1101
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,351
The question came down to whether these babies were born alive

1102
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
I need those three cases the

1103
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
The state could not

1104
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Definitively prove

1105
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
Where's they could in the other cases

1106
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,055
He weren't trying to give him a reprieve

1107
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,359
Nor did it really affect the legal position

1108
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Just a situation where they we

1109
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:39,807
You can't really prove it but we can't prove those to indict you on five counts of murder

1110
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
So obviously people are like

1111
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,671
Why not hate your

1112
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,231
Gosnell very clearly was still eligible for the Deaf

1113
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
Even with those three

1114
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Charges dropped

1115
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,119
Ultimately Cosmo made a deal where you agreed not to appeal the Court's

1116
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
Decision in exchange for not receiving the death panel

1117
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
He was sentenced to three life terms

1118
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
And will die in

1119
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,287
No one gave him an easy

1120
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
The time

1121
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
Just making s*** up in

1122
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Mirror

1123
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,199
Eric Holder and he's not even really primary

1124
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,271
Didn't attacking holder

1125
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,855
So Alex has discovered

1126
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
A person in government Becky

1127
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,719
Feels like you probably has a bond with

1128
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:23,583
Because she is out there saying that the Boston bombing was a false flag okay there's very inter

1129
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:29,471
And a New Hampshire lawmakers Boston bombing was a government

1130
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Job

1131
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,615
Lawmaker

1132
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,991
Hampshire

1133
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
Iran

1134
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:54,815
Is responsible

1135
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,895
Facebook

1136
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
Top down bottom up

1137
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,575
1 Prospect

1138
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,815
Are now terrorist attacks

1139
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Byron government

1140
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
I've been found out

1141
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,303
Chamberlain win

1142
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
This is weird this is weird

1143
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,727
So in here we have been 2013 case in early

1144
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,103
Of an elected official coming down with what I call the Infowars bug rights

1145
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
Stella Tremblay was a member of the

1146
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,199
New Hampshire house of

1147
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
But I should tell you that she was not

1148
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Furlong

1149
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,039
After this point

1150
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
She resigned in June

1151
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,183
2013 most likely due to a very considerable backlash to some of her comment

1152
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
Earned her a rebuke vote

1153
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
Former house collie

1154
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,375
The public didn't seem to have too much of a problem with her being a pretty clear Sovereign citizen

1155
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,703
And I guess everyone just got to put up with her being a very public

1156
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
According to a story about her any hopping

1157
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
Engine post six months prior to

1158
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Her comments about the boss

1159
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Boston bombing

1160
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Tumblr quotes

1161
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
Email to the other 399 State House members with a doctored video she claimed depicted President Barack Obama

1162
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,855
Thank you was not born in the United

1163
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
Okay okay

1164
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Also quote

1165
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:00,255
In February Tremblay told a legislative committee that President Woodrow Wilson

1166
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Agreed with Adolf Hitler

1167
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
Even though Wilson died before Hitler Rose to power

1168
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Okay

1169
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,935
He probably did though

1170
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,495
I mean it all honesty Woodrow Wilson

1171
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,335
Would have agreed with Hitler we're here at slightly different argument

1172
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
My praise.

1173
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,319
The story also points out the tremblay's history advisor has publicly claimed that quote the US government is under the

1174
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,391
Control of Queen Elizabeth the second alright well that one's not true

1175
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,719
I will admit that her history advisor told her that

1176
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,047
This is all just now that you know it's just good fun

1177
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,119
A little disagreement across party lines or something

1178
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
However in the aftermath of the boss

1179
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Bombings Delaware

1180
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,311
It's probably it probably wouldn't have been too big a deal if you just suggested that the event was

1181
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
The false flag

1182
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,383
Like that people kind of absorb those

1183
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,223
She has a history of saying dumb s*** so probably just be another exam

1184
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,087
The problem really seem to be that you was accusing victims of Faking in

1185
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Play went on the

1186
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951
Pete Santilli show and argued that

1187
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
If she'd had the sort of injuries

1188
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,535
She saw those pictures

1189
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Cheapies

1190
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
Remix

1191
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
These people who are there probably act

1192
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
This is what led to the real backlash

1193
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
And the calls for resume

1194
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
He's a crisis actor

1195
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
Conspiracy purse

1196
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,383
So the possibility of Alex getting her on the show and being like Jesus talking about him

1197
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,223
That doesn't bode well

1198
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
Hose

1199
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,831
Stupid he saw an example of what it was that he

1200
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:35,231
Examples of consequences for calling People crisis actors very public while she hasn't been forced to resign yet

1201
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,071
By the the larger picture here that Alex doesn't know how to deal with his in

1202
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,191
On the one hand he seems proud that this New Hampshire House member is referencing him and hurting

1203
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
Conspiracy ramblings on Facebook

1204
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
Spell simultaneously

1205
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,055
Complained about the media saint

1206
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,847
Tamerlan was a fan of Infowars

1207
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
The reality is that they're both into his work

1208
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
The terrible influence on both

1209
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,503
And I know

1210
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,039
Pretty much everybody who falls for a

1211
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,207
So I don't know it's very it's very weird to see this on the same episode he's really pissed off about people saying tamerlan

1212
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Does fan and then also being like

1213
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,071
Play this lady who's my fan who sang the same stuff

1214
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
Yeah

1215
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
Yeah oh boy

1216
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,703
I wondered about how much of this is like

1217
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,775
She wrote this on Facebook to Glenn Beck

1218
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
I wonder how much of it has to do with that

1219
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
The kids I mean

1220
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
Was she writing something to Glenn Beck that Glenn Beck this

1221
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,783
So she don't look out for Alex or Alex

1222
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Just sticking up for her for

1223
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,343
Glenn Beck

1224
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,903
I don't know I'm not entirely sure but the fact that

1225
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,463
What you wrote to Glenn Beck and Alex is covering it

1226
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
Doesn't seem

1227
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,815
It doesn't seem unrelated but

1228
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,631
Anybody who's in an elected position

1229
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
Mentions in Forza

1230
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
Probably going to

1231
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
To get

1232
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Some coverage

1233
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,103
So when I looked into this episode and I know it started listening to it on like

1234
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,711
Episode yeah Alex was talking about a limited fan of his we've got there

1235
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
I thought that that was going to

1236
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295
To be like the real main thing

1237
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
That

1238
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
I found in this episode

1239
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Who's going to be interesting

1240
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
Right and actually

1241
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
About halfway through

1242
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
Alex has another narrative

1243
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,023
That actually I think is

1244
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Barbara

1245
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,119
It has to do with a story that Alex's

1246
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Just found about

1247
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
Chamberlain

1248
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Across Russia

1249
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,743
Foundation

1250
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,559
Jamestown

1251
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,935
The board of directors of ngos previously entered one of the audiologist of US foreign policy

1252
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
Russia

1253
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:02,943
What is engaged in recruiting residence of North Congressman to work in the entrance of the United States and Georgia

1254
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Working for oil company

1255
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,351
So this is a perfect case of Alex doing the worst

1256
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,167
Job you possibly could as a news caster

1257
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,007
Here he's trying to report on a story about why the Russian

1258
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,311
Warn the United States about tamerlan Tsarnaev

1259
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,359
You can't possibly be bothered

1260
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
Specific about anything

1261
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,479
I tried to search the article is talking about but it's almost impossible

1262
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,295
Like what does it mean by Main Line Russian news

1263
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
What is that

1264
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,343
How do I look for that source

1265
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,671
The way Alex delivers his stories is intentionally designed

1266
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,743
To make it more difficult for his listeners to follow up on anything

1267
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,839
So it's important that he has a particularly dubious piece of information

1268
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,191
It's key for him to be as vague as possible so they end up hitting a ton of data

1269
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,007
I heard Alex and Eclipse a document

1270
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
Please

1271
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,615
So I knew that if I found a video for this episode I did least get a

1272
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
Brief shot of the article

1273
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
So I hunted down the video and what a shock

1274
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
Alex is completely misread this headline

1275
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,831
The way he reads it is quote tamerlan recruited

1276
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
View of the Georgetown Foundation Jamestown

1277
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,927
Us non-profit

1278
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
Very connected

1279
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Is a big Noob resent

1280
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:24,351
The actual headline of the article is quote tamerlan Tsarnaev recruited via the Georgian found

1281
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
The rest of the stuff he's reading his just disconnected bits and pieces from the article he's taking out of context because they're worth it didn't disappear

1282
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
You can see the places where the article is like

1283
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
These words do not read to the

1284
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
The. Of the

1285
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
Sentence read until the end of this highlighted

1286
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,647
Gotcha obviously there's a big difference between Georgetown foundation and George and found a

1287
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
What Georgian is a reference

1288
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
Eastern European country where is Alec

1289
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:56,863
Famous reading that is Georgetown because that's at University that plays a massive role in his

1290
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Beer SeaWorld

1291
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Carroll Quigley taught it George

1292
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
And of course quickly was on the

1293
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
It on the grand overarching

1294
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
Conspiracy

1295
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,615
In this instance I cannot see this as anything other than a

1296
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,895
Unintentional misdirection

1297
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
If it wasn't why would he

1298
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,479
What do you just say that

1299
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
The story of the Maine

1300
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
Russian press

1301
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,087
Instead of specifying a source

1302
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,903
If you wasn't intentionally lying why wouldn't he

1303
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,463
Correct himself a scene Georgetown instead of Georgia

1304
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
There's a perception he wants his audience

1305
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
What's to take in

1306
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
And that is what the globalist

1307
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
Dakota Chamberlain

1308
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
And that person

1309
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,191
What is basically impossible to create if you report to the story straight

1310
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
In reality

1311
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,543
This was a story published in izvestia

1312
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
Which is not a source Alex

1313
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
From 1917

1314
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
1991

1315
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:45,503
Izvestia was the official paper of record of the Soviet Union

1316
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
So he should probably have some

1317
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,135
Concerns about their editorial positions in process

1318
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:57,791
Just a few things Russian papers are notoriously objectivity government-controlled

1319
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,839
The Soviet Union

1320
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,911
In 2005 the paper was purchased by gazprom

1321
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,471
The energy giant that's majority-owned by the Russia

1322
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Government

1323
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
That was sold to the National Media Group into

1324
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
2008

1325
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Even so allegations

1326
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
The paper being used

1327
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,455
Disseminate Folsom formation put out by the Russian government have linked

1328
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:21,343
I'm not certain how prevalent an issue that is but I would prefer to err on the side of not discounting the story just

1329
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,391
Because it comes from what might be a dubious

1330
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,487
I bring most of this up because Alex should absolutely not trust this

1331
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,767
Paper based on who he

1332
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
They were the mouthpiece

1333
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
The Soviet Union for the better part of a

1334
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Century

1335
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,679
And even after the breakup of the Soviet Union

1336
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,519
They still employed Stalin personal political cartoonist Boris

1337
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,079
Yakimov until his death

1338
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
In 2008

1339
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,687
For some powerful dude get up

1340
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:52,831
Personal political cartoonist some good being a rich person

1341
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,903
For some context that cartoonist

1342
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,927
His first book

1343
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,463
The forward was written

1344
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
B raps

1345
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:05,631
See nothing this is what I'm saying this is the dude right here I wasn't able to find this axe

1346
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
Will article

1347
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:10,495
But I did find an article in The Interpreter covering the underlying article

1348
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,103
Apparently izvestia was alleging that they receive documents from the Georgian inn

1349
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
Interior minister

1350
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
Reclaiming the D Caucasian fun

1351
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,967
Was in League with the Jamestown Foundation

1352
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,783
And they were recruiting residents to advance us interest in

1353
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
In the country of Georgia

1354
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
Basically attack

1355
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Can Russia

1356
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,719
The claim that these foundations were actually doing this has not been proven

1357
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,511
And on top of that the additives

1358
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,303
Situation that tamerlan attended one of the

1359
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
The meeting they held to recruit

1360
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
People is based on no information

1361
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
I'm past the fact

1362
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,935
Tamerlan was in the region

1363
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
At that time

1364
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,799
Even Artis eventual coverage of this story says quote

1365
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:49,919
Georgia's Ministry of internal affairs said it had no knowledge of whether Tsarnaev had attended the seminar

1366
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:55,039
Quote we don't have such information we haven't heard anything of the kind we don't know

1367
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
Nino giorgianni

1368
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,671
Head of the Georgian Ministry of internal affairs press service told Rai

1369
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
Novosti

1370
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,815
Both Russian State media is like Infowars but sometimes they issue

1371
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,375
She Corrections like

1372
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,215
Coverage underwire

1373
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,567
An issue that needs to be pointed out here is the Russian state would have a very vested in

1374
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,383
Justin trying to disrupt Western relations with Georgia

1375
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
At this point in time

1376
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,759
There was a process in motion for Georgia to join NATO which would have made it

1377
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
The farthest

1378
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
East Country due south

1379
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,367
The time which Russia would naturally see as a threat

1380
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
An incursion

1381
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:37,023
Accusing the west of recruiting people to attack Georgia attack Russia from Georgia one of whom

1382
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
Ends up becoming a domestic terrorist in the United

1383
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,911
Seems like a good method to so some trouble in the NATO accession

1384
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Yeah that would

1385
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:49,055
That's just kind of speculation on my part and I can't really stand behind that is being what's up here

1386
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,359
All I can say is that evidence offered is

1387
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,271
And I'm generally pretty skeptical of vague information that comes out of Russia about these sorts of regional issues

1388
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Involving

1389
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
States that are leaning towards

1390
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,647
I think that you need to really

1391
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,463
Nail down specifics if you got a

1392
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Traffic in that

1393
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,815
But even leaving all of that aside

1394
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,863
The story that Alex is telling doesn't like

1395
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,911
This report

1396
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
From the Georgian Ministry

1397
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,751
Into your interior Ministry allegedly

1398
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,103
It's claiming that tamerlan was recruited in the summer of 2012

1399
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
And that's why the Alex

1400
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,199
This is why the Russian government

1401
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
Warn the United States about him

1402
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,295
Well that's when you would that was the summer of Rage

1403
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
So

1404
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,111
I wish I would recruit a lot of people

1405
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,975
Unfortunately Russia War the United States about tamerlan in early 2011

1406
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,511
Well before this alleged

1407
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
Recruitment meeting discussed

1408
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Denny's Vestal

1409
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
Therefore Alex's narrative

1410
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Cannot be true

1411
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,447
It literate based on this

1412
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
A piece of information that he's bringing

1413
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,311
Table this is why the Russian government warrant yet

1414
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
Can't be true timeline doesn't work

1415
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
That sucks

1416
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Alex's just found it

1417
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:02,015
Stan shaded report out of the Russian media that contains enough buzzwords

1418
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,599
How to connect tamburlin with Georgetown and zbigniew Brzezinski

1419
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
So he's running with

1420
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,159
Is a sloppy work

1421
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
And It ultimately mean

1422
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Have

1423
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Georgian

1424
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,327
Georgetown and you just

1425
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:20,447
Just don't do anything about it like either you can't read or you're just a flat-out liar

1426
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:25,823
And that both of those are really bad later in the episode you read the headline Lee does read

1427
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
It correctly but he's back in

1428
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,175
Okay alternates a little bit

1429
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,247
Kind of leads you to believe that it's

1430
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,039
Just bad reading yeah

1431
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,111
But the worry really brilliant blurring of the lines

1432
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,927
While still giving yourself some space to be like

1433
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
Don't know I said it correctly

1434
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
It's hard just misspoke the other toy

1435
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,071
It's hard to say exactly but at the

1436
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
The same time

1437
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
The Narrative that he's putting forth

1438
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:50,911
More closely

1439
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,983
I'm thinking it's Georgetown then Georgia

1440
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,287
Yeah so I choose

1441
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,591
Chooses top I mean

1442
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
Inclined to believe

1443
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
That its intention

1444
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,199
But I'm not tired

1445
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,527
So in the next clip Alex their claims

1446
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
The he spoken

1447
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,575
Tamerlan's family

1448
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
And I don't believe this is

1449
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,959
We confirm that I talk to her

1450
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,591
I called her back and she's crying she does Abel trust me like a bug is there listening I can't talk

1451
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,639
I love my family

1452
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,943
America

1453
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,271
I thought it was free terrible

1454
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,295
Obviously

1455
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,951
Catch

1456
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
And by the way

1457
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655
I don't believe this for a couple reasons

1458
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
Because it's Alex

1459
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,215
Mostly

1460
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,287
The other thing is like hey

1461
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
Who's Drew

1462
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,383
You probably just put her

1463
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
It's serious Danger

1464
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,711
That's one of the reasons I don't believe that it's

1465
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,527
Because I think even Alex would recognize

1466
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,319
I might get this woman killed

1467
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,111
If I am talking like this on air

1468
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
Yeah and I I just don't I don't believe any of

1469
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
I don't

1470
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
I just don't

1471
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Whatever

1472
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,327
There's such a weird line that Alex has

1473
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Between like

1474
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
What he'll repeat and what

1475
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,727
Pretends he's like that's off the record I must keep that sacred

1476
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,847
Like I can't imagine the reveal that Donald Trump jr.

1477
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Yeah

1478
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,687
I don't know I don't listen to this

1479
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Just don't

1480
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
The most

1481
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,783
I will give him

1482
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Is

1483
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
In in my head here's how this plays out

1484
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
He gives her a call and she

1485
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,927
She's like sure I'll give you a name

1486
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,511
And he's like okay I'll call back that falls through with more information

1487
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
And then she does a cursory Google search

1488
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Infowars

1489
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
I am not going to be giving you an a

1490
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,239
Or because you're f****** lying piece of s*** or even just a ball drop

1491
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
Even know

1492
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Decision is made

1493
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
You like that it never

1494
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,919
Yeah too busy talking to other sources or whatever

1495
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,551
Definitely not the government calling and threatening that there's also decent chance that Alex just saw some

1496
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
Some comments the family had made

1497
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
In other media sources

1498
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:24,255
And realizes there's no downside to me just making stuff up

1499
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,559
I think it's entirely possible that it's just

1500
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Hulk

1501
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
That's possible

1502
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,191
So is talking about how to do scientific

1503
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
In the world is

1504
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:39,359
Globus plan as we know he just saw Oblivion

1505
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,663
Blown really really f***** him up on

1506
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,247
So that is part of what he's talking about that's all the globalist

1507
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,063
Name drops another movie in this

1508
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
Is there a mic while that's in play

1509
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,207
That's crazy he wrote Moonraker in the fifties

1510
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Ian Fleming

1511
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,023
Moonrakers the play

1512
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,911
Garden garden

1513
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
Zardoz

1514
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,463
I'm not going to be able to get the image of Alex Jones wearing that costume out of

1515
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:31,327
The grossest thing are gross

1516
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,679
So the this comes after like a really long stretch of him

1517
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
I'm doing a call back

1518
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,799
Depression and yelping about Cobra Commander

1519
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
He's yelling about how like they're like the globalist

1520
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:48,735
Are Cobra is the media's going to take this and say that I believe in g.i. Joe

1521
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
No it's all the same

1522
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
The media's going to take this

1523
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
Play I Believe In g.i. Joe which is f****** crazy

1524
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,695
I don't even start of idiots

1525
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
It's at its very unhinged

1526
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,583
He's just filling time and he knows that's one of the only.

1527
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
Impressions

1528
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,215
A lot

1529
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
Guzzardo's Bobby does not

1530
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Abu

1531
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,079
So he's got this story from izvestia

1532
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
This

1533
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,407
Story about

1534
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
This alleged

1535
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,735
Recruitment thing

1536
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
The Chamberlain

1537
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,087
Was in the region at the same time as so therefore Alex

1538
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Decided he did go to this

1539
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,743
It's interesting because the next time he brings it up on the episode

1540
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,791
He's completely changed the story

1541
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,071
Even from

1542
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,119
The beginning of how he was president

1543
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:44,031
Story up on infowars.com is that the CIA

1544
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,711
The older

1545
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,551
1 Brothers

1546
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
The older Timberland brother

1547
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
So Alex has now changed

1548
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
The story to the CIA recruited

1549
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
So we have

1550
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,279
The Jamestown Foundation

1551
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
And the Georgian fund

1552
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,143
In the article real legitly

1553
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,703
Alex's change that to

1554
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:18,079
But he's already pivoted because he knows

1555
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,919
He's made it vague enough that nobody's going to be able to find his underlying story

1556
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,503
And so they're just going to take his word on it cuz he's a f******

1557
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,527
But you knows everything

1558
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:30,879
So now I'm supposed to believe that the big new Brzezinski is working with the CIA

1559
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,695
The thing is

1560
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,535
You could believe that when he was a secretary of state

1561
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
The thing is the big represents key isn't

1562
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
Even really reference

1563
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,703
In the article itself it's just

1564
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,519
Did the Jamestown Foundation used to be on the board of

1565
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
Right formula

1566
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
Right so

1567
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
Yeah whatever

1568
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,895
Alex is just

1569
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,199
Created this as a new wrinkle

1570
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
That he's adding on to the story

1571
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
He has no reason to report

1572
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
What an ass

1573
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
Write the stories

1574
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
Enough on its own

1575
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
But now you add this is just

1576
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,535
Now you're just creating a fiction who isn't involved

1577
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,375
Everyone involved

1578
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
College Foundation

1579
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,495
Zbigniew Brzezinski this all the way to the middle.

1580
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
So it look dude

1581
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
Obviously

1582
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
You could have your

1583
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
If you have

1584
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Your position

1585
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
Different than Alex

1586
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Because you're dumb

1587
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,807
And that is because Alex is backed up by season

1588
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,087
Expert Auto Electric

1589
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,927
Black Ops

1590
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:05,599
Yes call me

1591
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
They call me

1592
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:15,839
Those are all qualities you associate with

1593
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,399
I do love that like they call me spooky

1594
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
Who's the second

1595
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,519
Time the spookies come up I don't know it must have been some headline

1596
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:29,919
About it must be some story I don't know what to say some local Austin paper and

1597
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Alex Jones

1598
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,271
Is it ghost

1599
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
Alex's

1600
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:44,255
Steve pieczenik agree with them

1601
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,583
I will say I am very willing to disagree without so

1602
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,423
That is not changed my perspective you know they are seasoned to taste

1603
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,239
They are not necessarily seasoned well

1604
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,055
Took Alex doesn't have either of them on the show

1605
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,615
On the 24th but he does have dampened

1606
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,711
This is one of the satyr interviews I've ever heard in my life

1607
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
Because we learned some things

1608
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,319
About what's happening in Danville.

1609
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,879
These life hasn't all Ono

1610
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,159
Happened within

1611
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Infowars

1612
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
My friend

1613
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,511
So he has batondy on and it comes up a couple times

1614
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
His life is falling

1615
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
The part

1616
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:55,167
Yes family members who don't want to deal with him because of this

1617
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:01,567
Behavior right he said that his girlfriend doesn't like the fat his girlfriend's family doesn't allow him

1618
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,383
Him at their house anymore that's good call

1619
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,431
Look at these are natural,

1620
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,455
It's going to reserve

1621
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,527
Like bringing this kind of negative attend

1622
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
It's your life

1623
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,927
You see this and you hear Alex basically like they just they're just cowards

1624
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
Write this is

1625
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,487
Same isolation

1626
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,279
They can see him doing with his collar

1627
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,303
We start with the

1628
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
14 year old boy

1629
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,911
The last episode you see this like

1630
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,007
Hey Alex all this negative stuff is happening because I believe

1631
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,567
IQ and I'm taking the appropriate action

1632
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
Based on what you say

1633
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,175
I feel like these are negatives

1634
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
No the positive all those people are weak

1635
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,039
They just don't know the truth they can't

1636
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:48,415
Can't handle it they should be giving you a parade f****** cowards the only truth is here

1637
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
There's a f****** Colts

1638
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Yeah that's

1639
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:54,303
That's really terrible because his example is

1640
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,887
Is you believe all of this s*** and then you make millions of dollars lying

1641
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
Like

1642
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,263
Of course he's not going to say anything other than

1643
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,103
This is the greatest works for me it works perfectly for me

1644
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
0 consequences

1645
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:14,015
Yeah only imagined one people saying that I'm

1646
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,599
Tied to the bomber I'm able to turn into positive driver

1647
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,791
It's a real bummer because like I f****** hate damp adande but it's same time even if you have this villain

1648
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Guy

1649
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,167
Do you can still clearly see the manipulation that Alex is doing

1650
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
To him

1651
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,983
And when he comes on Outdoor Show and talks about

1652
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Personal

1653
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
Consequences that he's

1654
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
Having

1655
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,383
Can't help

1656
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
But feel a little bit for it

1657
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,759
At the same time I think more of my empathy goes to like his

1658
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,295
Or his family

1659
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
Who has to make that difficult decision

1660
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Looks like hey

1661
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,671
We have a boundary and you crossed it

1662
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Right

1663
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
I just

1664
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,279
The human aspect of this is always very difficult

1665
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,559
When it's when

1666
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
When it comes up

1667
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:04,191
So I'm not going to play too much damn batondy his girlfriend

1668
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,727
Family is super stoked

1669
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,007
That they have to

1670
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
Keep her

1671
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,823
Boyfriend out of their house

1672
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,687
Like that's any of the former pro wrestling a real bummer of just being like

1673
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Okay

1674
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,503
It's Dynamic you never really want to

1675
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
To have like you're dating

1676
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
Somebody in your family doesn't get along with them

1677
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,879
City yeah

1678
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,695
Because he's an Infowars reporter who disrupt

1679
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,743
Boston bombing press conference

1680
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:31,327
It takes on an elevated level of like hay

1681
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,631
That's that's not the look who's coming

1682
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:40,031
To dinner but he does do some

1683
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
That I

1684
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
To pay attention

1685
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
2

1686
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Oh no Thomas Jeff

1687
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
Tell me about my day

1688
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:08,447
George Washington all right that's a real famous quote that it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees

1689
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,263
From George Washington it's a real rally and cry

1690
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:17,152
I meant to give that you feel like you should give your life rather than submit appearance at George Washington 100%

1691
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,456
George Washington

1692
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:25,088
The best thing that Alex Arredondo could do to make this American in origin is to say that it's an fpr

1693
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,440
Since he did say it on in a June 19th 1941 speech

1694
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,488
Quote we to Born to

1695
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,048
The freedom and believing in Freedom are willing to fight to me

1696
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Maintain freedom

1697
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:39,936
We and all others who believe as deeply as we do would rather die on our feet than live on our knees

1698
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
However

1699
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,776
Fpr was actually making the reference

1700
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,312
The source of the original quote

1701
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:49,152
Which is probably why you said we and all others who believe is deeply as we do

1702
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,016
The original source of this quote is Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata

1703
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,320
Alex does not like Zapata

1704
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,880
Mostly because he was involved in peasant revolt

1705
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
And carried out directax

1706
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,696
Turn towards land reform

1707
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,024
It's such a bizarre phenomenon among these right-wing idiot

1708
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:09,888
They fetishizing lionize the founding fathers of our country and yet so much they think

1709
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,912
They know about them is

1710
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Fruit

1711
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
They imagine what their political

1712
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
Positions really word attributed all sorts of

1713
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,056
Wheelie Falls quotes

1714
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,896
But the trend that I'm starting to see looks a little more Sinister than it is

1715
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
These people are robbing non-white communities of their history

1716
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,832
Alex has repeatedly tried to pass off a Frederick Douglass quote is being a

1717
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
Thomas Jefferson quote

1718
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,904
Adhered a downed he's taking his

1719
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,208
Zapata quote and attributing it to Washington

1720
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
They love the words but they want a white person

1721
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
To be saying

1722
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,632
And I'm not saying that Alex arbit on do you consciously even doing that

1723
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,520
I think it's entirely possible that they just get all their information from places where the prevailing thought leaders

1724
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Or whitewash

1725
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
Don't people like Alexandra.

1726
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,896
They have no idea they're parroting back

1727
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,456
Completely incoherent in Falls version of History

1728
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,736
Did they claim to love some

1729
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
It's most likely

1730
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,088
Yeah I mean there's an ecosystem to probably Reaper

1731
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
Purposes

1732
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,136
Really great

1733
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Appreciate

1734
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,952
That are part of

1735
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
Non-white

1736
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:13,120
Community's history puts them on people like Thomas Jefferson and so many of them are quotes

1737
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
About defeating

1738
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
The very tyranny that they themselves represent

1739
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
You know like Zapata isn't

1740
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
Isn't saying that

1741
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,408
Because he wants a whatever-it-is government Alex Jones

1742
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,736
No most always the polar up

1743
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,064
So they take the people who are on the right side of History

1744
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:38,464
Turn them white and use it for the wrong scientist like a Frederick Douglass specifically about the Confederacy and

1745
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
Slavery

1746
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:44,352
And Alex attributes that to Thomas Jefferson to do Alex's

1747
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:49,216
Family members who were alive back then specifically fought against Frederick Douglass

1748
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,264
It's just it's

1749
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,824
It's nonsensical but it makes

1750
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,128
Total sense all of the good parts

1751
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Of American history

1752
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
Are actually done

1753
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,224
Buy wipes

1754
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,784
People who oppressed reason that does

1755
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,368
So in his next Club Alex.

1756
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Is a gas that's

1757
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
There's actually a little bit of drama

1758
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,328
And it's an email.

1759
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,888
He says

1760
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Friend

1761
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,056
Show that is coming up

1762
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,128
So I don't know if you actually Alex even gets to that thing

1763
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
Sing from the Elijah

1764
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,944
Cop I don't know if he does

1765
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,992
If he does it's very

1766
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
Subtly worked in

1767
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
And I didn't notice it

1768
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,344
Lindsey Williams

1769
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,648
If you ever call Lindsey Williams

1770
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,672
Who's the guy who claims

1771
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
He was a chap

1772
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
On an oil derrick

1773
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,512
Or something like that

1774
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,048
Through that ended up meeting

1775
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:52,448
Elite globalist we ended up living with for a few years ago secret information

1776
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
That ends up not being

1777
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,264
So he's running that

1778
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,872
Scam he's he's got that Forrest Gump thing going but he's he's adding a little Chaplin

1779
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,712
Intuit so he's coming up later on the show which I was like that's not

1780
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Cuz Alex is audien

1781
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,368
I don't know exactly the timeline of it but if I understand correctly by this

1782
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,160
They've largely turned it

1783
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,072
Because he is so clearly a shell not for like the government but he's just trying to he's running a hoe

1784
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Even Alex is audience

1785
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,704
The see-through guy story makes no sense

1786
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
These predictions are s***

1787
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,032
You just trying to sell s***

1788
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,336
Like I've seen it on Alex's message

1789
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
Baseboards like a real

1790
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,640
Anti Lindsey Williams

1791
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
Yeah sounds like

1792
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
So he's coming later

1793
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,296
Alex Goes to call

1794
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
One of these callers

1795
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
Hissing Oblivion

1796
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,096
Okay alright look f****** dumb laser focus now let's do that I'll excuse

1797
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:55,936
Still deeply obsessed

1798
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,264
So I want to rewrite this movie through what these idiots say about

1799
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,456
Was an amazing film have to say

1800
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,880
Pro-mail

1801
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,888
I mean

1802
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,776
It's something you don't see anymore

1803
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
It's about clones

1804
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,616
About water

1805
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,712
Yeah they just like heaven session

1806
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,296
Two dudes really love the movie

1807
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:47,136
And then Alex of course he has to brag about how his magazine

1808
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,720
Have the bad guy and I've only playing this

1809
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Here the giddiness

1810
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
And Alex's voice listen to it

1811
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,824
What

1812
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,152
Czi attend

1813
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,440
He's so excited

1814
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,512
And again I have to stress the cover of his magazine

1815
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:28,096
Lead was just a Photoshop of Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey

1816
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Luciana.

1817
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,400
This is

1818
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,704
He doesn't get as much credit as he thinks he does

1819
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:39,616
There has to be something that could have been like there's got to be somewhere along his life where you could have had

1820
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
This

1821
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
Very childlike

1822
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,712
Glee it seems something

1823
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
Exciting and fun and meaningful

1824
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,344
The him and turn that into something other than

1825
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
Turning into a f****** monster that harassed

1826
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
The people in it

1827
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
Only occasionally pulls out

1828
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,280
Unfortunately the thing they gave him that Glee

1829
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
It was

1830
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,608
None dare call it conspiracy theories

1831
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:05,216
Probably a weirdo JBS John Birch Society friends

1832
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,544
Three-way last you think that Alex just saw a Bolivian once

1833
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,896
Give me wrong I knew he thought I knew you thought more than once

1834
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,944
Again of course the second time

1835
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
Dudley man

1836
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
I would have gone and seen Rush

1837
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,968
I refuse to believe that he did this

1838
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
This story has to be alive the story has to be alive because it's possible

1839
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,392
A particularly big fan

1840
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,464
I'm going to f****** rush rush

1841
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,840
Is really great I like I like

1842
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
And I do believe that

1843
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,912
Possibly could have gotten backstage

1844
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,984
Is what I understand Neil Peart is a bit of a libertarian

1845
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,776
So

1846
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Incredible

1847
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,616
And

1848
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
The love

1849
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
12

1850
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:23,808
Great album liberate those drums from boredom

1851
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
Sogo

1852
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,608
So Alex has another little bit of a story that he covers and that is that

1853
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
The AP was

1854
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,704
Except it wasn't really okay anyway

1855
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,496
This leads into more talk about

1856
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,568
Everything RC

1857
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,576
And it doesn't really hurt

1858
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,664
Programming

1859
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,200
Programming man

1860
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:28,064
How does he feel about how the blank has fallen turned into a franchise

1861
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,416
Do these dudes talk about this story super dishonest

1862
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,952
There's kind of a perception

1863
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:38,048
The Associated Press itself got hacked when in reality was just their Twitter account

1864
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
Is much easier

1865
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
To happen

1866
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,680
And someone who is hacking around

1867
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,240
Ended up posting that the White House there been

1868
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,264
Explosions in present

1869
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,288
It was injured

1870
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,128
A group called the Syrian electronic Army took credit for the hack

1871
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,200
And probably worth noting that they re pro-assad organ

1872
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,528
Innovation 2013 Obama and Assad were not on

1873
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,296
Particularly good

1874
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,112
This was not a globalist false flag

1875
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:06,208
But to know that Olympus Has Fallen was evil predictive programming

1876
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,280
I can cross that off my list three more movies are we going to drop on the

1877
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
So many

1878
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Business Club Jordan

1879
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
I think it's

1880
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,424
Fascinator

1881
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Cuz

1882
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,728
Caller calls

1883
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:23,360
And this guy wants to talk about the same sort of theories that New Hampshire

1884
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,152
House of Representative

1885
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,224
Stella Tremblay has sure about the victims

1886
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,784
Of the Boston bombing being actors

1887
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Right

1888
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,344
Now at this point Alex's heads

1889
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,392
On the show to commit open

1890
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Right answer

1891
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
Pieczenik

1892
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
Very much

1893
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
A crisis actor guy

1894
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,048
Alex has made

1895
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:46,144
Waffly overtures towards the idea that there were definitely actors

1896
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,680
In the Aurora shooting

1897
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
Sort of

1898
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,776
Dipped his toe a little bit in

1899
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,800
To Sandy Hook

1900
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:58,688
Saying that some of these people who are survivors and family members are acting weird could be like actor

1901
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,480
So I heard this caller.

1902
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,504
I wonder what Alex's

1903
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Is going to do

1904
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,552
His response

1905
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
Really shocked

1906
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:07,136
I'd like to address a popular photo

1907
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
Circulating job

1908
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,744
And possible use of actors involved at that field bomb

1909
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
The one I'm talking about

1910
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Circular the immediate relief showing us a lot

1911
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656
Of the guy with the

1912
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,960
Supposedly just lost his legs

1913
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,776
Being helped by a guy in a cowboy hat

1914
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,080
He's on a wheelchair

1915
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
Is actually a series of photos

1916
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,624
Close-up shots

1917
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,416
All the bombs site itself

1918
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
And it shows a hooded man

1919
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
Sunglass

1920
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
What looks like he's like

1921
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
Dropping the guy

1922
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,072
On the ground

1923
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,352
And then

1924
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,888
It's like all these sort of Fab

1925
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,448
Other suspicious-looking photos where

1926
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
I m like

1927
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,008
There's no actual

1928
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Black

1929
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Squirting from the

1930
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Guys like

1931
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,432
Two legs

1932
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,808
Official

1933
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,672
Over and over and over

1934
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,352
They may.

1935
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,192
Aurora

1936
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,536
And the other guy

1937
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:18,720
Signs of MS

1938
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,584
I don't care

1939
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,120
During this job

1940
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,232
I want to get into it

1941
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,704
Confirm

1942
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,544
It's not a f****** lame man so this is super interesting

1943
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,920
To me because if you really look at what he's doing he's trying to have it both ways absolutely

1944
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,248
Because he's trying to shut down this talk of actors

1945
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
But if it

1946
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
Time

1947
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Saying

1948
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,856
That these people who come out in

1949
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
And talk to the media are Act

1950
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,672
Yeah trying to

1951
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,720
To give you the official story on it

1952
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
So what key

1953
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,048
He's doing particularly about the Aurora shooting

1954
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,656
Is insisting that one of these people who claims to have been in the theater and survived the shooting

1955
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,448
Isn't actor who the globalist

1956
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,984
To put there to put out the official

1957
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
Call story

1958
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,800
That is invalidating

1959
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,104
And taking away this guy's agency

1960
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,968
And accusing him of being in on a false flag attack that killed a bunch of P

1961
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,272
So it is the same

1962
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,088
The only line he's drawing relay

1963
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,648
Is where and when the actors

1964
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
Get put into

1965
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
Interaction

1966
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,488
Somewhat but I think the more important

1967
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
When is

1968
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,096
You pushing back on the idea that people are presenting that no one

1969
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,704
That's the only thing that he seems to really have a relevant difference with

1970
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,752
With the people who are presenting the crisis

1971
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,568
It's a matter of scale

1972
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:14,432
Really is Alex is saying that some of these people who have survived these things are actors

1973
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,224
Who are paid by the globalist

1974
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
To put out the propaganda

1975
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
Right

1976
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,344
These other people are saying all of them

1977
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
That's it that's the difference

1978
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Okay

1979
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:28,000
So I kind of got what who what he was saying is that the

1980
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,072
Actors who were there are

1981
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,120
Hired right

1982
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,008
What do it so if I understand his idea his conception of their pee

1983
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,032
Alex

1984
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
Yes

1985
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,104
They are orchestrating this

1986
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,152
Mass shooting

1987
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,200
They have hired a couple of actors

1988
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
Put them in there

1989
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,808
I would say the or hired them after the show

1990
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
Which way do you think it goes

1991
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
My sense of it is

1992
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
After

1993
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,208
Or

1994
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:03,072
Yeah I don't know he's not really clear see that's that's kind of where I'm

1995
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
I'm confused as to

1996
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,704
Because if they were there and it is a real shooting

1997
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Seems too risky

1998
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,776
It seems like you wouldn't

1999
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,080
Be able to make sure that the person

2000
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,920
Isn't hit by a stray bullet

2001
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,200
Yeah I would have

2002
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
To say that it's someone who was paid

2003
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,528
After or

2004
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:28,160
They would have to have so much awareness of it to Nowhere to be building yeah

2005
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,208
I don't I don't know it's very muddy

2006
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
It's unclear

2007
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:34,560
I don't know that is that's an interesting question

2008
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
So the entire thing is orca

2009
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,632
Castrated by the globalist

2010
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
As a

2011
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,984
I guess as a mass shooting

2012
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Yes

2013
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:47,872
Then the globalist hire actors yes in order to tell the media

2014
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
That

2015
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
Do what they think happened

2016
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,528
Didn't really happen and what the globalist say happened is what he

2017
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
Yes

2018
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,344
I think

2019
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,392
Yeah it took give the official

2020
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,184
Yeah narrative

2021
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,976
But I do think that did

2022
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Have to be there

2023
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,304
In order for there to be a credibility

2024
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,376
Otherwise it doesn't make any sense

2025
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
Yeah cuz if

2026
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,472
Pressed on it to prove that you were there

2027
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:18,592
I mean I guess Alex is saying that this guy produces a ticket stub and everyone supposed to believe that that could be

2028
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,432
He's trying to imply the first

2029
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,200
Wasn't that

2030
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,224
Right

2031
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:27,552
I don't know and if not official story then

2032
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
You have

2033
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:32,160
We don't need to hire actors you got cops

2034
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:32,928
To say would have

2035
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,512
It's really bizarre I don't know but I think that

2036
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,864
I think the most important thing cuz I don't think we're ever going to get the bottom

2037
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,704
I think the most important thing

2038
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,752
Is Alex is already

2039
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
In terms of saying

2040
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,336
This is like people are actors

2041
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
But he's just

2042
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Not committed

2043
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
2

2044
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,200
The larger

2045
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Picture of everyone

2046
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,040
Rick B weide

2047
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,064
Spread that there's a

2048
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,856
He's already deaf

2049
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,136
Currently saying that it's

2050
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,952
Worthwhile to suspect some of the people

2051
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,280
Yeah being actors so I almost feel like our investigation

2052
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,584
I mean it's just

2053
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
It's complete but it's it's

2054
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,680
It is already happened

2055
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
There's just a matter of him getting to the point where

2056
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,056
Is full then narrative is

2057
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,848
Right it's already started

2058
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,872
Right right right

2059
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,920
No what do you get started a long time

2060
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,944
Hemoglobin

2061
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,480
His material difference

2062
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,320
His material difference from the people who say no one died at Sandy Hook

2063
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,880
Is that he thinks some people died at Sandy Hook

2064
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
Yeah and that's it

2065
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,232
Otherwise there are crisis actors because they have

2066
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
Be hired in order to give

2067
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,816
Yeah give the statement

2068
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:49,216
The whole thing is a false flag and it's just it's just he thinks that they like killing people in other people are like

2069
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
They didn't

2070
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
They wouldn't kill any

2071
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,640
And if they like if Alex is saying that this guy who survived the Aurora shooting

2072
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,920
Is lying

2073
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
In order to

2074
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,504
Put forth

2075
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,784
The globalist narrative

2076
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,088
It's not a far leap from that

2077
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,624
To the Sandy Hook families

2078
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,416
He's also are doing the same thing

2079
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,232
So it is because the behavior is the same

2080
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,792
They're in the media giving the globalist

2081
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,096
Talking points about this

2082
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Tragedy

2083
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,704
And so was the guy who survived the Aurora shooting right

2084
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,752
It's it's the same

2085
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,544
It's just a matter of

2086
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,336
Putting it where it's

2087
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
Inevitably going to

2088
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,920
Yeah and furthermore it means that they

2089
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
The

2090
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
The

2091
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
Globalist

2092
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:36,064
Didn't just like engineer a mass shooting but they engineered eggs

2093
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,112
Exactly how it would go down

2094
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,904
And then hired

2095
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Something like that

2096
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:45,536
So Alex gets back to the tamerlan

2097
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,816
Russian story

2098
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,376
This

2099
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,400
Is really important

2100
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,704
Breaking news

2101
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,896
In Georgia training under a CIA program

2102
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
That clip I think is so crucial

2103
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832
Is it perfectly illustrates the way Alex jump

2104
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Conclusions

2105
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,648
The actual news is a

2106
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:18,048
Possibly unreliable Russian media Outlet is claimed they have documents from the Georgian interior Ministry that shows that

2107
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,864
Georgian foundation and the Jamestown Foundation

2108
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
We're recruiting people to meddle with Russia

2109
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,984
They don't say anything about the CIA and they don't prove or even

2110
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,056
Specifically assert that tamerlan was definitely one of these m

2111
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,616
The Russian media Outlet did not really

2112
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
He's documented for all we know they may or may not eat

2113
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,200
Exist

2114
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,992
But you hear her Alex reports

2115
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:43,392
He says that tamerlan quote on record documents released in Georgia training under CIA program

2116
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,696
None of that even relates to the sources work

2117
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,000
That's how it's making things up

2118
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,304
And it's so important to understand the little things

2119
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,840
Eggs and why he does what he does

2120
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
He's talking like this

2121
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
Got to make

2122
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,960
Kids conclusions which are just his imagination

2123
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,008
Sound definitive and authoritative

2124
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,544
It's on record

2125
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,824
So it's definitely true

2126
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
The documents are released

2127
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:06,432
Which creates the perception that Alex has seen these documents

2128
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
Vespa certainty of his reporting

2129
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,784
None of this has proven but Alex intense

2130
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,576
Family doesn't show in such a way

2131
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Is to make his audience

2132
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,160
But he's definitively proven all of these poi

2133
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,464
It's something he does literally all the

2134
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
It's how you take baseless

2135
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
Is conjecture and presented as hard research

2136
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
Artifact

2137
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
It's how you act like a dumb

2138
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,632
Conspiracy theorist

2139
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,424
A pass yourself off as an extra

2140
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,008
It's as easy as manufacturing evidence and misleading your audience

2141
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
That's all he

2142
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
Particularly distasteful

2143
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,152
The documents have been released

2144
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
Represent

2145
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
Producers.

2146
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:45,344
Okay well I put them in my safe because they're way too important so

2147
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,880
I will just go get them

2148
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Jump up legs

2149
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
So we

2150
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
See that narrative transition

2151
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
We see it start

2152
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,376
Russian is vestia story

2153
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,680
And Alex has now changed it

2154
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:02,240
Dude that Timberland on record documents

2155
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,800
Released using to CIA program in Georgia

2156
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,592
In the same way

2157
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,944
Alex takes the story of Timberland being a fan of Infowars

2158
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
And change

2159
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
Is that story as well

2160
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
And we see that in

2161
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:20,160
Next clip we're usually recording CNN Fox in a bunch of others when there's breaking news

2162
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,568
Alex Jones listeners

2163
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,832
Admission at Langley Virginia

2164
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:55,488
So as soon as the suspect in the marathon bombings had been neutralized as an immediate threat

2165
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,280
Actions of why did they do what they did

2166
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:01,120
And interviews of the Johor it became clear that tamerlan had some religious

2167
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,144
Just extremism to him

2168
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,960
I'm so investigators wanted to discern where that it come from

2169
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:11,616
Timberlands father Ruslan told CNN's of a man named Misha who is said to have been Timberlands

2170
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,944
Brainwashed him into an extreme version of Isla

2171
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,784
Christian Carol writer for the New York Review of Books

2172
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Extractme shutdown

2173
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,856
And reported on their conversation

2174
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:24,672
Mitch's real name was me kli lock

2175
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,744
And he claimed that

2176
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,048
You thought that though he knew tamerlan

2177
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,888
If you've actually been his teacher as it was being alleged you would have stopped him

2178
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,912
From carrying out the bombing

2179
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,448
Absolutely did not support

2180
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:43,872
Misha agreed to cooperate with the FBI and officials came out and announced that they could find no link to

2181
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:44,896
I'm in the bombing

2182
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:49,248
In the end mission was a bit of a red herring though the attention on him kind of makes sense

2183
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
Thanksgiving-themed

2184
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,088
Yeah media tone all the

2185
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,880
The confusion surrounding

2186
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:59,232
Timberlands father it indicated that Misha was responsible for radicalizing his

2187
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,280
But he only knew him by this student

2188
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,304
And that's

2189
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,072
Redmi 4

2190
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,632
Mysterious figure

2191
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,168
Perfect for creating intrigue

2192
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,704
So I don't know how they could have resisted

2193
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Reporting on this

2194
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
The Talk

2195
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:14,080
Alex is suggesting that Mischa is in Langley because that's shorthand

2196
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
For the CIA

2197
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:20,480
Pretend that Misha is a CIA operative which is why Misha would say that the Tsarnaev brothers were fans

2198
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
Infowars

2199
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,296
Where is Langley CIA or FBI

2200
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,880
There's no evidence that Misha was CIA

2201
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,928
A few days after this

2202
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,464
Point where at you sound living in a

2203
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,280
Apartment in West Warwick Rhode Island with his elderly pay

2204
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:39,936
Alex's created The Narrative that tamerlan was working with the CIA thanks for the shoddy story from his vestia

2205
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
So now anyone associated with him must also be

2206
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,520
CIA

2207
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,288
Is bad work

2208
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:50,432
But the larger structural problem with this narrative is that music wasn't the one who said tamerlan was into Infowars

2209
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
That information

2210
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,016
Cut came from

2211
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,320
Who was tamerlan sisters

2212
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,088
Text husband

2213
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,160
That bit of information about Timberlands media diet is

2214
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,720
Completely separate from the thread about his possible

2215
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
With Misha

2216
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,536
But Alex wants to muddy the water

2217
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,328
And the reason he wants to do that

2218
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
Because at this

2219
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:11,424
Point on the 24th the ex brother-in-law is a known quantity

2220
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,472
He's someone that definitely exists

2221
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,032
Tangible way but Misha does not

2222
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,896
As of April 24th meet your only really existed someone who's been talked about

2223
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,664
It hasn't been

2224
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
Confound

2225
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,224
So it's good makeup anything you want

2226
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,552
This is a mini version of his larger content of

2227
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,320
About the bombing

2228
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,136
Alex thrives on manufacturing certainty

2229
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:33,440
In places where reality reflects

2230
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
Vagueness

2231
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,792
Because Misha is an unknown quantity that being reported as a

2232
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,072
Mysterious figure by the meat

2233
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:44,192
It's analysis best interest to attach the idea that tamerlan was into Infowars to him

2234
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,472
Because of the uncertainty

2235
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:48,032
Surrounding Misha Alex decline with no evidence

2236
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,056
But he's CIA

2237
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,080
And that means what

2238
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,896
Infowars it's probably coming from

2239
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,920
The CIA

2240
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
Because they were behind the bombings

2241
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,784
Which is all meant to demonize the Patriots after all

2242
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,088
So even so they have to do it

2243
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,880
At a one step removed

2244
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:03,904
Situation

2245
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,744
Oz content Works backwards most of the time

2246
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
There's a conclusion that he needs

2247
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Just arrived at anymore

2248
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,840
Reality to support that

2249
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Conclusion

2250
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,912
In the case of his entire coverage of the bombing

2251
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
The conclusion

2252
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
That must be reached

2253
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,800
Is this was a false flag that was meant to be blamed on Patriots and gun owner

2254
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,592
There's no evidence at this

2255
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:27,712
The case no one seems to be blaming right-wingers at all but Alex need something to justify his narrative

2256
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,992
And this'll do just fine

2257
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:34,368
Instead of accepting the very likely reality that someone who is deeply interested in the protocols of

2258
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:37,440
The Elders of Zion would also find his broadcast appealing

2259
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,744
Play because they're almost identical in

2260
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,280
Alex has to deflect

2261
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:44,096
It cannot be possible that this guy was a fan

2262
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,888
It must be the case

2263
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,680
That the claim that he the fan is

2264
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
From the global

2265
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
Who see this as their best

2266
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,776
Chance to blame the Patriots for

2267
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,544
The bombing

2268
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,080
In some way after all

2269
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,384
I kind of understand why you do this

2270
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,944
Considering that the alternative is publicly owning up

2271
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,992
To the fact that you show appeals to terrorists

2272
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,016
So

2273
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:05,600
You got to do what you got to do usually admitting that

2274
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,392
You are running a show that

2275
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,696
The main demographic

2276
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
People who wanted

2277
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
Commit violence

2278
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,512
Citizens

2279
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,816
Usually that's not the way you go about

2280
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,096
Yeah

2281
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,960
Strange this is business good on his part like I mean

2282
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:24,032
It's sloppy and terrible and the motivation

2283
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,360
V b I can see why you would do this

2284
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Yeah and it's slippery

2285
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,944
But I hesitate to call it smart

2286
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,224
But it's wise

2287
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,040
It's on what goal he's trying to reach

2288
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:39,392
He's doing exactly what he needs to do in order to do that

2289
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,184
Yeah

2290
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,720
Smart is a

2291
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
Got too much

2292
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
Connotation

2293
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,304
Value

2294
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,096
So Alex is now decided that

2295
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,120
She's probably behind

2296
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,720
Was involved in

2297
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,256
Drill

2298
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,560
Sure

2299
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,608
Baby missions behind everything

2300
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:26,240
This is really getting hard to deal with this point

2301
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,544
I can imagine you just made that up

2302
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,896
Yeah you can't have a hard time dealing with something that you literally just made up to 2nd

2303
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,224
I think what he's saying is hard to deal with is

2304
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,016
He's got his narrative

2305
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:38,784
And there's just

2306
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,624
Too much information coming out that he has to incorporate

2307
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:47,744
And it becomes exhausting well

2308
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,768
Radicalizing

2309
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,072
Figure that is father's achtung about

2310
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:53,376
How does this fit into my conspiracy

2311
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:56,192
Well okay you CIA

2312
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,568
Maybe you did

2313
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,848
Old is maybe he did

2314
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:05,152
The bro it's almost like he's

2315
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
Graphic designer and

2316
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:13,600
Every time he sends it to the guys like you know what I really think that's close but maybe change this a little bit and over and over and

2317
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,624
Turn over again Alex

2318
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
Dealing with reality

2319
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:23,328
Now they're asking me to put Misha in here how am I supposed to fit another character in I don't know

2320
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,608
Babies

2321
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,656
That's cool

2322
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:30,240
That's kind of what I hear to almost a frustration

2323
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,264
Supposed to f******

2324
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,800
Work with

2325
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,616
You did this to yourself

2326
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,968
Could have just waited for information I really hate this novel that I'm being

2327
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,992
Forced to write

2328
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,272
Somebody

2329
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,576
So Tremblay

2330
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:48,672
Isn't the only government official that is saying things that Alex Jones

2331
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,208
This is pretty into

2332
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:53,024
Also we have some commentary by

2333
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,304
The one and only

2334
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,584
Beach ambulance

2335
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:56,864
But Alex

2336
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
Misrepresent

2337
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,568
Boston bombing in advance Georgia Senator Saxby

2338
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,384
Channel 2 Action News

2339
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Last night

2340
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:18,880
Russian news

2341
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:22,464
Boston bombers

2342
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:27,840
But Alex is completely twisting the comments that sexbeat ramblas made about the alarm for 7 a.m.

2343
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,632
We haven't advanced warning about the bombing

2344
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:33,728
This is specifically about the warnings that the Russian government gave about tamerlan back in

2345
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,776
11th and how that information

2346
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,848
Didn't get cheer to all the places that it might have been helpful for it to get to

2347
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:43,968
The way Alex reads this story throughout the show it's meant to imply that the law enforcement

2348
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
Question

2349
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,272
Add specific for knowledge

2350
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:48,320
About the bombing it didn't do anything

2351
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,624
Stop it just absolutely not with Champlin

2352
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
What was Elijah

2353
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
Nor is there any evidence

2354
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Conclusion that's been

2355
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:55,232
Produced

2356
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,792
Chambliss the senator from Georgia

2357
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,352
NetSpend

2358
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:04,960
Fun coincidence there that the senator from Georgia is talking about

2359
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,776
Conspiracy theory of the guide

2360
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,312
But I didn't put two-and-two together

2361
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
That's fun

2362
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:13,920
Coincidence and I'm no sex be shambliss Defender

2363
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:18,272
Except for how fun is named has to say but in this case is point Isabel

2364
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:23,648
There was a failure of information-sharing that it possibly could have contributed to Tamara Lynn

2365
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,184
Falling off relevant radar

2366
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,280
It's unclear how much of a contribution that had in terms of allowing the bombing

2367
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,840
To happen but it's definitely a productive Avenue

2368
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,608
For conversation

2369
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,632
And after the bombing

2370
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,240
It's just unfortunate that media Outlets decided to present this information with headlines like

2371
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,776
Quote chambliss

2372
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:46,176
Law enforcement agency might have had info about Boston bombing in advance

2373
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,224
Why was a bad actor like Alex to create the

2374
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:48,992
Kind of Optics

2375
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,784
He needs which in no way reflects

2376
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,600
So that's kind of what we're dealing with their

2377
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
There is

2378
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,672
I think it's just because there's so many

2379
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,256
Yeah like you could be sex

2380
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
He could be Saxby

2381
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,328
Chambliss

2382
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,656
Saxby chambliss

2383
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
It's at

2384
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,448
Saex

2385
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,472
Bewhy

2386
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,008
Zaxby

2387
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
Chambliss

2388
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,312
Or Zack

2389
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,592
B.

2390
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,360
During the

2391
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:21,760
2008 election me and my buddy Swearingen where

2392
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
We were hanging out

2393
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,112
I don't know if we lived together at the time we did end up being room

2394
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
I think it was

2395
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,648
Before we love to go

2396
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,416
Heather butts

2397
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,208
We're watching the election results

2398
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,488
Come in

2399
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:34,304
And we had a bottle of Goldschlager

2400
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,168
We're drinking every time estate went Democrat

2401
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,960
Obama

2402
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,240
And

2403
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:45,824
Just because earlier in the night Saxby chambliss had won a race

2404
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:51,712
We had no idea who he was but I was so great that every time we drank we cheers

2405
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:56,064
Saxby chambliss

2406
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,624
Oh my God what's his Vermont

2407
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,256
It's always have a pretty positive

2408
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,816
Weird

2409
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,608
He's a pretty bad dude

2410
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,376
Gap

2411
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,400
So

2412
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,680
Alex gets into this

2413
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
Text Clippers

2414
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:16,288
In this excellent. Gets into how they were going to blame the Patriot

2415
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,080
And the right-wing gun owners

2416
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,384
Auburn it didn't work out so now this

2417
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:21,920
2

2418
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,456
Make it Alex's fault

2419
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:26,016
Is them trying to

2420
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,064
Say Victory from the jaws of

2421
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,072
They were CIA

2422
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Confirm now

2423
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,056
But

2424
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:53,920
Here's his first

2425
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:58,784
So no one is saying that tamerlan liking Infowars made him do the bus

2426
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,552
Embalming

2427
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,320
Except for alley

2428
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:06,208
Is the straw man that Alex is deploying to attack because he knows better than to engage at the actual reality

2429
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:10,560
Where Alex to discuss this story as it's actually being reported he have to bring up

2430
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,608
Tamerlan was into the protocols of the elders

2431
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
Zion

2432
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,424
And that would bring up some difficult question

2433
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:19,008
Because the protocols are Sophie matically connected to his world

2434
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,592
Discussing this issue in reality would force them to address the fact that

2435
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,616
Globalist

2436
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:27,456
Just yells about are real similar and characterization and in goals with the l

2437
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,480
Elders of Zion

2438
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,272
Which is a really tough line for Alex

2439
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,088
Did he say that the protocols are real

2440
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:37,440
That would take a show into a pretty overtly anti-semitic place and I'm not sure he thinks that's good

2441
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
For business

2442
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,280
Maybe he could save their real but it's not about the Jews

2443
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,608
That seems like a little bit too hard for him to pull off in

2444
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:47,680
It's embarrassing when other people have tried that in the past

2445
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,984
I turned the thread that needle probably blow up in his

2446
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,800
In space-plus he probably be accused of ripping off Bill Cooper

2447
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,592
So what option would be like

2448
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,384
Sing the protocols are fake

2449
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,920
If that's the case then this

2450
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:02,528
Historical forgery that the complete hoax meant to demonize the Jews

2451
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,296
And it has

2452
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:05,600
Staggering overlap with his rhetoric and worldview

2453
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,392
What does that mean for the infowar

2454
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,696
These are not questions that Alex's equipped

2455
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:15,840
To deal with so instead of recognizing the tamerlan had an interest in the protocols and Infowars probably

2456
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,936
He just pretends that everyone is saying that Infowars made tamerlan into a terror

2457
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,008
Jump like that he's off the hook for the hard question

2458
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,336
And he's created a completely false accusation that he can get indict

2459
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,360
About people making

2460
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:32,480
Plus it validates the narratives about the globalist finding a way to blame the Patriots with the bombing

2461
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,296
Exactly what he needs to do but ultimately

2462
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:38,112
And it's also

2463
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,648
In a certain way

2464
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
Flattering for

2465
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:41,696
He's he's

2466
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:43,744
Framing in such a way as

2467
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,304
They think I have that power

2468
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,096
To turn anyone into a

2469
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
Of course I do

2470
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,424
I could never do

2471
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,728
You know that kind

2472
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,008
That's pretty wild

2473
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
So Alex

2474
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
Sayonara

2475
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,080
I wish this were

2476
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,152
I wish I wish this was a real Attack

2477
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,432
It wasn't the false flag

2478
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,992
Affect your work

2479
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,464
I don't want this to be an inside job

2480
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,008
You so giddy

2481
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,032
So giddy

2482
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,824
It's

2483
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,872
Tell me that's that that's the real

2484
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,640
Face there

2485
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,968
That's so excited to be linked

2486
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
So Alex

2487
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,832
Sarah has a story that one of his writers

2488
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:41,600
This has put out

2489
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:43,136
Trying to deflect

2490
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,160
From the idea that

2491
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,184
Tamerlan was a fan of

2492
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,232
And this is just absurd

2493
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:54,144
Boston bombers

2494
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:57,216
Michael Jackson demo Thrones Finding Nemo

2495
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:02,336
Facebook and social media

2496
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:12,576
Spider-Man

2497
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:18,208
So here Alex is one of his employees write an article desperately trying to create another straw man

2498
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,512
Antop escape the connection between his working

2499
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,560
This time ago this

2500
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:26,144
How to say an interesting Infowars it the same thing as an interest in Spider-Man

2501
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,960
Therefore if you're saying that it's a notable that tamerlan was in

2502
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
Infowars

2503
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,008
It's equally rella

2504
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,544
He was into Spider-Man

2505
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:39,456
Which I think is wrong because we all know that Finding Nemo is the movie that has the most anti-government

2506
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Sure

2507
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
This is a joke

2508
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,832
The issue was tamerlan taking an interest in Infowars that they did

2509
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,880
It speaks to the worldview that tamerlan was called

2510
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,440
According to that report in the associated

2511
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,976
His family members said that he

2512
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
You changed a bit

2513
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,024
Years before the bombing

2514
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,072
Becoming convinced of a broad range of

2515
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:55,840
Conspiracy theory

2516
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:01,216
He became a 9-11 truther it was dabbling in these ideas that Jews secretly Run the World

2517
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,752
He began have a very

2518
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Anti us

2519
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Stamp

2520
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,336
To the point where people around him

2521
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,104
Took notice

2522
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:12,736
Well it isn't necessarily fair to say that Infowars is responsible for radicalizing tamerlan it's

2523
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:15,552
Equally unfair to pretend that it's not part of the equation

2524
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,832
According to Tamlyn

2525
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
Brother-in-law

2526
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:19,648
Not Misha the way Alex.

2527
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,696
The fascination with

2528
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,488
Conspiracy theories particularly

2529
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:24,256
Anti-government

2530
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,328
Runs a very parallel track with getting into infowar

2531
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:30,400
Believing the Jews run the world and becoming a

2532
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,472
Didn't the protocols of Elders of Zion is absolutely

2533
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
Hannibal

2534
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,544
With the themes disseminated by Infowars

2535
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,360
Even if Alex doesn't save the Jews are secretly behind every

2536
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,152
The themes of the same

2537
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,944
The anti-semitic tropes are used

2538
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,224
Characterize the globalist

2539
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,272
Extent that most people who are getting in

2540
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,296
Semitism

2541
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:50,624
Could be forgiven if they heard what Alex said as cold

2542
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,160
This is why you never

2543
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,488
Infowars is relevant and an interest in Spider-Man

2544
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
Is not

2545
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:58,304
And be clear I'm not saying that

2546
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,840
Infowars or Alex

2547
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,120
Radicalized tamerlan

2548
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,704
I don't have anywhere near the amount of evidence I would need to make that kind of claim

2549
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:10,336
I am saying that if Alex were sincere actor in the world he would respond to things like this different

2550
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,408
He wouldn't get defensive and create multiple defense

2551
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:17,504
It's narratives about Wyatt means nothing the tamerlan liked Infowars he probably didn't

2552
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,576
Because that's just coming from Misha who's probably CIA

2553
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,648
You would reflect on what he's doing and ask hard question

2554
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
Particularly

2555
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:27,232
What is it about what I do that makes it attractive

2556
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,536
Do to people who subscribe to ideologies

2557
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
Support

2558
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,120
What unexamined parts in my worker

2559
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,704
Compatible with toxic and important beliefs like those expressed by the

2560
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,472
The protocols

2561
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
And what can I

2562
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,264
My dude better

2563
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,080
To make sure my message that I'm sending isn't misunder

2564
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,128
Understood as support those ideologies

2565
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,176
Alex contra-flow

2566
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:48,224
Because to reflect is to introduce

2567
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:48,992
Possibility

2568
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:49,760
He's wrong about

2569
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,808
And he's wrong about something

2570
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,576
That introduces

2571
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,112
The possibilities wrong about ever

2572
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,160
It's so important for him to

2573
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,512
Because he's up there on the edges where he's most vulnerable

2574
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:03,072
He has to protect his infallibility

2575
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:06,400
Which drives them to do observe childish nonsense like this

2576
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,936
Like making is writers

2577
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:11,520
Put out articles behind interest in Spider-Man is equivalent

2578
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:14,592
Do an interest in an extremist right-wing propaganda out

2579
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
Bulshit

2580
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,152
Very sad

2581
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:17,920
Yeah

2582
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:24,832
And it's not like the thing about that is that it is not the

2583
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
It's not like

2584
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,136
Infowars makes him

2585
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:27,904
I hate the government

2586
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,928
Or whatever it is

2587
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,744
I'm extremely anti US government

2588
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:35,072
The pathways that you take

2589
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,864
Evidence of Infowars

2590
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,632
Influence

2591
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,400
Not

2592
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,704
Not the initial starting point

2593
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,544
It's Fitbit you know you go to Infowars because you're already

2594
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:47,616
Inklings at Leeds

2595
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,896
Do to find it

2596
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,712
We'll put it is it doesn't lead anywhere

2597
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,528
It's going to

2598
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,320
To take whatever you have

2599
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:58,112
Metastasize

2600
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,672
It's not obviously

2601
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,440
100

2602
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,208
Percent

2603
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:02,976
Effective

2604
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,536
It doesn't it say it's not something

2605
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,816
It happens to everyone

2606
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:09,376
But if they're on that path Infowars will make

2607
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,448
It'll convince them of things that aren't true

2608
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,032
It'll create narratives in their head that are based on

2609
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
Alex is paranoid delusional

2610
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,128
A movie

2611
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,920
Eduardo movies

2612
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,736
And Fantasies delusions about those

2613
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,504
Is being real

2614
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,832
You know it is

2615
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:31,136
Break it all it all makes total

2616
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:34,208
And the way Alex is doing this makes total sense

2617
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:34,976
That's too because

2618
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:36,768
Dealing

2619
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:40,352
Dealing with these things in a more realistic ways very very threatening

2620
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:42,912
To the way he presents his show and his business

2621
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:43,936
ISO

2622
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:45,984
Obviously the most threatened

2623
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:46,752
Nothing to him

2624
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:48,032
Is people treating

2625
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,056
Realistically

2626
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,616
It's not a threat for them to attack him

2627
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:53,664
In the ways that let's say

2628
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,712
The virulently

2629
02:01:55,968 --> 02:02:00,064
Somatic people do when they say that he works for his real

2630
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,672
That's not really tell me

2631
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:07,232
Not at all people attacking him insane

2632
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,024
Like hey you

2633
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,560
Cause this bombing

2634
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,608
That's not even really that

2635
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:17,216
Threatening to really I caused the bombing I'm a radio show host

2636
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:20,032
Spider-Man goes away

2637
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:20,800
Don't understand

2638
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,336
Of this American

2639
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,640
Green him and the ideology

2640
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,664
That do

2641
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,200
Underlie people who

2642
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:27,968
End up committing

2643
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,016
This tax is very threat

2644
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
Yeah

2645
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,856
Pointing out that he operates under the same propaganda

2646
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:34,880
Fix that

2647
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,672
Isis for example uses

2648
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:38,464
So we are one lion

2649
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,488
I slept here

2650
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:42,048
And you might remember that Alex said that Lindsey Williams

2651
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
Interesting Lee

2652
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,168
Oz interview with Lindsey Williams

2653
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:49,984
Cut out of the episode as it appears on his rssb

2654
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
Wait what

2655
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
Yeah

2656
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,568
I thought that was really bizarre

2657
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,360
And I don't think I've ever run into that

2658
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,128
In the past

2659
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,152
Like I do

2660
02:02:57,408 --> 02:03:01,504
On the top of these episodes I've never heard an instance where Alex says aghast

2661
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,552
Is coming up the guest never shows up

2662
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:09,952
Eddie doesn't say like we had a scheduling issue or can't get ahold of him Lindsey just never shows up on the episode

2663
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,256
So I went and found the full version

2664
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:15,072
This episode and I listen to the Lindy Williams interview

2665
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:17,120
It seems pretty par for the course for a Mac

2666
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:19,168
It's also pretty embarrassing

2667
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:24,288
Wendy Williams is just doing his normal stick of pretending to have this Elite inside or information

2668
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:27,616
Somebody uses to issue dire warnings about the coming Financial collapse

2669
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,152
All this prediction

2670
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:32,224
Stupid and they're very clearly

2671
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,272
His appearance is very clearly

2672
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,320
Listen to me about trying to sell his DVD

2673
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,904
I suspect however in this case Lindsey Williams

2674
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:47,584
Alex's fine with Lindsey selling his DVDs as a byproduct of them coming on the show to give Alex quote-unquote inside information

2675
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,352
Mason from this

2676
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,376
Quote on quote

2677
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,424
Imagine

2678
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:52,448
But I'll

2679
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,216
Can't accept

2680
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:53,984
What's the inverse

2681
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:57,312
You can't allow the appearance to be that Lindsay's

2682
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:59,360
Primarily there to sell DVDs

2683
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,664
He's doing that by

2684
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
Pretending

2685
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,200
The source

2686
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,480
And I think Lindsay cross

2687
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,784
Here's how that interview ends

2688
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,832
I think it's I think it speaks

2689
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,160
And why I got cut out of the episode they got released

2690
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:14,464
Also I should say that what we listen

2691
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,512
Do here is the third time

2692
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,792
I'm in like 15 minutes

2693
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,840
That Lindsay launched into a sales

2694
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,888
Bottom line

2695
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:23,168
They are

2696
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:26,496
That's the state of plans of the globalist

2697
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:30,592
To get our Pension funds in my account what you got on the waterfront

2698
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:33,408
Premier associate you're saying number of months

2699
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,944
How long

2700
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,760
Lovingly

2701
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:41,600
Taking over retirement accounts to safeguard them but also

2702
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,904
Tax them all this is after tax money

2703
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,952
I mean why not it's for the Earth Lindsey

2704
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,304
Please go to Lindsey Williams.

2705
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:57,472
Sey

2706
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:59,520
Lindsey Williams

2707
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,848
I have produced this week

2708
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,856
Today

2709
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:21,280
799

2710

6111 American operators by the way 888

2711
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,960
799 even about that

2712
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:47,648
Out of time I appreciate it unless he's a great guy he really does have that Source I'm not paid about the stuff when he comes on

2713
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:50,720
I'ma like Lindsey I like to stuff it starts you know

2714
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,512
Making us have important information but

2715
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,536
Adverb

2716
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:56,352
You know Cancer Care and stuff like that I just not part of it

2717
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:58,656
That's all I can say right there

2718
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,448
Infomercial with

2719
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:05,568
Youngevity stop cuz I really believe it and tested it until it is Clemson's done studies on it really as powerful

2720
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:09,664
And my sponsors are great if you hear me and or something that's my sponsor but

2721
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,992
Appreciate that Lindsey Williams Come on with us we're going to break now

2722
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,832
That's f***** up

2723
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:23,232
Cuz he says they're at the ends at like I infomercial for youngevity sometimes cuz I believe in that stuff which seems

2724
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:26,304
To imply that he doesn't believe in Lindsay's.

2725
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:28,096
No he does not

2726
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,424
Of course that's what get

2727
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:35,776
We've gone through so many of these old episodes where you're like

2728
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:39,872
Why the f*** did you leave that in you could have just cut that out

2729
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,640
But what gets

2730
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,408
Cut out

2731
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:46,784
A f****** sales pitch will the time with a guest of his made it way too overt

2732
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,088
That he's there teasing

2733
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,880
Fake inside information

2734
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,672
In order to sell these DVDs

2735
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:55,232
It makes it the grift way to up yeah man

2736
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:57,280
So you don't want that to live on

2737
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:59,840
In terms of

2738
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,912
Really easily accessible

2739
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:07,776
I lied or I misspoke there's one more clip and tell Alex

2740
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,544
And the episode

2741
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,104
He's teasing the knot Lindsey Williams

2742
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,872
Kind of

2743
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:14,432
I think he's mocking Lindsey Williams a little bit

2744
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,224
As he teases the Nightly News

2745
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:28,000
Boston prisonplanet.tv

2746
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:41,568
Tennessee login

2747
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,896
So when Alex says that you won't cure cancer

2748
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:51,296
Printing back to just like a little bit earlier when you were saying about Lindsey I'm not into the cancer can

2749
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,320
I don't think that's

2750
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:57,184
Specifically about Lindsey Williams selling a cancer cure it just more metaphorical

2751
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,256
That he's offering this miracle thing that isn't real

2752
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,048
So I think

2753
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:04,352
I don't know this to be sure

2754
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:06,400
Wait bug Lindsey Williams cell

2755
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:09,984
I don't think so about the globalist

2756
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,776
Then how are you knows this Elite

2757
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,056
Mystery source

2758
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,080
Hotels in bad infer

2759
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,104
Information

2760
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,384
I don't know this.

2761
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,176
Be sure but I

2762
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:20,480
Tried to Google like Lindsey Williams appearances

2763
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,784
Does on Alex's show and I think this is the last time he's

2764
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:27,904
I'm not positive about that but all the other ones were from like 2009 2000

2765
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:31,744
Domino's this might be the end of their relationship

2766
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:35,328
Reply to close to the Sun in like Icarus

2767
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,888
Your DVDs melt yeah you have to at least

2768
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,912
Answer his

2769
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:41,216
OceanFirst you can launch into the sales

2770
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,520
If he asked you a direct question and

2771
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,544
And instead you launched

2772
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,312
Do the sales pitch

2773
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,848
You get cut out of the oven

2774
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:53,248
And Alex absolutely was not out of time out of time to Overdrive

2775
02:08:55,808 --> 02:09:01,696
Call mad all the time in the world

2776
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,464
After Lynn

2777
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,000
Interview

2778
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:07,840
Who is realize that cuz I got to the end of the episode

2779
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:10,144
That's not good out there plenty of

2780
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,168
Wow

2781
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,472
So we get to the end of this episode I think

2782
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
This is really

2783
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,288
Very fascinating

2784
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:18,592
Because you have the

2785
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
The first

2786
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,920
Thing is you know you got the

2787
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,688
Timberland

2788
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,224
That's

2789
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
Fascinating

2790
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,272
Seahawks response

2791
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:27,040
That is really in

2792
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:30,624
But then I don't know where you got this is vestia store

2793
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:32,672
Russian news story

2794
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:34,464
That's how you see how Alex

2795
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:35,488
Changes at

2796
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:37,280
You see how he manipulates

2797
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,048
The details

2798
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:43,424
Is so vague about the sources people can't like his listeners can't verify anything that he saying

2799
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,704
Turns it into

2800
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,472
Proof

2801
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,240
Document

2802
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,544
Release everything is proven that

2803
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,616
Timberland was recruited by the CIA in Georgia

2804
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:52,640
Boom

2805
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,664
Then

2806
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,944
He brings back

2807
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,224
The

2808
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,296
Tamerlan was a fan of Infowars narrative

2809
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,600
Connected to this music character

2810
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,136
And integrate that

2811
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
With

2812
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,672
That is vest

2813
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:05,440
Story

2814
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:08,768
In order to make it so everything is the CIA

2815
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
Everything

2816
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:13,376
They're the ones were saying that tamerlan was a fan of Infowars

2817
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,656
In order to

2818
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,192
Satisfy Alex's

2819
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:16,960
Prophecy

2820
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,264
They were going to find a way to blame the page

2821
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,056
It's really

2822
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,336
It's really interesting

2823
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,360
It all works

2824
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,384
It all works

2825
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,408
If you believe him

2826
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,944
Yeah yeah yeah

2827
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:31,040
It's it's kind of amazing cuz what we're watching is him rewrite

2828
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,624
Reality in real time

2829
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:41,024
You know like and that's probably why you so tired as normally he gets to have other people write articles for him

2830
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,328
And then he can do it but this is almost all

2831
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,864
It feels

2832
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:51,776
Like him about the story when he started

2833
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:55,104
Sara Lee it did Italy's doesn't seem like it until

2834
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,896
Two-thirds of the way through the episode

2835
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:59,456
Yeah but that's the same thing he's been doing with his whole body

2836
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:02,528
For quite a while

2837
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:03,808
I think

2838
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:07,392
I think that element of it made this episode little bit more into

2839
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,416
Interesting than some of the

2840
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,952
Last couple days

2841
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,256
Cuz those have been so

2842
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,536
Like standard out

2843
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:15,840
Alex yeah where's this is a little bit more

2844
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:17,888
It feels a little more improvisational

2845
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,168
You can see the instinct

2846
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,216
A little more than just the like

2847
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:24,032
Alright boring dumb propaganda

2848
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,312
Dumb conspiracy

2849
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,104
MN.

2850
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:27,872
So I mean

2851
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,920
It was it was

2852
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,944
Really

2853
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:33,504
Illuminating to see that Misha thing

2854
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,064
Happened so quickly like it went from

2855
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:42,976
I just found out about Misha to maybe Misha was this guy over here and then these this

2856
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:48,864
Everything and he's CIA and then all of a sudden that all crystallized into truth

2857
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:55,264
Yeah and it was concrete and he knew the whole beef of the soda I don't have a strong suspicion I don't know this.

2858
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,824
Suspicion that that is not going

2859
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,592
Tubi

2860
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:03,200
Behind the drills

2861
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:04,992
In Rhode Island

2862
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:05,760
And Alexander

2863
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:09,600
Sure it'll be it'll be

2864
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,648
Something stupid but it won't be that

2865
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,464
So I don't know I'm interested

2866
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,232
See where this goes

2867
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,256
There's still a

2868
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,792
Even if there is

2869
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:22,400
Feeling that I have that I kind of feel like Alex is already on the crisis actors

2870
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,960
Yeah yeah that clip I think is real

2871
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:26,752
Illuminating on that front

2872
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:30,848
I still think that there's more that a greater fault

2873
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:31,616
But he has to make

2874
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:32,384
I'm still in

2875
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,432
And then there's one

2876
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,200
Big p

2877
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,736
Of the Boston

2878
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:37,504
Bombing

2879
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,784
Narratives that

2880
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,320
Is still not in play

2881
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:42,368
And I do not know how he hasn't gotten

2882
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,672
And so I'm going to

2883
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,536
Continuing down this road in 2013

2884
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,584
Did I do I don't know why

2885
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,144
If it seemed to me that he hasn't brought up yet

2886
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,936
I'm just going to keep that there is a

2887
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,032
I will see when Alex finally does bring it up.

2888
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:02,848
But I will get to that and then episode Down
