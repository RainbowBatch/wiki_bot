1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Galaxy color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Jordan

3
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,088
A hook I think so

4
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Make it things

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,488
Absolutely

6
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,864
Enola

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Yes

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah I'm in rough shape

9
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
Hangover at all I've done so much damage

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
To myself over the years

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
Complete disaster

12
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
I made a mistake we went out last night you and I

13
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
Pick your guys at

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
For sure

15
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
The celebrating

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
It so after we split ways

17
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
Hung out with my roommates

18
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
They watched dumb

19
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Videos

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
Videos of

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Alright

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
Mozart

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
But I love a dunk

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Everybody loves

25
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
The huge basketball fan when I was younger

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
Hearken back to younger time

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
But John Starks

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Dominique Wilkins

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,976
One of those guys is not

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,912
Jordan is Big dunker

31
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
Santa videos

32
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Still strange to hear you say

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Videos

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
I am here to make a

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
Are you serious report

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
The world needs to know about

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
So the 1991 dunk contest

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
All right there we go now it's again

39
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Now is this the one

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
Was this the one where Jordan left from the free throw line

41
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
No I believe that was like

42
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,728
That was 8988

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
It's irrelevant

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
1990 basketball

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
1991

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Was the year that the

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
The finals in the dunk contest where Shawn Kemp Indy Brown

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
Disappointing Dunk Contest final

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
Dee Brown ends up winning by putting his importer of his elbow

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
It's fantastic

51
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Dee Brown

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Subpar

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
To begin with

54
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Look as much as I love a good Shawn Kemp

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Not his Forte

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
This

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
The entirety of all

58
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,992
From the 1991 Dunk Contest are available on YouTube to go find them

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
And we will give you all of the 91.

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Contest

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Where is Showbox

62
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Conspiracies

63
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,192
But by and large

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Rex Chapman

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
From the Charlotte Hornets okay

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Was nasty

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Beyond those junk

68
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Sick

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
He pitched the ball to himself from behind the back of

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
Over-the-shoulder caught it.

71
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
It was in it was Madness what Rex Chapman

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,488
Didn't make the finals Charlotte Hornets kind of situation

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
Enfranchise absolute I believe that

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,800
Crew cut it white guy felt like

75
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Shawn Kemp's going to win this thing with brick D Brown in for novelty cuz he's tiny I don't know

76
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
I think the fix was in

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Was a menace on the

78
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Throw this out there

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
An anti-white narrative

80
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
I already stopped

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
All right look

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,431
Noah's race necessarily comes into it I'm not a hundred percent making that argument but I am saying

83
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
I'm saying that there was something going on

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
It was not in Rex Chapman

85
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Make sense cuz if you look at those dunks

86
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
On paper

87
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Let me tell you something

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Stern

89
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Stern would never allow a white dude into the Donkey

90
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
It said can't have detlef schrempf

91
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
Shrimp

92
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
He could.

93
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Undoubtedly

94
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
You get that off my chest 91

95
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Only and laptop

96
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
I was surprised

97
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Alright

98
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Memphis he remember that do

99
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Rick's chip is it out of nowhere Buster

100
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Gravy dunk

101
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,495
All I was sleeping on Rex Chapman

102
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
Rex Chapman was a great dunker is like saying Christian Laettner was

103
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
The Dream Team

104
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Like that is not

105
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Basketball game

106
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
I know a lot

107
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
On the Charlotte Hornets

108
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
Brent and a grandma Ma

109
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Music

110
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
See now we need Alex Jones clips of him talking about basket

111
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,439
If Rex Chapman ever goes on Kerry Cassidy

112
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
That's the most important thing we're going to ever do

113
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
I didn't want to talk about Alex Jones

114
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,191
Are we doing we've got a Project Camelot episode

115
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
Video of the week here on now on your Monday episode

116
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,663
So I give a shout-out to one of our listeners

117
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Nia Long

118
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Do this episode of project

119
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
I don't watch it all the

120
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
God

121
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
She did because

122
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Holyshit

123
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Alright

124
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,303
Going on tonight at 8

125
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Right now

126
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
But also

127
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Before we do that

128
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
It's important for me to

129
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Weave reference

130
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
What's this

131
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,663
Kerry Cassidy

132
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,735
It's a bit of an anti-semite

133
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
This is brought to my attention by

134
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,111
Keegan and I appreciate him dropping that along

135
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Here's a clip to back that up

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
This is Robert David

137
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Feel on

138
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Rather than

139
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,055
And I distinguish between anti-zionism

140
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
An anti-Semitism which is absolutely despicable

141
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
And under no circumstances

142
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
We have 9 million loyalty Cinemark

143
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
America in every single one of them

144
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Patriots

145
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
And not part of the problem

146
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Okay

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Well that's quite a blanket

148
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
Statement

149
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,679
Because of your enthusiasm for you know the

150
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
The Jewish race call it what you will

151
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Sign is

152
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
I won't go into it now

153
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Anti-semitism

154
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
There's nothing defensible there

155
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
It's not egregious

156
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Horrific

157
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Just yet

158
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
It's

159
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:49,663
You are not wrong

160
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,527
There are nine million loyal Jews America

161
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
And she was like

162
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
And that's not a good that's not a good response to that

163
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
She just be like

164
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Great

165
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,583
Even like now I think it's more like 8.5

166
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Do you know a lot of

167
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
People are losing religion these days

168
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
All because of REM

169
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
Salute

170
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Robert David

171
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Steel

172
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
Says

173
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Cassidy

174
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
I will

175
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
Oh no I read it it says feel the Holocaust

176
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Zionism an AP

177
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Guilt by association

178
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Are you saying

179
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
That Zionism

180
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
And a pack

181
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
In his eyes

182
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Are guilty of the

183
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,103
Pushback for how I answer that question about the Holocaust

184
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
He's referencing here he's asked about the Holocaust

185
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Responded

186
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,087
Not great

187
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Both praise and push back for how I answered

188
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Mystify the Holocaust

189
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
What's the carefully distinguish between

190
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
How much is everybody

191
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Is Duty reprehensible

192
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Had to put an end to the

193
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
American Israel public affairs committee aipac

194
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
An agent of a foreign power by definition

195
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Another term has on Congress

196
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Here's my personal take

197
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
On both the history and the

198
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
The present

199
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Bullet point one

200
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
The Holocaust happen

201
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Great

202
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
I'm sure that immediately following that

203
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
He says

204
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,743
And everything that we learn from history is accurate and perhaps

205
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Maybe

206
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Racism towards the Jews is not a good idea

207
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
Millions died however there are several

208
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Celebrate

209
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
To be challenged

210
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
A boy

211
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
Those who died did not die from gas

212
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
This includes those in prison camps most of

213
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Starvation

214
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Typhus

215
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Although

216
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
People did die for

217
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
I feel like

218
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,743
I don't need to beg a little bit how it was just

219
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,143
Killed most of them in the

220
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
It's not accurate

221
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
A lot of other disrespectful

222
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,503
Okay Barbie and the Roma people were also

223
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
Targeted for extermination

224
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
But Hitler's Army and ideology

225
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
But this is

226
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Business

227
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
He's in our like right in front of us

228
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
Have happened in the world

229
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,951
Good point that's a whataboutism I'm not I'm not a fan of it

230
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
The owner other Jenna

231
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Besides in mass murders

232
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
Is itself despicable

233
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,335
Genocide of the Native Americans

234
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Drew

235
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
It said by some to

236
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
The Jews

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
No one's hands are clean in this matter

238
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Fair enough

239
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Right I mean many of the

240
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
The story has been told

241
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
Many of the ideas

242
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
That Hitler originally

243
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,679
Surprise by America

244
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
America caused the Holocaust

245
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
That's a very different

246
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
America

247
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Did their own

248
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,319
Yeah he goes on to talk about our scientists are responsible

249
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
4 people dying in

250
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
The Holocaust

251
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
That's not

252
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Did not have to die

253
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
Ultimately was responsible for the suffering of the Jew

254
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Jews in labor

255
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
It was the elites Zionist Jews themselves

256
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,991
This goes back to the narrative that they didn't pay everybody out

257
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Now we're into

258
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
You're on the list by friend

259
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
Hey I'm at the separation of the Jewish race from the palace

260
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
Is a distortion of reality

261
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Scale

262
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
Look I am in summer

263
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
They supported Trump they're not great

264
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Who is the monster

265
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
He is a f****** horrific human being

266
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Israel is an AR parts

267
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
These are true things

268
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
But also

269
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Let's leave the Holocaust out of disgust

270
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
Sing those things let it inform Wyatt

271
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Relations with Israel

272
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,959
And maybe reducing it to Zionism versus anti-zionism

273
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Is not the way to go

274
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Look

275
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
What I'm saying

276
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Good steel is

277
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
Lacoste minimizer

278
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Anyways

279
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Absolutely

280
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
You do

281
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Who are in the camp

282
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Swing together

283
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
Further evidence that we've got some

284
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Problems

285
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Lexi

286
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
She's not there

287
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Spider

288
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
It's concerning that there are those

289
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
There's so many of those people

290
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Who

291
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Almost

292
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Like gateways

293
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
Is harder antisemita

294
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
Everybody's responsibility

295
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
And it's a very short

296
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Senor like

297
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Yeah yeah yeah

298
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Oh boy

299
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Why I think

300
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Robert Davi

301
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Steel may have been

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
The Dukes show

303
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,639
So anyway

304
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Way to bring us down in the in the

305
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
Forefront of a Project Camelot

306
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,903
Most of our time in Project Camelot

307
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
I looking at

308
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
How stupid

309
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Believing the lies of

310
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
Murder accessory Mark Richards

311
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,471
About savvy

312
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
I feel like we've also learned

313
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
The people were fighting

314
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
Spiders or something like that

315
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Spider leadership

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Yeah the spider leadership was in effect

317
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,063
Of course video

318
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Sit down

319
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
I just breaking down the news baby she's just breaking down

320
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Regular

321
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,351
And this came out about a week ago or so

322
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Take a note

323
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Is not good

324
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Let's just jump in how she begins with a

325
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,407
Project Camelot and well I've got a

326
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Strange

327
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
John today

328
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
Anyway I wake up every morning

329
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Can feel a strange going on right now

330
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,767
If you ever refer to things as goings-on

331
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
It's the same thing with like bedfellows

332
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
You never said strip

333
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
Strange fellows

334
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Perhaps

335
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
Because you're so bad at Scrabble and I'm awesome

336
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Alright

337
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
But I told you last night I never lose twice

338
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,791
Game theory behind how you will never lose to me again

339
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
Alright

340
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Okay alright

341
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
I was going to be having a conversation with

342
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Robert David Steele

343
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,199
Initiated it with me however then found out

344
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,063
He is not supposed to cover anything to do with space

345
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,159
Obviously

346
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Things in space

347
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Space

348
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
He is not going to be able to join us after all

349
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
I'm here on my own

350
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,239
Yeah

351
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
If you consider we're in space right now

352
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,199
Robert

353
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Kodak

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Jewelry

355
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Atmosphere

356
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,399
We supposed to be there

357
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Clearance

358
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
To talk about these things

359
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Robert David Steele

360
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Pretending that they have handlers

361
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,015
And if they work for the CIA had it like that

362
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
To get into a narrative

363
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
I assumed

364
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
This is what they're doing is like

365
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
I don't want to talk more about these bars Bass

366
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
People are clowning on me

367
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
I don't want to do it

368
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Zoe pretend

369
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
The higher-ups have said

370
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
You got it

371
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Too hot

372
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Can't talk about that

373
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
I will put forth by

374
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Possibility though

375
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
Please don't let your possibility

376
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Actually working today

377
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,895
Rihanna is a limited hangout okay

378
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
I got to cancel I got another thing and Carrie has to

379
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Robert canceled because it has

380
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
To be a conspiracy so it's

381
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
He's not allowed to come on the show

382
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Right yeah that's possible you could pick up

383
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,047
The kids from soccer

384
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Didn't let in my office

385
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
James

386
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
He's not in studio

387
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
We do get a celebrity appearance

388
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
Actual celebrity.

389
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
To start off with

390
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Obviously there's been a recent

391
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
Disclosure Announcement by Tom DeLonge

392
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839
And for those of you who know you're with that news I suggest you just

393
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Last name he's a member of

394
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
I think a band

395
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
And

396
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
The band is called

397
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
Blink-182 jumpstart mailman

398
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,599
The quote that one of their contemporaries

399
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,927
I was close but no cigar

400
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
Blink-182

401
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
I know but it's

402
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Still somehow funny it is funny

403
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Especially

404
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Talking about aliens in space

405
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
4 years

406
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
I missed it for a very long time

407
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,383
Not authorized to talk about it

408
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
Those are not authorized to talk about growing up anymore I absolutely.

409
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
I think they're not around anymore

410
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Who cares

411
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
They shouldn't have been around

412
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
Disclosure

413
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
I need trying to

414
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
To get alien

415
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Truce

416
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Pushed out

417
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
A Blink-182 dude is like

418
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Tom DeLonge

419
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
So I am calling upon

420
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
Right to release

421
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Alien ship

422
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,152
He started to work with some people

423
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
She thinks they're very credible

424
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
And I have news for her

425
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
They're not

426
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
And I don't know the music

427
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
So I apologize for that

428
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
He has gotten very involved in this whole disclosure story and so he is

429
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Pharrell

430
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,960
Standing up with a couple of

431
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Well

432
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Get ready for one of my favorite names

433
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,128
That I have ever heard on this show

434
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
With several

435
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
Sort of Heavy Hitters you might say

436
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,112
And they're doing something called to the stars in this is an organization he's starting

437
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
What's going on on the planet

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
To do with

439
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
Developing free energy

440
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Really I would say is

441
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
An illustrious

442
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Scientist

443
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
2 is

444
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
Hold on one second cuz I've got a whole list of

445
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Stuff here for

446
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
Or who's involved

447
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,048
It's helped Rudolph is one of the main people involved and I I don't apologize minute

448
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,376
Have to be searching around live talking here because of God

449
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
Information in a lot of different places

450
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
There's a gym semi vanhoose come forward and has supposedly been working for the CIA

451
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
Although damn Smith

452
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,248
A person who is

453
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Somewhat read into some degree on the secret space program

454
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Is it contested whether or not Jim semivan isn't who he says he is

455
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Mr Porter

456
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
This supports the theory of nominative

457
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,016
Determinism

458
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
Look you got to live with that

459
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,416
Secret agent name

460
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,280
My mom was there an autobus

461
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,888
Weather need to go

462
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Delightful

463
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
This is good as Rex

464
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Chapman

465
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Quite frankly

466
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Sammy van my ass

467
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Jim's

468
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
She's working

469
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
With Tom DeLonge also

470
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
Bite me

471
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
Chirp chirp

472
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Yes

473
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,384
Already already we discovered

474
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
I love the narrative

475
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
I love it

476
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
I take it another day

477
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:01,440
Together a super team of scientists

478
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Might be an imposter

479
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Absolutely

480
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
I love it

481
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,496
Real facts nothing is more of a Raptor name

482
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,104
They could be they could take the really good lyrics

483
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
Also she mentioned that

484
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,528
Plague

485
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
So do you want to know about him

486
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Yes I do

487
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
He isn't

488
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
PhD in electrical

489
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Engineering

490
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Realty

491
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
Or like a Saigon

492
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Everything I can tell he's a real PhD

493
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
I don't know I didn't call this

494
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,056
So he got involved in like

495
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Some weird s***

496
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Throughout his life

497
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
His credibility is

498
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
Is a little credit

499
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
Nitrate

500
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
He was part of this

501
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
And the DIA funded

502
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Program

503
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
That we're trying to

504
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
Investigate paranormal

505
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
Ability

506
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,656
So they did a study on people like URI Geller

507
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Including URI Geller

508
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Subway

509
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Really bent

510
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,872
Well it's Rudolph and Russell targ

511
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Who was his authority

512
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
They became king

513
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Keller I had genuine psychic powers

514
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
However

515
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Sleight of hand

516
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Was working

517
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
For the CIA

518
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
What are you doing magic

519
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
He's doing close-up Magic

520
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
So he's a dumb

521
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
He's a dumb guy

522
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Is trying to work

523
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,224
Jordan's most people believe at least at this point is pseudoscience

524
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,808
Courseview stuff that's being explored

525
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,488
Zero Point Energy electromagnetic field low-energy nuclear reactions

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
Working on all this stuff

527
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
With his company called Earth Tech International

528
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Soap

529
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,616
Earthtech were granted US patent 5845000

530
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
M220

531
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Odel-ay

532
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
The case of getting him

533
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
This patent

534
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Even though what he's

535
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
It's not real

536
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
The cases used for educational purposes

537
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Patent law

538
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
As an example of a valid path

539
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Where quote

540
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
The lesson of the pooch off Pat

541
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
Is it a world where both types

542
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Two patents are more and more common

543
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,800
Even a competent examiner may fail to distinguish innovation

544
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Pseudoscience

545
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Cakes

546
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Let's go

547
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
Write as an example of

548
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,624
Everybody's full of s*** but you can call it

549
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
That whatever

550
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
So

551
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
Doesn't mean that you act

552
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Actually have to do anything

553
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
You can patent

554
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Like

555
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
The thought of

556
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Have a good day

557
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,192
Right

558
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,520
For the CIA that the URI Geller was legit

559
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
Patent

560
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Bulshit patent

561
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
In educational

562
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
Stop

563
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
Beetle

564
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
Magical engineering just do any electrical engineering

565
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
I think you did for a bit

566
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
Here he worked with and invented

567
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Turnable lasers and electron

568
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Devices in

569
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Yeah

570
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
Do those actually work or they are they magic to

571
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
I don't know

572
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
So we're talking about

573
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
Character who can make something really cool also

574
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
Sex Magic

575
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
Right right but I think his version of crazy as a little worse

576
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
Generally speaking

577
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:21,536
Jack Parsons gay

578
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096

580
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Yeah

I love the players

582
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
We got

583
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
The lead singer of Blink-182

584
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Gym Sunnyvale

585
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552
Help Rudolph who is a disaster and also not about a real person

586
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
We also have been in Blink-182

587
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Is Mark Hoppus in disguise

588
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
Unclear

589
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
I'm so

590
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
It is the good news is

591
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,376
And her life

592
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,728
Kerry Cassidy is a little bit suspicious

593
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
For the first time ever and I think it's because she's

594
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,040
He's getting a lot of attention but she's not knows all the truth

595
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Reggie

596
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
Singer of the band coming in

597
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,720
Brett come lately I've been studying nonsense

598
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,840
Maybe she does know who Blink-182

599
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
I don't know

600
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
Yeah even knows who those guys are

601
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
She start singing All the Small Things

602
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,312
Elaine outside her feeling

603
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
They're choosing one

604
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
UFO encounter at

605
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
And pretending

606
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,624
This is an unidentified flying object

607
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
Can I have to tell you that the secret space program

608
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
And as a result the people that are on this panel I have to give them credit to pee at least knowledgeable

609
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
About the speaker

610
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
Space program and I can tell you that they know

611
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
Exactly

612
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
Most likely

613
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
What kind of crafts

614
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Where it comes from

615
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:16,224
So it's not really a UFO it's not really an unidentified

616
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
Aerial threat

617
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
Alessandro

618
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,136
Jasmine Elizondo

619
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Is the security guy

620
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
Exclaiming on that video

621
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,704
It's unfortunate but you have a disclosure with lies

622
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Interesting

623
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
I don't know how to deal with

624
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
I don't know how to deal with Carrie

625
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Saying that somebody is lying

626
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,504
I can understand

627
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
Sent

628
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
Bullet journals

629
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,584
That's good so confusing to me because like

630
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
You're able

631
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
To think that something's Ally

632
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
Hi

633
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,080
How how do you not exercising your brain when you go to the prison

634
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Who is hangs out with Raptors

635
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
Crazy

636
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Everybody has blind-spot

637
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,832
Everything is a blind spot for her

638
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
In the world of music as well

639
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,280
I'll be honest though like I do think that it's right

640
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
To question everything

641
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
Gym Sunnyvale

642
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,984
Murderer is fine brightright

643
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
31

644
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Boy

645
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
I don't know how to tell you

646
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Kerry Cassidy

647
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Edit

648
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
This clip is just a a deterioration

649
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Of literacy

650
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
So what is my premise here

651
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
This is

652
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
That all of them

653
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,816
Every single thing you're hearing all the false Flags

654
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Fires in Northern California

655
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Las Vegas happening

656
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
You name it

657
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
All is the results

658
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Body itching

659
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
Who are now coming forward I believe

660
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:25,760
And not just one race although the evidence I have is only about One race which is the ref

661
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Richards

662
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
The bottom line is that if you

663
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,816
Look at the news and you do not consider the ET side of it you do not consider that are

664
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Military

665
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
Is at war with various teaching races

666
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Has been

667
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
Sometime in the rain

668
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,688
The testimony of William Tompkins he will see very quickly

669
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Workhorse

670
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
Aspirus from aldebaran

671
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,368
Reptilians as well

672
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Who were helping

673
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
At least at the time of William Tompkins

674
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,400
She's really not giving mammals much credit it's always reptile

675
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:22,080
Erase of extraterrestrial marsupials

676
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
Don't forget some Alex Jones in here

677
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Spiders

678
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
That's great

679
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
Vietnam

680
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Is it just because we

681
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
Mammal to be cute

682
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Yes

683
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
Is that why they can't

684
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,888
A hundred percent absolutely there's been a distrust

685
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
An uneasy truce

686
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
Personify all these like really scary things as

687
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
Blizzardy I mean

688
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
There's a lizard eat next to him

689
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Pennywise

690
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
He looks a little cute

691
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
You're a cutie

692
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
If you did not work picking up all the

693
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Jesus bear

694
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:14,048
What is that the fires in California

695
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Are part of alien

696
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Also Volkswagen

697
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah

698
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
Something-or-other

699
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
A little confused perhaps

700
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
CI because later she

701
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
Cheap T-shirts switches up what you

702
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Actually like

703
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,136
Alright but now it's like their fault

704
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Aliens are pushed

705
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
For disclosure

706
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
Cuz we won't do it and there's multiple races but she only knows about one knows about the one

707
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
We have established

708
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,080
That Richards is an unreliable narrator

709
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Are the good guy

710
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,480
In theory I'm not ready to go that far

711
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Prevalence

712
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
But anyways

713
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
Contribution to the secret space

714
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
Aerospace program Syracuse

715
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Aerospace

716
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Oh I wanted to say that

717
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,520
Canva little bit and I don't I don't know enough about him I don't know

718
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,336
To do a deep dive on it but

719
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,688
Looking at him and some of these other people who come into our sphere

720
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Because of Project Camelot

721
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
It turns out

722
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
It's much

723
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Easier than you think

724
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
To say bulshit in front of Congress

725
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
It turns out Vicky

726
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:50,816
Congressional Record is full of people like VIP

727
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Being races from Draco

728
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:57,216
Helps control

729
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
Exact

730
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
It's not space weapon

731
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Climate change

732
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,152
Making everything really dry in California

733
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Other

734
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,832
NASA Apollo Landing

735
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Cetera

736
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
Don't even back in those days we were being helped by teens

737
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
That means

738
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
When I say in Chinese

739
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Races.

740
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Some of which may reside

741
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Inside the Earth

742
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
And some maybe an underground

743
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Faces

744
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,968
Some of those things may consider Earth their home

745
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,368
Or I can then of course the wind staff on out to the various Galaxy come from

746
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
Galaxy Quest

747
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,304
And of course

748
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Chilean

749
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
Hybrid

750
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
And they are causing

751
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Great deal of problems

752
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Here on Earth

753
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
And they of course we're backing the Nazis back in the day

754
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
Yeah

755
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,504
Reptile chimeras

756
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,136
Are hybrids

757
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
But it's similar their similarities to the narratives that we see

758
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
You know Alex

759
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
I've had David icon that's David Icke

760
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
To a T

761
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
There is much more overlap it's probably would like

762
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
If he watched if he wants her show

763
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
And actually listen to it and was like

764
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,992
I think she's onto something I think you have to be like

765
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
She was alone

766
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,952
Before we go any further

767
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
Carrie cast

768
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
How do we feel about ghosts

769
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
Feel better how do I feel about it

770
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
Did she ever talk about

771
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,552
Or is she like hard sci-fi and ghost

772
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,880
Let me tell you

773
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
Knowing literally nothing

774
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
Yeah

775

Behind the scenes

795
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Understandably

796
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,352
To the Stars this organization started again by Tom DeLonge

797
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,680

798
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Do the rabbits

799
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
Complexcon

800
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
The disclosure

801
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
But he's trying to push

802
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
Aliens

803
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
You just keep screaming about aliens

804
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
It's bigger priority for it's like me doing stand-up

Cuz they got to the other members of Blink-182

810
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
The girl at the rock show

811
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
Take off your pants and jacket

812
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Raptors don't wear jackets

813
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
You know what else

814
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,536

Stupid

00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,567
If his next Clipper we get today

821
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:28,479
This isn't part of necessity one imagines because I don't think they will have the blessing of

822
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Car stop

823
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
That means that they've got the Illuminati side

824
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
The side that is run by a probably

825
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Predominantly statement

826
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
The other side of which may be considered as the bush cabal or Rockefeller

827
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887

Space program is orchestrated in large part

835
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,975
Individual

836
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
So Satanist okay

837
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
This is Alex Jones

839
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Globalist

840
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
Three-quarters of the way there

841
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Little do you know why

842
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
I will explain

843
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Exactly why

844
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663

Cuz he's worried about that

848
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
Are you can be worried about sickness without actually believing cannot can I ask you to put a pin in that question for a couple clips

849
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
Because I think I did actually I might be able to answer that

00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
Belize

851
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
As a very literal be

852
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,359
I feel like Harry would have to go space with

853
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,663
They say

854
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
Literally fell from the heavens

855
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271

With The Reptilian agenda

861
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,423

As I say

871
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
The agenda of the sickness

872
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Coincide

873
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
Say Nazi side of things

874
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103

00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
This is Alex Jones ship

876
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199

878
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807

881
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,351
And it seems very similar way

882
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Is all archaic

883
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
December 10th

884
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
It's bloodline

885
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,823
Big butt that's why Kerry Cassidy

886
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
Appear on

887
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
On paper

888
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
To be very

889
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
She is exposing

890
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
Secret space program

891
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,367
Spider leadership and what-have-you right Alex Jones

War against white dude

893
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
And we got to stand up for our virility

894
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
And the reason they can come together

895
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,839
Because the villains that they've chosen

896
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:00,191
In the case of Kerry Cassidy it's reptoids and all that

897
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,567
Define characteristics

898
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
And their motivation

899
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Are based

900
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
Archaic anti-semitism

901
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
That is all

902
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,295
Old-timer

903
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Demonizing slaughtered

00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,951
Super cool with having some Allegra

905
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,279
So if there are people out there who don't know

906
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:30,143
Further proof that the reptoids are actually the good guys because in real life

907
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,983
Are the good guys

908
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Let's be cool

909
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
So if you guys out there don't know what blood libel is

910
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,455
You are living in a

911
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,831
Medieval England with the death of William of Norwich

912
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,879
William was a twelve-year-old Tanner the

913
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
Guess who's killed in 1144

914
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951

00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Of his death

916
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
The parents accused the local Jewish community

917
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Responsibility

918
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
But investigation

919
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Convert field

920
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
6 years later

921
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Thomas of Monmouth

922
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
A Benedictine Monk

923
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Decided to investigate

924
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Sensationalize the murder

925
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,311
Leon anti-Semitic

926
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Sensationalism

927
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
He wrote A martyrdom account

928
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175

00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,015
Hey Richie said the local Jews acting is a part of the internet

930
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
An international

931
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Conspiracy

932
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
Crucified the young boy is part of a ritual to reclaim

933
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
Control of the Holy

934
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415

To the boy's grave and laid the foundations

940
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
For the bloodline

941
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,191
Similar stories crop up throughout Europe in the Middle Ages

942
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,007
A company by episodes of violent retaliation towards

943
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
Jews

944
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Illegal trials about

945
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Especially during the Crusades

946
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
Stories were used to justify progress

947
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
In the case of the disappearing

948
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,527
Year-old Simon of Trent

949
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551

15 men burned

953
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,439
Mistake after being forced

954
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,719
To confess under torture

955
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Until tonight

956
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,303
65 Simon of Trent was regarded as a

957
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583

Throughout history

959
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
Great-great-grandson of Simon of Trent

960
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,615
History the specifics of the blood libel varied and expand

961
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,711
It primarily involve the baking of Christian blood in Passover matzah

962
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,527

963
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087

967
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
From circumcision

968
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
It should go without saying that these lurid stories and older manifestation

969
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Are patently on

970
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
True ohyeah

971
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,703
So is it is important there is

972
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239
This is all this stuff

973
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
The calyx does it on his show

974
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Carrie does it on her show

975
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
The ideas

976
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Evil forces

977
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Maybe we want to drink their blood

978
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,319
All that's what I said use them in rituals

979
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,927
All dates back to this blood libel

980
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,279
Mob mentality cuz it's it's very it's very

981
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,583
It's effective

982
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
It's an attractive proposition to

983
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Every

984
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
A group

985
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
Yeah because then

986
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,383
Then you have a very clear-cut enemy and once you defeat that animates

987
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
All of your problems go away

988
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,479
How many problems you have

989
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,783
You never have to actually deal with the

990
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
Probably just blame them on somebody else

991
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,183
Yeah a personal responsibility that is mine

992
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
From

993
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Another

994
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
The point about that

995
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
These accusations

996
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Affected

997
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
Strike at the heart of society

998
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,167
These fears about outsider

999
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
Yeah

1000
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
The destruction

1001
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
To the public research

1002
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Wells

1003
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,823
The presence of

1004
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Secret organizations

1005
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Ascites

1006
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,431
So the other things are that we bring in

1007
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,551
Format

1008
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Archaic anti-semitism

1009
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,695
I mean who knows if we can find a great example of Kerry Cassidy doing

1010
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,535
Better than the fluoride in the water narrative no

1011
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,839
ADI global

1012
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
Fluoride in the water is one

1013
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
100% the grandchild

1014
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,519
Much like Jim semi van around

1015
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Poison well

1016
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
In order to kill Christian

1017
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
It's completely in nonsensical

1018
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
And Alex bases all of it on

1019
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Harvard study

1020
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
Video always goes back to

1021
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
Harvard study that came out

1022
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,647
Dropsy

1023
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
I did a little bit looking into

1024
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
This was a 2012

1025
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Study of study

1026
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
Their works

1027
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Couple researchers

1028
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
At Harvard

1029
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:50,239
They compiled 27 studies that had already been done

1030
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
About fluoride

1031
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
But they were all from

1032
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
China

1033
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
All the studies were from China

1034
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,711
That's not to say there's anything wrong with China

1035
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,831
To say that the rates at which they have fluoride

1036
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
Very different than America

1037
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,927
People who did the study

1038
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:15,327
Came out and said this is not applicable in America has nothing to do with the

1039
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Water

1040
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Fluoridation here

1041
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
And in fact everybody at Harvard

1042
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
Every professor of

1043
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
History and all that s***

1044
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
All of them came out and said that they saw

1045
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,407
Water fluoridation

1046
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Fred

1047
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,503
The meta-analysis of all of these studies

1048
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,295
And then they were like hey

1049
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,903
America has the right level of fluoride in their water

1050
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,023
Don't go too far with Flora is a scientific reality that if you have

1051
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
Too much

1052
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
If you have a credit card to buy belt buckles

1053
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,215
Is there a water is probably not going to go well for also

1054
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Their paper

1055
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
All the time

1056
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
This passage

1057
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,943
Each of these articles reviewed at deficiency

1058
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
In some cases

1059
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Limitless

1060
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
Conclusion that can be drawn

1061
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
That's in the paper that Alex's

1062
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Was trying to say

1063
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,791
Disapprove

1064
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
Archaic anti-semitism

1065
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,007
He's so swing by the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1066
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Cassidy

1067
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
Sick and tired of these goddamn anti-semite

1068
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
Why

1069
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
Everywhere

1070
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:40,319
What else do we got to do it so it's so frustrating because again

1071
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
You go back 100 years ago back to the Medieval ages and you hear the same dumb s*** that you do now

1072
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
That's what I'm saying

1073
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,607
That's what I'm saying if you guys want to

1074
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,167
It's up some stuff

1075
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
F****** get created

1076
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
Giving Infowars advice

1077
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,639
Switch it up baby

1078
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,479
Don't do this blood libel poisoning the well just come up with something new

1079
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
I don't know how you would

1080
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,879
Betty White

1081
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,511
Security Cassidy and Alex Jones both live in the same arcade

1082
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
Semitism well and they refused to get out of it

1083
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
I think has

1084
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,911
Something fun

1085
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
There are other races

1086
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Such as

1087
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
Let's see if

1088
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,991
You would say the Mantis beings are mantids also there are

1089
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
7 Dragon Ball

1090
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,647
Has come to the fore a lot of races

1091
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,231
Even unknown and I would say that's true

1092
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,119
Space program as well not sure what that sentence means

1093
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Minted

1094
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
We got Dragon Ball

1095
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Cuz

1096
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
I got to be honest

1097
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
That's my favorite thing ever

1098
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
What's it what's a dragon

1099
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
Is the dragon monster real

1100
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
I mean what do you think

1101
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
To be as aggressive

1102
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
What the f*** you think if they're real

1103
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,951
Why can't no I mean we have we have mantises

1104
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:29,887
Romanticism extraterrestrial mantis

1105
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
It could be a regular thing

1106
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,383
You mean like maybe just like

1107
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,759
Play coming to us from outage

1108
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
Dragon Ball Z

1109
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,855
Very well bye. I don't know

1110
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,439
But I looked you appreciate her heard trick

1111
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
As opposed to Alex

1112
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
She does not provide

1113
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,559
Over over example

1114
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,839
Both know she goes

1115
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Mantids

1116
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Dragon moth

1117
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
Etc

1118
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
You got it

1119
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
You got the game after that

1120
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
What else is there to say

1121
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
What you get mansion

1122
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
And Dragon Ball Z

1123
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,503
The whole game is upright we already have spiders

1124
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,087
Mantis creatures

1125
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,951
Get create

1126
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
Right

1127
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,583
Evil

1128
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Erase

1129
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,375
Like button

1130
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,447
Play crystallize later like maybe the entire Earth

1131
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,775
The Earth velour still on bugs bro

1132
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Is actually

1133
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Caterpillars

1134
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
I'd eventually Earth will explode

1135
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
Not because of human intervention

1136
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Climate change

1137
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
But because

1138
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
The dragon boss finally over

1139
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
The climate change

1140
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Nothing is actually

1141
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:00,255
I'm trying to get out of that slump

1142
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,631
Moth alien

1143
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
And what I can learn about

1144
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,751
Marysville

1145
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:16,895
Versions of Godzilla versus Mothra

1146
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,967
Pharoahe Monch song Saima

1147
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
Says

1148
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Play Godzilla verse

1149
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
Vs Mothra theme song

1150
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,087
Very

1151
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
Aggressive

1152
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
It's been there since

1153
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,119
The beginning I got to do a big fight about

1154
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
A couple people have said in the past

1155
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Just

1156
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Godzilla March

1157
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
Specifically the 14-month

1158
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
And I do know that for a fact

1159
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Everyone

1160
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Go fly a moth shaped

1161
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
A dragon

1162
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
I respect

1163
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
That

1164
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,087
I'm a little bit worried that you've gotten into multiple sites

1165
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:02,463
Probably with the same person memories a little hasty

1166
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,351
I can't cuz I'm right I will not let go of any Pharoahe Monch or wreck

1167
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
What's the temperature

1168
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:14,751
Cyclopedia of alien race

1169
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
Good

1170
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,639
Okay so there's a there's a

1171
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
That's all

1172
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
You know there's a

1173
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
People are going on

1174
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,039
Call Olga Hog Wild about there being a moth

1175
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Chicago

1176
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
So that's hot

1177
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,903
That's a Hot Topic there we go

1178
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,719
So other than mine are largely subbed

1179
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Geranium

1180
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
Pterodactyl like humans

1181
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
Like wings

1182
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,911
Some shows are not really related to Mott's at all

1183
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Sometimes

1184
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
Describe dispossessing horns

1185
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
The dusk

1186
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,799
Considered very similar to the traditional depicts

1187
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
The devil

1188
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
According to

1189
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,127
Certain individuals with encounter

1190
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
Although I was referred to as Mothman

1191
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
Might be a little missile

1192
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Also

1193
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
Mothman Ark

1194
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Considered

1195
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Draco alien

1196
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:08,511
The leader is the reptilians are the Draco

1197
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
They

1198
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,071
I even have special wings

1199
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Flaps of skin

1200
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
Supported by long ribs

1201
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,935
These can be folded back against the body

1202
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,983
They're also known as the dragon race

1203
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,127
And their symbology usually they're also known as the Mothman

1204
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Soldier class

1205
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
Of the species and the quote

1206
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
I a

1207
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
So

1208
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,367
Look at the dragon boss

1209
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
Is fun

1210
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,999
She's really just describing draco's as a different name

1211
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
Talks about draco's that's not new

1212
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Exciting

1213
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Based on the fact that they're in

1214
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
Chicago might be real

1215
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
Might be real

1216
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
That's possible and this might be what she

1217
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
Thanks a bunch

1218
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
Of the devil

1219
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
Cuz they're awesome

1220
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,199
Describe

1221
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,735
Alright so sickness

1222
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Don't worry

1223
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,831
Satan

1224
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
The Draco Dragon Ball super

1225
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Oh boy

1226
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,607
But in his next clip carry list off a bunch of fakes

1227
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Technologies that she has

1228
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Uncovered

1229
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,007
The ability to tap into things

1230
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
Innocence is being talked about things like

1231
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,455
Certain

1232
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,783
Zero Point Energy

1233
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
So

1234
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,111
There is so much out there

1235
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
Call disease

1236
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
Capriccio

1237
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:47,327
This is Randy Cramer

1238
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
So

1239
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
It's an endless

1240
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,431
Secret space program

1241
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
In almost no time of paying

1242
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Mention to her

1243
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,599
We have been able to figure out where these narratives come from

1244
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
Trackdown the sources of them

1245
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
And find out how bogus they are

1246
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:18,047
Between like in Cliff's you talking about how boot off earlier this episode

1247
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,119
And Randy Cramer

1248
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,911
But he still has a GoFundMe up for

1249
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,239
When are we going to get into gym minivan

1250
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,567
That's alright that's our headliner

1251
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Do minivan

1252
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
No longer employed

1253
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,967
I don't know you real

1254
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,807
What are Perry Cassidy is ripe

1255
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
Well I could borrow one

1256
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Carrie gets it right

1257
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
I found it I found like a

1258
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,999
Google and look for Jim minivan

1259
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Can find if you wrote a forward to a book

1260
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
Reclaimed wood works

1261
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
For the CIA for

1262
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
25

1263
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,983
All right I don't know anything about the

1264
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,543
And I have no idea

1265
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,943
That supports his claim that he works for the CIA but I have him hang out with Jim photoglo

1266
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,991
Musician to photoglo

1267
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,063
Hey Jim.

1268
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
The gym

1269
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,415
How many people work for the secret space program

1270
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,463
Their infrastructure must

1271
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,767
It's got to be

1272
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,559
They're doing everything

1273
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,607
The everything

1274
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:30,495
Complex work any of them how is it that it hasn't gotten out like there has to be home

1275
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,567
Recipe whole planned communities built around the secret

1276
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
Space Program I think our next episode is probably going to be about Andrew basiago

1277
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
The Project Camelot

1278
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
I was I was

1279
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
Listening to a lecture that he gave the other day

1280
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
And it's f******

1281
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Wild stuff

1282
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
He's

1283
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
Origin story

1284
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
Is that when he was a kid

1285
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
His dad

1286
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,071
Who may or may not have been a little bit of a booze guy

1287
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,375
He showed him

1288
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
A paper

1289
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,679
You right

1290
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
This info

1291
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
40 years

1292
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,287
It came back in time you might you have to

1293
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Study this

1294
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
In order for him to write it

1295
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
In the future

1296
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
Call Lisa

1297
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
I meant to get the time traveling with Barack Obama

1298
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Back with his name

1299
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
It's great

1300
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Alright everybody

1301
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,183
He's a lot of fun

1302
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,719
I'm in so

1303
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Anyway

1304
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
What was the point

1305
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,863
I think it's dead

1306
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,167
Bitlife that

1307
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
MetroPointe energy

1308
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
I liked

1309
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
2 described as

1310
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
Provided

1311
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,783
You can just have like some water like right here on the table

1312
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
And it Powers every

1313
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
Right okay

1314
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
Yeah she's into

1315
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Conspiracy

1316
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,823
Explain the whole Japanese whaling 100% are absolutely

1317
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,639
Raptors

1318
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
They're too cute totally

1319
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
Turn into current events

1320
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
She said she was

1321
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
I'm going to get into current events

1322
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,879
Really at all very Alex Jones

1323
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Cersei

1324
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,023
For background to this information I've given you

1325
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
He must watch

1326
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,191
The Project Camelot interviews especially watch with sweater called whistleblowers

1327
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,311
Disciplinary

1328
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,639
And so what you can do is learn a great deal

1329
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,199
By adding and connecting the dots

1330
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,527
And this is really all I'm doing it's not rocket science

1331
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
Easy to do

1332
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:58,975
But what I find is that most people out there regardless of how much study they do

1333
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
And this includes Mike

1334
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
So-called calling

1335
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,143
Do not have the ability to

1336
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,215
Connect the dots because they are not paying

1337
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
Attention

1338
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
Especially

1339
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,847
To some of the most important Witnesses out there

1340
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
It has to do with

1341
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Obviously

1342
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,271
People like William Tompkins people like Mark Richards Captain Mark Richards

1343
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
So I've interviewed in prison

1344
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:32,255
Reminder she believes she has a personified spaceship

1345
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,327
Minerva

1346
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,143
Chocolate

1347
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Camelot

1348
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,727
And many many more

1349
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,287
Another word for obviously

1350
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
Store in attics

1351
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Thriller

1352
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Beginning

1353
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
Story until now

1354
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
Then you don't understand

1355
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,295
What is happening

1356
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,903
You do not understand what is going on when the Illuminati decide

1357
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
Splat operation

1358
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,583
Decide to test a weapon such as they are doing in Northern California

1359
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
Certain areas of

1360
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
Campground

1361
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
Sort of a slash-and-burn mentality

1362
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,055
Which is what they've done

1363
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,127
Santa Rosa area

1364
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,455
You do not understand the bigger picture

1365
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
You don't understand why they're doing this

1366
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,807
And so you can't even believe

1367
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,623
That they are doing it that it's being orchestrated

1368
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
She just said no

1369
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,975
She doesn't say

1370
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,767
C clearing off land

1371
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:42,399
But here's the thing makes it a lot of metaphors and then also at the same time confusing like

1372
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
These

1373
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
So-called

1374
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
People who have

1375
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,031
What you would call

1376
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
Stuff to do

1377
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
Sings

1378
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Like

1379
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
What you would call

1380
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,175
Going outside

1381
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,783
No you don't need to pad with so many words like right

1382
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,575
We can use language

1383
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
It's tough

1384
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Itstototime

1385
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
The.

1386
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Figure out what the

1387
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,999
The through-line is there go back look

1388
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
See if there are more.

1389
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
And if you can't connect those dots

1390
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,119
You don't even know why fires happened Dan

1391
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
At this point

1392
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,959
Fire is a false flag by the Illuminati

1393
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,287
At this point I don't know what it. Is

1394
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,639
Hey hey here's a. I've connected archaic anti-semitism

1395
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,967
So there's that

1396
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
Weird

1397
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Problem comes in

1398
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,647
To this like what is being

1399
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,999
Psycho

1400
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,071
It's going to fall apart pretty tremendously when the everything

1401
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Gets rebuilt

1402
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
Hello

1403
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,447
The argument is probably not very valid

1404
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
You know

1405
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
We live off the land where they took

1406
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
It's reused probably exact same way

1407
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
Also it works well because it creates

1408
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Jobs

1409
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
Everybody knows

1410
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Set the best

1411
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Contractors

1412
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,063
Are the spider leadership

1413
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,415
No Doubt

1414
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
Somebody they can

1415
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,047
Spin their own

1416
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
With silken they started going straight

1417
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
Undoubtedly

1418
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:26,335
Drywall

1419
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
Start

1420
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:31,199
Spinning Brick Mason spiders

1421
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,247
Right of course

1422
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:37,087
She doesn't believe has provided of course

1423
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
Cardboard

1424
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,719
She doesn't believe that

1425
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
Are the fires

1426
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Are real or legit

1427
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
Vegas is

1428
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,215
A controlled situation

1429
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
Orchestrated

1430
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,311
That it was not alone gunmen

1431
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,359
That Paddock is

1432
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Appearances

1433
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
Manchurian Candidate

1434
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,623
And it's even possible that he

1435
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,719
We got to look

1436
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
Below the surface

1437
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,839
In a deeper way than what's going on on YouTube right now

1438
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,143
People have to start understanding

1439
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:27,007
That our military has been fighting with various races Avicii

1440
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
Behind the scenes

1441
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,359
And that these ETFs have the ability

1442
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
To wipe the mines

1443
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
Connect

1444
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,247
Your Consciousness in such a way

1445
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,599
If you do not recall seeing them and this goes for soldiers on the battlefield

1446
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,463
Hat

1447
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,999
Christy Moore about that

1448
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,583
Whether it's the reptoids

1449
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,375
Who are building Stargate

1450
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
In the Middle East

1451
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,215
The reason there is

1452
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,519
Constant battle going on in the Middle East

1453
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
At least partially

1454
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
Because they are

1455
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
Very much you there

1456
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,455
Israeli

1457
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
Many loyalties

1458
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
Is to alien

1459
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,023
Isis is controlled by alien

1460
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
That makes as much sense as anything else

1461
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,631
Sure

1462
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Really

1463
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
Let's face it

1464
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,519
They're very obvious like it's just

1465
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:37,919
It's just that this team so far out there but is there any difference between aliens or God

1466
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,967
Not really

1467
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,527
Is this any Dumber

1468
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:48,415
Minerva is your flying than a congressman holding up

1469
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:54,815
Climate change isn't real but hear me out on this

1470
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
Which is just like

1471
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,679
More familiar with certain types

1472
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,287
The crazy Asians for religion are much more simple

1473
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,943
They're usually needed fall back on God works in mysterious ways

1474
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
She's got to come up with

1475
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,319
Like Byzantine organizations in order to rationalize

1476
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:22,719
Isis being controlled by aliens

1477
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
But

1478
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,215
Stupid

1479
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
Much more amusing

1480
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,799
Is because of the

1481
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
Explain thing

1482
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,615
Or else probably like

1483
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:45,247
You're making this up that's what happens now because we're whistleblower

1484
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,831
I guess there are people who had like

1485
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,415
Near-death experiences

1486
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:56,767
That's what the this is what happened whenever science

1487
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
Actually worked

1488
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,863
Like this is the issue with all of these crazy

1489
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:06,495
And it's the same thing that happens with with God people now trying to explain why Evolution isn't real

1490
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,031
Right

1491
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:13,151
These were planted by God to test your faith

1492
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
These different

1493
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,247
Eve ever more complicated explanations

1494
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
In order to just

1495
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
Justified the belief in something

1496
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
Nothing stupid break Eli

1497
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
We figured it out

1498
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,951
Boring

1499
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Even though it's

1500
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:32,095
And Incredibly exciting and magical thing that we know stuff it has to be

1501
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,143
Ridiculous

1502
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,447
You're expressing something that I think you'll agree

1503
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,471
With what Carrie says

1504
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
Beginning of this

1505
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
Connect the

1506
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,383
Circles of dots with

1507
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,431
No I think you agree with the first sentence

1508
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
Sylvester and that everything else

1509
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
Is it really

1510
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,135
Do a vote for

1511
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
4Health

1512
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:02,815
Of the human race

1513
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:07,167
Wonderful really the effort is

1514
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,079
To help people understand that if there are battles going on

1515
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
Eons

1516
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,663
For eons with the Anunnaki

1517
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
In the Middle East

1518
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,991
And other races

1519
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,807
Why we are at odds with a Ron

1520
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,831
And the races

1521
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
That arawn

1522
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Is associated with

1523
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,231
And why we are actually already at war with North Korea

1524
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,791
Because North Korea has been back

1525
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,839
By certain erase

1526
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
And our real war is with that 80 race

1527
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,703
And not necessarily the North

1528
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
Korean

1529
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,823
So this is what we have to start to understand

1530
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:49,663
I mean if you just take away the alien race and put globulus

1531
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Standard

1532
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Large live

1533
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,503
I have

1534
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,367
So boring of one level

1535
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,183
DaVinci's racist against

1536
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
Imaginary

1537
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,791
Racism is bad

1538
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Even if it's made up

1539
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,143
What does it matter

1540
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,935
The Harvard bias against

1541
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,007
Alien races

1542
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,079
Frustrated

1543
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
It rolls off me like water off a duck

1544
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,967
But it's just look I know it's low on issue

1545
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,087
Problems feel like you should be racing

1546
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
Anyway

1547
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Like maybe

1548
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Maybe Carrie

1549
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,487
If you acknowledge that all of these

1550
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,047
People are individuals

1551
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,095
Perhaps

1552
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,215
Maybe Raptors are not one monolithic black

1553
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,799
Maybe these are people maybe it's the spider leadership that that

1554
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,359
Because you not spiders

1555
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:56,223
It's not that we're at war with North Korea we're at war with North Korea's government

1556
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,831
The North Korean people are wonderful people should not do human eyes them

1557
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
I say that they're just part of

1558
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,671
I honestly think that might be what you

1559
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
You trying to

1560
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
Express

1561
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,767
In some way or another the idea that the

1562
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,071
The dictatorship that's in place

1563
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
In North Korea is

1564
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Alien

1565
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
2

1566
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Peaceful

1567
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Okay

1568
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
I don't think

1569
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
But she understands

1570
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,359
That might be what you trying to say

1571
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,687
Because she really believes that they were aliens pulling the strings

1572
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
And what are you

1573
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:33,855
Who is the world is

1574
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
Rough

1575
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,207
It's rough out there right now

1576
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
And it's complicated

1577
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,535
It's very difficult

1578
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
Except

1579
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
In the case

1580
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Alexa Las Vegas

1581
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
Shooting

1582
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,191
Right

1583
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
There is

1584
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
The potential Within

1585
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Humanity

1586
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,335
To be a dictator and oppress your people

1587
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
There is

1588
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:55,871
Potential

1589
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
Within humans

1590
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Have

1591
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,503
Centuries long conflicts Regional

1592
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
Between ethnic groups

1593
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Between

1594
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
Different

1595
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Population

1596
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,207
Raticate is possible that is what we come from

1597
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
That's the route

1598
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
Humanity that's not like

1599
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,071
Aliens making us do it

1600
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,119
But it's so much more comforting

1601
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,655
Deseo it's aliens

1602
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
Talking Tom 2

1603
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,495
Realized

1604
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,055
But for the grace of God that could be

1605
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
You know doing all these things

1606
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Possible

1607
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,663
Circumstances could be Vivid like

1608
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
You know

1609
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,967
You born differently

1610
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,551
Episode of this podcast

1611
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,135
I know everything about Alex Joseph

1612
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,671
That's right

1613
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:46,303
I know everything about Raptors alternate universe

1614
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:50,399
I thought about hiring people to kill things right

1615
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
It I have

1616
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
I was trying to move on

1617
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,055
Just apathetic comfort

1618
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
You know a lot of these dudes

1619
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,735
I think they ended up living not great

1620
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
Live not the lies that they wanted

1621
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
Backstory app

1622
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,975
A secret Soldier for 50 years

1623
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,767
Protecting the solar Guardian

1624
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:23,167
Or whatever and miraculously I was put back into my 18 year old body 15 minutes later

1625
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Some dead-end jobs

1626
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,543
I'm not really all that interesting I made it to middle management

1627
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,871
I mean here I am I'm single at 50 and

1628
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,711
I guess I meant I like I like Star Trek

1629
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,503
Like I have some

1630
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,039
Comparisons in my life but

1631
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
I-i've amounted

1632
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
It's not really anything

1633
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
The changes the world

1634
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
Much more fun

1635
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:46,463
To say that the other bike store

1636
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,999
Two-faced became king of America

1637
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,047
The guy in San Francisco

1638
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,471
The earlier like the midday

1639
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,287
1800

1640
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
American music

1641
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,663
Got to hear this guy out

1642
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,223
Eventually

1643
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:13,599
So what he would do if he was like a panhandler

1644
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
Do people love it

1645
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,927
Human money I saw

1646
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:23,327
Call Edwin

1647
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:29,727
Soaking and when he died there was a huge procession in like 20,000 people came out to watch

1648
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:34,847
Celebrity early San Francisco celebrity

1649
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
Creating this fantasy world

1650
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:43,039
Checks out I don't know in Columbia Missouri there was a guy who declared himself King as well

1651
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Street drunk

1652
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,183
Burger King crown

1653
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
Declared himself the king of Columbia

1654
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:54,559
All right now I like that the police routine

1655
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,351
I would just take him out

1656
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
2

1657
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Cityline

1658
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
The the

1659
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,983
It would be called

1660
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,567
Just the border of Columbia

1661
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:10,175
Go to another time

1662
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,247
Not yet we don't have charges to press get out

1663
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,807
Right

1664
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,391
Disagreed with that to their policy quite a bit

1665
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:24,255
Absolutely

1666
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
He would have become

1667
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,583
I think a lot of people.

1668
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:32,191
A lot of people

1669
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
It's great

1670
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:41,407
We started the show by Kerris explaining that Rob

1671
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Get today

1672
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,855
Get to close it up by her talking

1673
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:58,047
The fact that Robert David Steele was unable to join me on this broadcast in spite of the fact

1674
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,887
This information before the broadcast

1675
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,215
Keep within full Consciousness about it

1676
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
However he

1677
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,079
Got direction from outside one can imagine

1678
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,943
Knowing that he is a member of a certain group

1679
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
And he is himself

1680
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
Working as a good guy

1681
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
Really

1682
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:23,391
To disclose certain information but he has found that the

1683
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,463
As we say the secret space

1684
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,559
The real story about the ET intervention here on planet Earth

1685
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,863
It's something that he's not allowed to

1686
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:38,239
Elaborate on in spite of the fact that he did go on Alex Jones and allude to it

1687
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,287
And he never backed off

1688
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:47,711
He understood there to be ten thousand humans on Mars who are never coming home

1689
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,271
Some of them were sent there as children

1690
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
So this is the kind of information

1691
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,159
That if you do not put that together

1692
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,975
With things like the fires in

1693
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
Northern California

1694
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:04,351
Which obviously is a directed-energy weapon

1695
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,679
It appears that maybe a laser-based

1696
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Directed energy weapon

1697
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
Maybe the issue is that it's

1698
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Not a direct

1699
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
Hey it's just a while

1700
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,640
Right

1701
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
Caused by a drought

1702
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,968
The years-long drought

1703
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,248
Drying everything out

1704
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
Wendy's wildfires that I have happening there

1705
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
Usually from

1706
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Somebody accidentally

1707
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,952
Do you know setting a fire right or camping

1708
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,000
Lightning strikes

1709
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,864
Illegitimate part of the ecosystem like we would

1710
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,936
Have sequoia trees if it weren't for

1711
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,032
Right like there is there is a natural

1712
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
Contain them

1713
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Not

1714
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Like try and Destroy them

1715
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
The problem is

1716
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
We can't contain the

1717
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
Anymore

1718
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
Bright

1719
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
It's not a laser

1720
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,576
Yeah

1721
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:01,696
He was like

1722
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
Nah

1723
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,584
Cuz if you said she sent him the information that you wanted to talk about

1724
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,888
He would have read that in Dragon Ball

1725
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,936
That's too far even for me

1726
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
Robert

1727
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,080
Things I'm still trying

1728
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,152
Yeah I can't come along on this ride with

1729
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
Steve Perry

1730
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
Whoa

1731
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,760
Lady you are nuts

1732
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Yeah

1733
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
Robert Davis

1734
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,424
Bastille I'm pretty comfortable saying

1735
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,472
He is

1736
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Barely

1737
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
Dubious

1738
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,360
I am probably a medic

1739
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,664
I don't want to say out in out

1740
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
He is just

1741
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Because

1742
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
I don't think that

1743
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
I don't think it's

1744
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,624
He's trying to skirt the line of

1745
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,160
He's playing games

1746
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,464
Yeah and I think the reason is because he

1747
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,048
Some are not true

1748
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
He's attracting

1749
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
And perhaps cording

1750
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,728
But not necessarily diving whole-hog into

1751
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
Is unfortunately

1752
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
Whether or not

1753
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
The clip that we played at the top

1754
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
The show is as dammit

1755
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Feel

1756
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,552
The stuff the world

1757
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
View the blood libel

1758
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,928
Is clearly indicative of where

1759
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
What you believe

1760
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
And it is

1761
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,072
Boy alex

1762
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,424
104 so if you want another one of those things like

1763
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
Just like Alex

1764
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
Robert Davis

1765
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
Stihl insist he's not

1766
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,824
Zionist

1767
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
Call different

1768
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,152
That don't do that

1769
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,432
No I am

1770
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
I'm not blanketly agreeing with these people

1771
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,600
Amongst all of the clips that we have he goes

1772
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,608
You are often right about everything and I have nothing to disagree with you about

1773
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,728
It's just you have your words wrong

1774
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,592
Drew say global

1775
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,688
A lot of stuff is there was better evidence

1776
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,968
For some of the stuff

1777
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,552
Play cuz it's it's not impossible that someone ever

1778
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,696
And it's not it's not impossible that like I've seen

1779
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:45,792
I've seen Batman Begins I know that there is like

1780
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
There is of course

1781
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
What's this

1782
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:53,216
Play scarecrow this possibility

1783
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
What's the weather like those sorts of things are

1784
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,336
Conceivably possible but you have to have better evidence

1785
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
You have to have a better

1786
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:05,504
To be more real or else your operating off these

1787
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Archaic beliefs

1788
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
That are just bigotry

1789
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,856
Congratulations

1790
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,648

1793
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
Been shaped

1794
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,488
Buy lies

1795

Humans are still so shity

1799
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
You're dumb

1800
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,032
I don't know

1801
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,616
Being Human are those people who donate to wash out

1802
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,504

Nobody knows

1812
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,568
This is been a years-long cover-up

1813
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,616
By the Raptors

1814
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,992

1822
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,032
There's one person

I know

1824
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Isn't

1825
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Okay

1826
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
He's not a reptile

1827
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Okay

1828
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,712
Might be a dragon mouth but I don't know about that

1829
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
Definitely not romantic

1830
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,528
No

1831
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
Could be in a theory

1832
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:51,232
I do I would anything about this.

1833
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:58,400
Even though he's not one of those eat even though he's not one of those et's that are ruining everything even though he

1834
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,448
He doesn't have any direct laser weapon
