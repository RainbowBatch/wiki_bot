Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,080
Little bit

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
About Alex J

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Who's your favorite

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,344
Potatoes do you put over where you at

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Quest

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
Quite frankly there's a lot of prep potatoes presentation

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,840
I would say that I'm partial to mashed potatoes because

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
It's kind of a cumbersome

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Process to make them

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:43,264
And so when they show up it's usually special

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
I would say

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Top

14
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Are up there

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
I always forget about

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
If you have to choose the best fry talk probably doesn't count so they waffle waffle fries probably tomorrow

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,096
Very underrated

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
With thanks

19
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
It's in there it's in the conversation

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Ways to eat potatoes

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Simplify

22
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Lava Crunch

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
The most riveting conversation I am a little hungry

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,304
Thankfully our out-of-context drop which will here in a little bit has something to do with food

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,192
Potatoes

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
About the fight

27
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:51,360
We are in the present will be going over May 30th

28
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Of the week that was

31
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
I really appreciate it

32
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
So Steven thank you so much

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Strawberry

00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,728
Text Sophia

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Thank you

36
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Jason thank you so much

37
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Journal pollywog

38
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm a policy wonk

39
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,832
Donations and pump it up a little bit

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,904
So first of all Kim thank you so much you are now

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
Heroin

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
So good

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Freakishly large

44
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
You are now watching

45
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Heroin

46
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Freakishly large

47
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,968
Absolutely

48
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Interested in

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
Finding out that Alex is very predictable

50
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Press conference

51
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
She does come up

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,936
Can't be real. In the context of the mother stuff but he has a

53
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
We'll discuss that today as it comes up

54
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
Seems like I got to

55
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,016
Spend a lot of time covering live stream the right-wing media

56
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
Alex's take on the

57
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,744
And a very small part of what makes

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
These two days about

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
What's the show

60
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Super f***** up

61
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
They reach

62
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Levels of astonishment

63
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,055
Haven't had in awhile in quite a while

64
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Really

65
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Really took me aback

66
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Where are we

67
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
It's like out of left field Somali pirate territory or we out of a wound

68
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
With racism

69
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,927
More the latter than the price

70
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
Catch me as you got to give it up for this Miley Cyrus rarefied class

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Alex Jones,

72
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
But before we get into any of the

73
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
I was around

74
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
Or somebody bought donuts and I just inhaled two of them

75
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
I love them so much

76
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,983
I love it so much

77
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Little moments ever

78
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Appreciate

79
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,319
So soft and deliver

80
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
God dammit

81
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,975
I'm so in this first clip we start on the 30th

82
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
And Alex

83
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Has some information

84
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,887
And it's the explanation of why the globalist

85
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Want to get him off

86
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
The air right which is

87
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,591
He's explained to us I don't know about billion f****** time

88
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,479
Little bit different

89
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Explain

90
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
It was true

91
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
But this is the reason the globalist want to get him off the air

92
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
That may be a good thing

93
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
Establishment wants me author

94
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
And that list includes a long string of retired respected generals and other

95
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
Military

96
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,255
Because their people Robinson was singing on my phone calls in Fresno

97
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Recalled affect me

98
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
Thursday

99
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,087
That was just a pat on the head sir

100
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
They're coming after you

101
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
You got people

102
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
I said you got people lying to you that are bringing these folks in

103
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Here's this particular lady that they brought in

104
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
I can explain that

105
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
Off the air or whatever because

106
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
He was telling the president

107
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Stuff like this

108
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
He's misleading the

109
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
And that would be fine

110
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
If the president wasn't a sundowning moron

111
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
That is an issue

112
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Yeah yeah

113
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
How do you think I knew that

114
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
I realize well

115
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
See if I can figure out first of all what the f*** is talking

116
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
Somebody about context clues

117
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
Write about a woman

118
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
I was brought into trumps

119
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Somehow

120
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,831
Reduces the

121
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
But he's actually Soros operative

122
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
What is it

123
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Doobie quote over the Stanford

124
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
If it means being cheapest

125
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Conspiracy Alex's warning Trump with autism

126
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Because guess what

127
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
46

128
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Under its original name

129
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
To the president

130
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
No woman has ever filled that role

131
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
So obviously the

132
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Metallica

133
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Weird because that's who does a lot of

134
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,455
The Oval Office

135
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
Mick Mulvaney

136
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
That's a fairly recent

137
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
People who were around under the Rings

138
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
John Kelly

139
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
The number to pin down who Alex's talk

140
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
Obama had no female Chief of Staff however there were

141
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Deputy chief

142
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
So maybe this is

143
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
Obama Hillary a holdover

144
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
But unfortunately none of them stuck around it all alleged Trump

145
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Administration

146
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,455
I wonder what the two are still around in 2017 both last on a dog

147
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
I wonder why

148
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,575
Kate Walsh was a deputy chief of staff working on schedule

149
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
For the trumpet

150
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Menstration

151
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
She was on board from the jump and she was part of the transition

152
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
But you left ministration early in March 27th

153
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Pro Trump dark money Super PAC

154
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
America First policy

155
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Which was founded by Brad Parr scholly

156
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
Trump head of digital operations

157
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Is the 2016

158
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,055
A lot of trump Administration folk found their way to America First Paula

159
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
So did

160
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Some Nazis

161
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
I don't understand why are those two separate

162
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
Words in your car the two separate statements

163
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,575
I believe they are redundant and sound

164
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,183
Is there director of advocacy

165
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
After a bunch of old radio shows

166
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Super islamophobic

167
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Super anti algae

168
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
Navigator for being able to shoot

169
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
Kill anyone who came across the border on.

170
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,287
Whoa whoa whoa guys why are you getting rid of me I

171
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
I don't want the last one anymore this is called America first

172
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
Policies what have I done wrong

173
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Everything's that guy is

174
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
I was probably the one

175
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Surrounded America

176
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
The first policy

177
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
He's out there

178
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
The guy who was there

179
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Juan Pablo Andrade

180
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:19,679
Previously been on Trump's National Hispanic advisory Council as well as

181
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Before heading to the Super PAC America

182
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
The first policy

183
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Newsmax

184
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
Put them on their 30 under 30 list

185
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Justin 27

186
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,687
He was a real rising star in the dumb dumb

187
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
Unfortunately that you're his star exploded

188
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
What do you recorded himself in a hotel room at a turning point USA conference

189
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Hotel room I should point out that

190
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
He wasn't just an attempt

191
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
He was there

192
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Invitation

193
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,655
Right in the video he says quote the only thing the Nazis

194
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
He's didn't get right is that they didn't keep

195
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Keep f****** going

196
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
I'm sure

197
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Just joking but you look more into the circle

198
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Natalie wasn't

199
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
Yeah I know I think at a certain point you guys we all got it

200
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Just admit that

201
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
A few bad apples

202
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Amounts

203
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
To actually they're creating

204
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
He's on purpose

205
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
That's what they want

206
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
Caught we all know that the whole thing is not

207
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Weird

208
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,759
To be literally dripping with bigots and is run by Trump's the head of

209
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Communications

210
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Digital communication

211
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Yeah unless she's a real

212
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Guess what

213
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
She is who I was talking about

214
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
In the early days of the Trump campaign paranoia was it if

215
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Fever pitch on all sides

216
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Books on the West in the middle were rightfully very worried about what was coming

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
But the right was really worried

218
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Slightly different issue

219
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,871
Particularly the more authoritarian

220
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Does that was crushed within the Trump Administration

221
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
He wouldn't be able to enact the white supremacy

222
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Supposition face supported

223
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
There's a real sense that the real progress towards an awful end

224
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,511
But the biggest thing that stood in the way with the people who were inside

225
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,887
Mike cernovich Jack pestova cats

226
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
Throughout the people who could possibly slow down the March towards their dystopia

227
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Targeting unnamed

228
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Collaborators and wolves and she

229
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Sheep's clothing

230
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Within the administration

231
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
You remember this from Alex Jones is show back then

232
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
There was so much talk about internal pallet entry

233
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Every

234
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Single f****** show was about

235
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
You know the things that I love the most about

236
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
How little reminds me of Stalin

237
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Yeah that's my favorite part

238
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
Very very unsimilar

239
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
Correlate

240
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
The goal was

241
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Threefold

242
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Rhetoric this

243
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
People who are wolves

244
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Keeps closing within the inner machinations

245
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
How you build a pre-emptive excuse for why Trump isn't getting anything

246
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
You maintain the climate of fear you

247
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
You needed your audience that should be diminished by their guy being

248
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
You make an example of people in government

249
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Of how anyone who deceived

250
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Deviating from the program will be treated

251
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,863
The chief propagandists rationalize their attacks on government

252
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Easiest blanket accusation to throw it anyway

253
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
It wasn't to stop leaks

254
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
The root Outlet

255
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
It's to create a Perpetual feeling of a witch

256
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
We're purchase of government employees who fail

257
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Is that the purging of them is

258
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Should support

259
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Is

260
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
An actual

261
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
If they if this were in the soul

262
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Supporters of the

263
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Castration crowdsourcing

264
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
This

265
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Please the motivation of the rationals

266
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
For the birds

267
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Directly from the

268
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Right

269
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,111
It's kind of a situation I think all of these guys

270
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
All of the guys

271
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
Empower but for so long the people in power on the right

272
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
Have been stoking these

273
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Horrible horrible impulses

274
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
In order to win election

275
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Knowing full well that what they would if they were 2X

276
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
Rather be illegal

277
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
People would start getting murdered

278
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
Yeah

279
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
And

280
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
Abusing and end

281
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Exploiting

282
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Finally were like

283
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
What if we just killed everybody

284
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,487
Or we're not going to be controlled anymore by this kind of exploited of relationship

285
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
And then they

286
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Do this

287
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah

288
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,679
If not kill then at least root out or metaphor

289
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Send to

290
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Re-education

291
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Kept doing

292
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
It just kept happening

293
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
In those early days

294
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Threats of purges

295
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Suspected

296
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Conformist

297
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Do the program

298
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,879
This over and over again the previous loyalty

299
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,463
To get routed out which of course eventually became

300
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Or the Kushner Loyola

301
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Could morph it however you want

302
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
In order to

303
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Maintain that climate of fear

304
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
And paranoia of

305
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Excuse

306
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
You know impotence

307
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Yeah that first year or two I think

308
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Banks are worth

309
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
300 separate

310
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Profiles

311
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,527
The adult in the room completely person

312
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
Then you're like you got to realize there are no more

313
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
And that's kind of a lot of the other

314
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Sommore

315
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Older

316
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Meteor

317
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Data

318
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Disservice

319
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Yeah.

320
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Media

321
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
That was

322
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
Yeah

323
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Is reporting that after the most read

324
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
Kim Jeong hoon and Donald Trump didn't go so great

325
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
And carried out a purge of government officials who were in charge of

326
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Negotiate

327
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
For it

328
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
Control counterpart to Mike Pompeo in the

329
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,927
Was allegedly executed along with for foreign Ministry officials who stood accused

330
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Of spying for the United

331
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
When the North Korean state

332
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
This alleged spying boiled down to

333
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Quit poorly grasping us intentions

334
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Give me to go station

335
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,567
There were reports that these people weren't executed but some of suggested they were just sent to a hard laborer

336
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
For re-education

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Which I mean I guess it's better than killing p

338
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Be bold by Dido

339
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Watch better seriously

340
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
Not good

341
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Curated

342
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
In Austin have

343
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
A results

344
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
So what people like Chucky

345
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
Kind of reference crowdsourcing

346
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
Authoritarianism into the

347
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
True democracy

348
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Sure

349
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
Classical liberalism

350
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
We all f*** ourselves

351
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
My point is that it's very hard

352
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
To radio have

353
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Like Stark

354
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Reminders of this

355
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Just happen to North Korea

356
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,855
It's really hard to look at that sort of behavior that was going on instinct

357
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,463
Dudes who are doing this which Auntie Behavior about to officials

358
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
To work on board

359
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
The f****** knew what they were doing

360
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,519
Oh yeah it's almost inconceivable realize

361
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Yeah well that's ridiculous

362
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Do these right-wing douchebag

363
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Won't go that far

364
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
Look at what happened North Korea

365
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
They're going to go as far as

366
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Get away with

367
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
They're going to go as far as I can feel come

368
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Westerville getting away with

369
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,535
I'm not saying that there's North Korea

370
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Probably further

371
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
I think it's true

372
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Human impulses

373
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Yeah

374
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Alex

375
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Has

376
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
A real serious problem on it

377
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
And that is that

378
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
The EU

379
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
This is a problem

380
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
Because Alex constantly says that the EU Parliament is

381
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Is unelected

382
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
However

383
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Because

384
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
Is his buddies in the brexit party won a bunch of seats

385
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
It's on display where Alex

386
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
10 seconds

387
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Abusive

388
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
So it is a Templar at the end

389
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
That hurt me very much physically it's a whiplash

390
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
I am having

391
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,639
Brexit party

392
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
That is

393
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Baseline problem

394
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
For Alex

395
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,063
Here's one of the constant arguments he's made was that it's governed by an unelected

396
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Bureaucrats in the parliament

397
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
It's a constant drumbeat on his show

398
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Is repeated over and over again

399
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Is a compound noun

400
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Unelected has become an epithet

401
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
In the same way that gentle was

402
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Super Truck

403
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
That's all good and well except when there's an

404
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
New parliamentary election being held

405
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Which there was this girl

406
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
Alex doesn't this clip its 5 years ago people didn't know that

407
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
You Parliament is unelected

408
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Which is interesting

409
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Because Alexa

410
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Comparing every size

411
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
So you specifically

412
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Parliament

413
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,280
See how this is freaking consisted internally really really frustrating me

414
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
Do you Parliament to begin isn't

415
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Initially the MEP

416
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Peers or members of European Parliament were appointed by each

417
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Which countries elect

418
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
Did parliament so their National Parliament

419
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Would elect

420
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Choose the people who workout

421
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
He's in the Europe

422
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
Still a democratic route a little closer to legit and that's

423
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
It's like saying that the Secretary of State

424
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
Technically that's true but they're appointed by a directly

425
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Elected president

426
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
And have to be confirmed by directly elect

427
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Did members of Congress

428
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
In terms of the EU Parliament over Alex's claims really don't make

429
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Because the night

430
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
79

431
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
They started holding Alexa

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
For the wrong number

433
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,432
With only a few rules in place about proportional representation that are universally required

434
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Member states are free to run their elections

435
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
Their parliamentary representative however they choose

436
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
Which is a great celebration of national sovereignty

437
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Which Alex doesn't want to talk about

438
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Is very annoying

439
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,048
It is very annoying this information annoys me

440
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Are you I am vexed

441
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Fixed by the fact

442
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
He is holding both of these

443
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
Conflicting points of view at the same time it's like him saying that

444
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
3 people voted for the Federal Reserve

445
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
Really be talking about is the position of the president of the European Commission

446
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
He was an unelected

447
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Deposition

448
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
The various political parties

449
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Vote

450
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
What's will be the

451
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
But that post isn't the same as like being the

452
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Europe

453
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,888
The position is described as being the first among equals in the European Commission

454
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Members of the commissioners

455
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Selected by elected governments of member

456
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
Country's interest

457
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
In the context of a collaborative body that balances the larger needs of

458
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,248
These examples of unelected folks within the hierarchy

459
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
You government are easy to point to as examples of undemocratic

460
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Government run amok

461
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,672
But if you look at them closely you find that each of these appointed positions

462
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,744
Garfield directly by people who are elected by the people

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
And they could be ousted from their positions by electing

464
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
If Alex wants to be philosophically consistent attack

465
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:39,264
These positions for being indirectly elected requires a problem with every appointed position in our government

466
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,592
Every cabinet secretary should have to be directly elected

467
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
What about Krishna foxy doing

468
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
I almost

469
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Every

470
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
For almost every foreign country that has a prime minister becomes a problem for him the list goes on and on and on

471
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
Officials who are just unelected

472
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
I ordered directly elected

473
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Purely Technical Center

474
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
You can play

475
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
This European commission is unelected

476
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
What Alex

477
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
He's been stupid

478
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
Is not true

479
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,360
For years he's been able to just be free to lie about the EU Parliament cuz he knows that none of his listeners were going to look into it

480
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,944
But then like three months ago Nigel farage stuck at the brexit party

481
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
It became clear that the story election was going to be

482
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Favorable

483
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Smash monster taking over the world narrative

484
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
Immediately he had a huge problem

485
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
How do you maintain your b******* about the EU Parliament elected while simultaneously bragging about your Euros skeptic and fascist

486
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Parliamentary

487
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Put your

488
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Finger up to your head and you

489
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
Tangled webs we weave when first we

490
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Is to deceive

491
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Event venues

492
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,152
Right

493
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Particulars

494
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,320
Put on a little set piece

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
Pretty much

496
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
That's discuss

497
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
Well I mean it's it's one in a long line I think of Alex being screwed over by getting what he wants

498
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
EU Parliament positions

499
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
Destroy the EU I guess

500
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
But in order for that

501
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
They be elected

502
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
This Parliament

503
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
One of his chief complaint

504
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
About it

505
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
Succeeding in the goal

506
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
He's working towards

507
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Undercuts and destroys

508
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
One of his big reasons for wanting it gone

509
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,424
National Health Service

510
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,008
Like so many people who voted as it was

511
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,848
Gina with Boris

512
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
Is money

513
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
And they voted specifically for that type of

514
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Danzig

515
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
Of course if brexit actually follows through with the way that it

516
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,440
Play with the No Deal Services going to be privatized my American Insurance

517
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,256
Are all doing something that is active

518
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,584
Whatever it is

519
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Seems like

520
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
A real strong current among the

521
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,496
Quote on quote International nationalist

522
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,336
Like 390 the only people

523
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,432
Play not know it's I think I think that might be the

524
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
They

525
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
That's what you don't want to say

526
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
Did that support they don't want that stuff

527
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
So

528
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Text clip Alex

529
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Has a list of complaints about him

530
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
About

531
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
People that he perceives

532
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
As being against

533
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Comerica

534
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
I want to do things that I find really interesting about this

535
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
He's Furious

536
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
How many gigs does Liz

537
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
About his

538
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
No no no no

539
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
Somebody wants a debate Ronald Reagan wants that conversation

540
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
What are you guys want is

541
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
To list off things

542
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
So

543
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,192
Explain each of these and why they're not true

544
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,312
Chinese Express in why he doesn't like the other side that he proceeded

545
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Every single thing he says is not true

546
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
Show

547
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
That we're trying to get our country back

548
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Commence

549
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
Cauliflower

550
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Toledo

551
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
So

552
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
Case study it's almost

553
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
Inconceivable

554
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Knows that he's intentionally misleading

555
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Volume

556
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
It's important to remember for the purposes of what's to come that he is a forty-five-year-old human who claims

557
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,488
Hebrew

558
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
He be able to do that on a nominal level

559
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
However

560
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Literally everything about clip

561
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Examples of things that are real

562
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Let's look at that one by one

563
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
The red begins with stuff it's too vague to mean anything

564
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,480
Alex buddies or reclaim the country from them and that they hate America

565
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
Literally nothing to even respond to that's just him talking

566
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
So we can leave that aside

567
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Little warm-up he's doing a couple of jumping jacks and now we're going to get into the bullshitz the word you have to get into an impression

568
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
I've never been never will be

569
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:09,504
This isn't intentional mischaracterization of comments made by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo

570
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
Trays make America great again

571
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,464
By expressing a very defensible position that for many people

572
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
The part of the quote that Alex's specifically using America

573
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
Great again it was never that great

574
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
But the quote

575
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Relies on what Cuomo said amidi

576
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Ali after that in order to give his

577
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Context

578
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
He went on to say quotes

579
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
We have not reached great

580
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged

581
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Will reach greatness when

582
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
Discrimination stereotyping of women 51% of our population

583
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
It's gone and every woman's full potential is realized and Unleashed

584
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
Every woman is making her.

585
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,144
Naturally it would have been nice if you would have expanded its going to include other groups but

586
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
Specifically the New York women's rights event

587
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Map direction

588
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
What Cuomo was saying is

589
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
Not in any way an insult to America it's a wreck

590
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Ignition dinner ideals are great believe

591
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,736
Historical

592
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
What he was doing when he said quote we are not going to make America great again

593
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Was not saying f*** America

594
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
It was

595
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Clear difference

596
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
Between Trump's catchphrase Cuomo's vision

597
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
Of what are greatness

598
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Should strive for

599
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
This is a willing interpretation misinterpretation Metallica

600
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
Both version of

601
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,520
And paint them as Bank of America has always Comerica

602
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
That one

603
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
That one is the far-right reaction

604
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Any kind of

605
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Like if you are

606
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Blunt

607
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
The far-right about America

608
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,368
They will do anything and everything please

609
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,208
Because I can't handle

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
So afraid

611
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
Call the races

612
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Just doesn't want to

613
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Feel bad

614
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,240
It does come down to their fathers were terrorists

615
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,944
Direction of course in Star Wars

616
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
The rebel good terrorist

617
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
He doesn't like it

618
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,232
12 years as a reference to an interview that Alexandria ocasio-cortez

619
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,304
Where to cut emissions by 50

620
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,912
Alex is turning this into some kind of Doomsday Prophecy that you was peddling which

621
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
It's kind of hilarious considering what you did

622
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,360
She pretty Horsley for that everything

623
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:50,016
But all she was doing was citing a report from the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change said exactly

624
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
They predicted there's probably 12 years left to keep Global temperature

625
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
Pictures from rising to a maximum of 1.5 degrees

626
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
Yeah I was amazed

627
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
Like I assumed that everybody would know that she was

628
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Who is quoting something

629
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Now that I think about it

630
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
Of course on the right had no idea what that reports

631
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:12,544
Is it wasn't carbon credit

632
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Even this

633
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
Interview

634
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
12 years if we don't address climate

635
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
However

636
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
T.i. what sheets that just before that

637
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
The larger context that I quoted that

638
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
The younger generation

639
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Millennials and gen Z

640
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:33,024
The older Generations

641
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Before it destroys the world

642
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Any older Generations

643
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
Responses how are we going to pay

644
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,728
Ending part of the quote was dry humor

645
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
There's a little bit of that that's clearly apparent

646
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,872
Just say the truth clearly

647
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
She isn't in that interview baking

648
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,504
Specific prophecy that we have 12 years left then it's all over

649
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
She's referencing the

650
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
Epic study in articulating diffusion

651
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Concerns of a big cross section

652
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
No one is saying that the world will end in 12 years if we don't do anything

653
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:08,352
Amount of time we have before things will be completely out of our hands and no amount of emission

654
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
Got it. The Domino effects of climate change

655
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
Alex's misrepresenting decent

656
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
To create the image

657
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Text trying to

658
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Doomsday prophecies

659
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
In order to go

660
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Get a carbon credit

661
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
I really

662
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Like there should be a

663
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Advice

664
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Adjustment

665
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
For these

666
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Just a tease

667
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,744
You know like how would they do polls Rasmus in has a rightward bias

668
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,816
All of these Studies have a optimist

669
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
Bias

670
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,960
Yeah because every time they updated everyone that's revises like

671
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,800
Hey if we don't do this by 2200 is it

672
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,920
It's going to wind up being the next reported like we have

673
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
6 years left

674
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,856
You what you'd look at that is like an optimism bias Alex would say that that's evidence

675
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
So

676
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,096
Cauliflower

677
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,960
This relates to a recent livestream that AOC was doing when she visited a community

678
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
Discuss issues about what

679
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,592
Environmental efforts

680
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Community garden

681
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,992
One of them she pointed out was the difficulty of growing crops that are traditionally used in their quiz

682
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
A community garden

683
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
She singles out Yucca is being a plant

684
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,184
Difficult to grow in urban environments cauliflower

685
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Which she just picked out asthma

686
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
Example of a vegetable

687
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:46,400
She wasn't even saying anything specifically about cauliflower cauliflower or something

688
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
It was a random example

689
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Of course

690
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,800
Example at Sebago

691
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Absolut Vodka

692
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
I think so

693
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,992
She said that it was of colonial

694
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
Call flowers

695
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Cauliflower has

696
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Colonial Lake

697
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
English introduced

698
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
22nd

699
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
T22

700
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
It wasn't

701
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
AOC choked all flowers an example of a crop

702
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
These communities

703
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
Involved with cultural

704
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Soda popular is

705
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
The big city community garden

706
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Where space is limited

707
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,504
I'm not entirely sure that's fully accurate of cauliflower

708
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Right shows cauliflower as an example

709
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
Possibly just

710
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
Because she had seen it at a community garden that you can visit

711
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
That is such one of those blind spots that I would

712
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Never have thought of because

713
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Cuz it never even

714
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Comes into my life

715
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
Plant

716
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Community garden

717
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,968
Like why would you just play at some random ass 85th super difficult

718
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,856
Space is limited

719
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
An example of colonial approach to Environmental

720
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Of course response to this other right

721
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
She's stupid and that she's calling cauliflower

722
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
But in reality what she's talking about is a pretty important

723
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Real issue

724
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,056
As a paper published in 2009 by the sustainability Research Institute

725
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
Around the world colonialism became synonymous with the alienation of people from their land and resources

726
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,296
Colonize people became from their resources

727
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Largely because the colonizing

728
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Powers did not fix

729
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
We trusted to Stewart over the land themselves

730
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
This is basically what you

731
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
You talkin about

732
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
Environmental projects

733
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Cultural context

734
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Because if they don't

735
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Colonialism

736
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Being portrayed as Environmental

737
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,984
Yeah you can disagree with her point if you want but if you

738
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Then you've got to wrestle with

739
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Town of scholarship on the intersection

740
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Conservationism

741
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
And Colonial

742
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
Especially when we're getting

743
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
Very similar

744
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
Here is what we should do to stop all of this

745
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
That can

746
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Boiled down to

747
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
If everybody lived like this

748
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,048
If everybody lives like us which for some people is culturally

749
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Absolutely

750
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
Make slime individual

751
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Yeah there you go

752
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
You know so

753
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,872
And Alex could argue this if you wanted to rub

754
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
The points of environmental colonialism

755
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Just to say that I am

756
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
It's because the goal isn't to tell the news

757
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Analysis

758
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,136
The goal is to portray your enemy

759
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
Eager to call things race

760
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
But even vegetables aren't safe

761
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
And of course the goal event for Alex

762
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,584
Defend himself from very accurate accusation

763
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
So there you go

764
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,776
Three things but Alex's used to characterize as an amazing why you fight so hard it gets what they're all bulshit

765
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,872
He has his own show he runs everything unlimited time on air

766
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
And this is what he brings

767
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
The table

768
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
To explain

769
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Our enemies

770
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Just bought

771
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
You got nothing

772
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Okay so

773
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Toy

774
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
So these aren't

775
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
And

776
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
So if they're not true

777
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
He knows they're not

778
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Then they can't be the reasons that hehe

779
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,984
What does imply there's got to be another reason

780
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Perhaps

781
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,080
One that he would rather not put out

782
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Instead obfuscate

783
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
These lies and bulshit

784
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Wonder what those are

785
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
Alex is really pissed off

786
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Cauliflower being called race

787
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
It makes a little

788
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
I just got to say

789
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
And the cauliflower comment

790
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,864
My favorite Judy Blume

791
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,944
Realized

792
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
Are the high priest over fighting racism

793
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
Smoke with racist

794
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Bought milk with races

795
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Sensitivity

796
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
It appears that they managed to trick the right person

797
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
And this guy

798
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,544
It began with legitimate not making videos

799
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
Richard Spencer in baked Alaska added milk

800
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,944
Push the hashtag Twitter

801
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
They were doing the same thing they've done a bunch

802
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
We saw it recently with a botched

803
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
The temperature for 10 to the actual hashtag

804
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,416
A symbol that was a white supremacist

805
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Troll sent journalist tips

806
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,304
Trying to get them to cover the story but none took the bait except for Mikhail Phelan

807
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Of the daily.

808
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,912
It distinctly Mikael Phelan was a writer for Infowars

809
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
But it's not rebranded

810
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:13,824
Is a tech writer it's a lie. And somehow is getting away with it it's crazy

811
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
Just obscure enough of an Infowars important you could still do this

812
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
So

813
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,160
That's a problem and that's why someone like me is important to exist in the world I guess

814
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Probably not too worried about me

815
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
This is the part of a larger strategy nationalist attempt to create innocuous

816
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Attached

817
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Easley post office

818
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
Is there ever called on it

819
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
We saw this with the Okay Hand

820
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,432
It was simultaneously a legitimate symbol being used by these extremist community

821
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
To signal to each other

822
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Are you serious it's just an okay sign

823
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
They could respond to any

824
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
No criticism

825
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
And then the

826
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,048
Ultimately it doesn't matter if the okay sign as a gesture of Because by it

827
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
It's usage

828
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Thursday

829
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
Going on

830
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
The accusation that the left thing

831
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Milk is racist

832
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
It was a manufacturer campaign took make the last

833
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
And accusations of racism look Baseline

834
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
Because at the

835
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
Creative spirits that races

836
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Really just

837
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,392
That's the motivation behind it

838
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
The phucstyx

839
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,608
Seriously there's only one group

840
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Yeah yeah

841
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
0 group

842
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Anyone still peddling with narrative in 2019

843
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,175
Dudley trying to signal to their base of neo-nazis and white nationalists

844
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
In on the joke

845
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,527
Either way it doesn't look good that Alex is still on

846
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:05,183
Unfortunately those white supremacist or we're actually onto something with their stunts campaign

847
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,023
Hazard

848
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Supposed

849
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,631
The attempts to make milk a racist meme or supposed to be

850
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
His article discusses a book called nature

851
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,871
Perfect food how milk became America's drink

852
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Which does seem to argue that it's very

853
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
Is the early advertising campaigns for the national Dairy Council

854
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Explicitly

855
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:36,159
In the early 1900s the national Dairy Council marketed milk by saying things like quote

856
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
People who have an appreciation

857
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
For art literature and music

858
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,559
Court Progressive and science at every activity

859
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,399
Are the people who have used liberal amounts of milk and its products

860
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,983
The book goes on to say quote by declaring milk perfect

861
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
White northern European

862
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Announce their own perfection

863
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
In the 1930s

864
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,967
An agricultural history of New York's quote

865
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
A casual look at the races of people

866
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
Seems at to show that those using much milk

867
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Are the strongest

868
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Just physically and mentally

869
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,927
And the most of the people of the world

870
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
Of all Races to Aryan seem to have been the heavy

871
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,559
Drinkers of milk and the greatest users of butter in

872
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,679
Impark account for the quick and high development of this division of human being

873
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,055
Louis Pasteur is the patron saint of the White Castle

874
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
I believe

875
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,967
Is on the Rushmore this could be called

876
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,295
Is because the marketing was specifically designed around the idea that there was a

877
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
Association between drinking milk

878
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Convene better people

879
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,207
By Andrea freemen of the University of Hawaii School of Law

880
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Although

881
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,559
Statistics very 7% of African-American adults

882
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
45% of African-American children

883
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
74% of Mexico

884
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
Kingsborough Community

885
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,287
98% of Southeast Asian percent of Asian Americans

886
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Cannot Digest

887
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
A large number of non-white communities are lactose

888
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,711
Intolerance Market something

889
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Naturally better people

890
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,855
Name something that only white people can consistently what you doing is kind of racist

891
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
It's in there

892
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
Couple of steps

893
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
It's more than you're used to seeing with

894
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,423
Like you got to know

895
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Is are lactose

896
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
Intolerant you got to have a

897
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Beretta

898
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Information order really

899
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
Milk for how races

900
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
And now that I do

901
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,319
Justin like liking milk isn't racist but that doesn't mean you can't look at the history of it

902
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,487
Lactose intolerant is even kind of messed up

903
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Using that framing makes

904
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,607
Sima being intolerant to lactose

905
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Option as opposed

906
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,447
Norm when in reality quotes

907
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,263
Percentage of individuals from all communities

908
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,407
With the exception of Scandinavian and northern European white did not retain the enzyme lactase

909
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
Northern Europeans and Scandinavians developed this enzyme as a response to living in climates hostile to creating something

910
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Sustainable food source

911
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Which compelled them to resort to

912
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
To drinking their herds milk

913
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
So it's something that is specific to communicate

914
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,815
Abundance of life

915
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Sister somehow

916
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,287
Deficiency

917
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
How to change

918
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
A mutation

919
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
You guys lived in the dumbest f****** place to live and then you're making us feel bad for it

920
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,415
None of it's wrong but

921
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
Do you take that

922
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Is even somehow making it

923
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
A negative

924
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,655
This is vexing.

925
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:04,031
Texting episodes

926
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
There is a reality

927
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Racist history in the milking.

928
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,063
You being tricked by or

929
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
Any criticism of racism look suspicious

930
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,695
The goal here was to provide a response

931
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,535
The next time you are one of your races

932
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
You can pull out the oh yeah Grace it's like milk is racist

933
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
It's an attempt at building

934
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,703
Counter-narrative at 100% only exist

935
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
To defend

936
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,519
Accurate criticisms of race

937
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
This is what Alex does

938
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
It's what his show exist

939
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
To do

940
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,943
Search be all that surprising

941
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
Cauliflower we got

942
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Metallica

943
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
I just got to say

944
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,255
Triggered by this conversation about food

945
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:01,119
Or something he starts yelling about corn if he will taking corn is ready

946
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
South America

947
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:10,335
So anyway

948
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Who cares

949
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
It's easy to grow its nutritious

950
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,783
How do you say it's racist

951
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Everything

952
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
Cauliflower

953
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Is just

954
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,143
He's real mad

955
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
The problem with that presentation

956
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
The way you feel

957
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Tell if he

958
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Do you think that mockingly or if

959
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,639
He really means that everything hinges on fighting back against

960
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
What's this

961
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,455
Accusation the cauliflower is racist

962
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Because

963
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
Either could be something I I could

964
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
See it being

965
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
Almost like a wave function

966
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Through each word as

967
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
Saying it what he's

968
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
As he's going through

969
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,399
It all and I mean

970
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
Now that is actually a joke

971
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
In doing this podcast

972
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,943
We Are embodying The Observer paradox

973
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,599
If Alex just yells it simultaneously a joke and serious at the same time but once discuss

974
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
It no longer exists

975
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
Thing that he said of like

976
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,047
Even if it did come from Europe

977
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Who cares

978
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
That is such that

979
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Colonialist mindset

980
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
You should

981
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Immense

982
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
William Porter

983
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
Because it is

984
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
Coming from a different phone

985
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
You have to be aware of because this

986
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
Glorious is just like

987
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,527
America

988
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087
Like that concept is

989
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
If you

990
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Like I

991
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Someday

992
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
It might be starling

993
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
I can't remember

994
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
There was a guy who was so upset

995
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Shakespeare

996
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
Can you believe that

997
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
Every bird mentioned

998
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Shakespeare

999
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Should be on

1000
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
All the

1001
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,431
So he brought starlings he ratted destroyed every

1002
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
Competitor

1003
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
A monstrous

1004
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Nightmares

1005
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Did the

1006
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
Did the

1007
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Never bring up

1008
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Cassowaries

1009
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
I do not believe he did

1010
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,279
God

1011
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
Murder murder

1012
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
Alex

1013
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Complains about

1014
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
The Daily Beast writing an article about it

1015
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Complains

1016
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
About people who are

1017
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Suing him

1018
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Cutting me up

1019
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,991
How to shut me down

1020
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
Again

1021
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
He almost admitted

1022
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
In a deposition

1023
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
He's playing

1024
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Your lawyer said it

1025
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,799
You understand the level of organized defeat buddy

1026
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,663
It's all formulaically written it's all put out

1027
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
Lying

1028
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
The Easter special will be back on though

1029
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
Undoubtedly next week

1030
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
So

1031
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,127
Convenient that all of the people who are

1032
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Critiquing Alex

1033
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
For the things of it

1034
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,063
Are also just happened to be wanting to destroy this country and all of his

1035
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
Listeners family

1036
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
It seems

1037
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
He's so lucky that the people who are personally going to

1038
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
To jeopardize his

1039
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,327
Money are also enemies of the Republic

1040
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
You know it's

1041
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
It's just

1042
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,423
It's really

1043
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
It really makes it so

1044
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,775
Your content on the show

1045
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Really worked

1046
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
2

1047
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
Defend yourself from

1048
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,247
Lawsuits

1049
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
I like like the way

1050
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
You are getting covered

1051
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
And so

1052
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,463
Conveniently it also happened that they were Adam

1053
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,935
Criticize you know what it's like everybody win

1054
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
You know what it is

1055
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
Dance to hate anyone who criticizes

1056
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
Yep that's number one

1057
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
And then number two it makes

1058
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
Too so much of the content of Ashokan

1059
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,759
Sort of Loki be about him being sued without him having to say things

1060
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
Yeah that will like end up

1061
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
Another lawsuit if he attaches the idea of all of these globalists and all these anime

1062
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,023
Needs of America they are the ones who are coming after him

1063
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
It makes it very easy for his

1064
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,631
To build up that hatred of

1065
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,423
The people who are coming after him

1066
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Through his

1067
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
Long rambling diatribes about the globalist

1068
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
Translator

1069
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Speaking of sneaky

1070
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,711
Alex has his lawyer back on the show

1071
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,527
He has also Jim hoft from Gateway pundit

1072
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
But it's kind of boring

1073
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
He's back on the show

1074
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,255
He is boring also

1075
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
He does say

1076
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,119
This should scare you to hear a lawyer say

1077
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
Beautiful defense

1078
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
Of tyranny anyways

1079
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
Is not obstruction of justice

1080
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
It is just

1081
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
And that's what President Trump did

1082
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,735
So

1083
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
Slippery slope

1084
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Hoboy

1085
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
That's travel

1086
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
I mean

1087
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
It does seem like that make

1088
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
A certain kind

1089
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
In this context

1090
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
It means that

1091
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Anybody who

1092
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Criticize

1093
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
Accountable for his actions

1094
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,343
Instead it's a coup Ono crime can be committed

1095
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,927
In defense of this nation

1096
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
Jail the people

1097
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Who haven't got

1098
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,327
Maybe you should hard labor camp

1099
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:00,447
Lee's globalist 24-hours everybody who

1100
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
All of these arguments

1101
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Sorry service

1102
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
Of creating

1103
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,943
And environment where power can be abused

1104
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,503
Did Alex's pretended to be against result f******

1105
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Career

1106
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,831
Is ridiculous

1107
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:23,231
So not too long

1108
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Talk about how we can't

1109
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Sitting up with

1110
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,119
Text Machinery terrible

1111
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Sleep apnea and his neck

1112
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Super thick

1113
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
45% oxygen

1114
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
Next clip

1115
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:42,431
And then by the way guys we haven't resisted spoilers about Game of Thrones but now Alex

1116
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,247
Spoil Game of Thrones

1117
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
White supremacist

1118
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
Whatever

1119
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,391
I warn you ahead of time but it's not like we could ignore this

1120
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,463
Because he has some analysis of it.

1121
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,279
I think you might have missed the point

1122
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,399
I am completely honest

1123
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,711
Articles about

1124
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
Successful will cause the Civil War

1125
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Doesn't just stop at

1126
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,503
Turn around looking at you

1127
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,583
Electrochemical

1128
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,399
We're not just seeing with with the circle five senses

1129
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,519
Inherently

1130
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:19,199
Crossroads

1131
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
Most popular shows

1132
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,743
You really believe that they are ending the last couple of episodes were going to be very popular

1133
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,839
The most unpopular ending of a series in invasive

1134
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
Peanuts TV history

1135
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
How did that happen

1136
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,799
They presume that people would find a normal okay within the range of acceptable conduct

1137
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,615
For someone to go kill a bunch of innocent women and children

1138
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
Just because they were mad that day

1139
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
Wait so

1140
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
Is his

1141
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,319
Contention that the writers

1142
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Thinking that everybody would be

1143
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Super stoked

1144
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
That Danny

1145
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
Honey kills everybody

1146
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,999
Or is he saying that the people

1147
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
The episode

1148
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,119
Because they think it was actually a good idea

1149
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
And didn't like

1150
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Seeing her retribution at

1151
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
Yeah that's that's a great question

1152
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
I'm not entirely sure

1153
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Barnes

1154
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Isn't

1155
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Really

1156
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
All that clear

1157
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
In his in his

1158
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
Perspective

1159
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
Alex themes

1160
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
To think that it was

1161
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Predictive

1162
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Program

1163
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,903
Conservative witches

1164
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,207
A real snowflake

1165
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
Just self victim

1166
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,815
Yeah Status claiming

1167
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,887
But

1168
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
Interesting

1169
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Terms of how people

1170
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
But more interesting to me is that both of them are apparently psychic

1171
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
Alex is a twice

1172
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:03,135
Alex literally said we talked about this off-air it's not mumbo jumbo

1173
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Got Alex

1174
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,303
Tell the story about when he was younger

1175
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
He is family had a land grant

1176
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
And so they had like

1177
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,167
Hundred Acre

1178
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:21,055
Batwoman

1179
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Auntie be like shooting vermin

1180
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
And now varmints

1181
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
He had a

1182
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,991
Something was watching

1183
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
I looked over

1184
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
I saw a deer

1185
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
That wasn't what we

1186
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
What's triggering my Spidey Sense

1187
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
They looked over

1188
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:44,351
And then he looked closer and he saw the eyes and once the eye is about Ryan ran away

1189
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,935
Okay well then Table stores

1190
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983
I think he's right

1191
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
Tried everything

1192
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
Possible

1193
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
It's within the realm of

1194
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Stories that could have happened

1195
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,455
Alex did have a lot of laughs

1196
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
It wouldn't be all that crazy

1197
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
If you was walking around

1198
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
It got real lucky

1199
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,047
Well it's at memorability thing

1200
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
There's hundreds and

1201
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,935
That you had a sense that something was bad

1202
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
You don't remember any of those times

1203
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
You do remember when

1204
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,639
It sticks out your mind because it's the Fulfillment of that

1205
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,431
Betty White

1206
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:37,087
Which is great I thought that was loose talk but in a little bit we're going to find out that Robert

1207
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
Does Mankey look like

1208
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
Yeah

1209
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Phuket jobs

1210
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,023
Last scorpion from the 30

1211
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Alex

1212
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Compass point recently

1213
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
To quit

1214
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
That's red that's worth

1215
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Pointing out

1216
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,871
Intuit again talking about how

1217
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,943
Feels really want to do this anymore never really did wanted to be a farmer

1218
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,783
25 years

1219
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,575
That literally wants to stop

1220
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,135
I'll be completely honest with the Western

1221
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
There's a big part of me

1222
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
That

1223
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:20,351
I didn't get into this from some narcissistic perspective that would be on TV I didn't want to be on TV I want to be a farmer or Rancher

1224
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,079
He wants to

1225
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:41,855
That you got Trump elected say no this broadcast worldwide and you promoting it has spread

1226
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
Nationalist populist

1227
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
Capitalist ideas

1228
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
You are

1229
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,143
We need the lister's that haven't bought product

1230
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:57,983
See how great they are

1231
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,359
I want to be a farmer

1232
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
Look we've had a lot of fun with

1233
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
Add pivots in the past but that was one of us

1234
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Smoothest

1235
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:15,135
I've heard in a long time slowed a little bit

1236
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
Kind of

1237
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
Probably not

1238
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,559
Accurate I'm sure Alex is always been paranoid about guns

1239
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,911
In other points in a career I'm positive you would have said that Waco

1240
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Overtly

1241
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,567
Like to be involved

1242
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
Get active

1243
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,895
His campaign to help rebuild

1244
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
The church

1245
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
In Waco

1246
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,015
That was much more foundational interested

1247
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
Starting as media career

1248
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,391
Then we're going to take 25 years ago

1249
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,863
If you say Waco now people are going

1250
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
React to different

1251
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,191
Then if not his audience

1252
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
That's fair.

1253
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,775
I think it's more just that like everything is

1254
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,567
Become so much about guns

1255
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
That in order for it to make sense

1256
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Then that has

1257
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,199
To be the root of why you're doing what

1258
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
What you do

1259
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,551
You know you can repackage Waco is being

1260
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
About Gunslinger

1261
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,159
What's that ostensibly

1262
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,767
So in this next clip we get into the 31st

1263
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,351
Man I got bad news about the gas line up on the show

1264
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
Tiger house Alex Jones

1265
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
4 hours

1266
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,495
Robert Barnes shoes

1267
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
Great lawyer and release

1268
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,663
H and I will

1269
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
Open the bomb shop on Alta Vista

1270
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,759
He opens the phone

1271
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
Like 10 minutes till he's done

1272
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Again

1273
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
He's on all the time now

1274
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
EasyBib

1275
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
I had this thought

1276
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:09,311
I don't know I can obviously can't prove that

1277
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Does paying him with a

1278
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,943
Exposure or something like that.

1279
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,575
Alex is like

1280
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,879
Either that or he's like

1281
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,207
He's gradually just like everybody else in his life is

1282
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:32,351
Stepping away from him but it's possible.

1283
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Things that make sense

1284
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
This would be a time when

1285
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,519
Maybe on a bunch but also

1286
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
Happen like

1287
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,663
Robinul come in town for a weekend

1288
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,711
It's it's strange cuz he doesn't

1289
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Really have that much

1290
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,087
Bring the table Rogan's lawyer isn't showing up on rug

1291
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,879
No

1292
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
That's awesome

1293
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Yeah I think that the most

1294
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Likely

1295
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,767
Exclamation

1296
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Static level

1297
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
That is just

1298
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:10,239
Hanging out on air with someone he literally pays to defend him

1299
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:15,871
I don't think it's probably a bad sign

1300
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
Just kind of this Hotshot lawyer

1301
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,943
Do the ascended right-wing fast

1302
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
Community

1303
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
He was a lawyer for the Covent

1304
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,879
Popping up on Alex's show was a guest on a recent episode of Dave Rubin

1305
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,159
36B on Fox

1306
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
Snooze a little bit pretty regularly

1307
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
He has popped up on Fox News

1308
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
Given all this

1309
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,631
Maybe I should look into him a little bit more I kind of gave him the passes

1310
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,495
Opportunistic lawyer brand

1311
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
You think so I think so

1312
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,615
So I read his bio on his website

1313
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
What's further into this guy

1314
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:55,807
Once established in a law and business advisory practice

1315
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,159
California is keen understanding of persuasion patterns

1316
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,951
It was lucrative side business

1317
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,487
Sports and political betting

1318
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,839
So okay we have a

1319
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:13,471
Lawyer to set up a gambling

1320
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,823
Which doesn't sound at all how you might politely describe the mob

1321
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,199
They used a lot of persuasion their gambling winnings

1322
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,927
Are political gambling

1323
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Turns out

1324
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,487
He better win the election

1325
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
Ended up winning

1326
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,559
70 thousand Euros

1327
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
That's right

1328
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,983
Is prices in Euros because betting on presidential electric vehicle in the US

1329
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:53,407
You would like a half million dollars. Elections

1330
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Like

1331
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
The real weird thing

1332
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,599
Now for him to be

1333
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,415
Actively involved in political

1334
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,815
Activities for Trump when he made half a billion dollars gambling on an election

1335
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,215
Barnes and Barnes

1336
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,055
His bio goes on to say quote Barnes is now working for the rights

1337
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,103
Of the underdog

1338
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,431
Fortune-telling strategy in Polish

1339
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
The candidates

1340
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,015
Of the populist persuasion

1341
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,551
I think that that means

1342
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,855
You literally

1343
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,415
Mystical abilities

1344
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:43,071
Which doesn't sound at all like something

1345
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,447
Sorry 2004

1346
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,007
Tax protest against the IRA

1347
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,335
Joe Bannister here of Alex's for a really long time

1348
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,663
I find it very difficult to imagine that Alex wouldn't have known

1349
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,479
Cool Joe Bannister lawyer

1350
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,295
There's possibility that he's known this dude for 15

1351
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Yeah for sure I don't know that to be

1352
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,415
But the fact that he was

1353
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,767
Mr. Bean

1354
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
Yeah I'm sure

1355
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,935
In 2008 Robert Barnes represented Girls Gone Wild Creator Joe Francis on tax evasion charges

1356
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:24,543
Well you did for a little while but ultimately left this is cancelled which Francis that quote

1357
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,895
The only reason they wanted me as a client was to mooch off me and open up an LA office

1358
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
There's a Paris Hilton of lawyers

1359
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
Just to be famous not to do any

1360
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,831
Even when he's criticizing a monster that guy still a

1361
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Yeah

1362
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
Cassandra Fairbanks

1363
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
When she was trying to sue a reporter for

1364
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
Profusion

1365
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
Image of Fairbanks

1366
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,631
Okay

1367
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
Which the reporter caption does a white power

1368
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,287
This is exactly why the trolls started doing that

1369
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,847
Debate people into responding

1370
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,967
It's a publicity trap and the lawyer Fairbanks. The representer was Robert f****** Barn

1371
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,783
Fusion rightly responded

1372
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Complete quote is clearly frivolous

1373
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,391
The suit is an obvious publicity stunt another attempt

1374
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
Intimidate reporters who

1375
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,951
Scrutinize the extreme-right

1376
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:17,535
Which is correct barnes's into that

1377
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,607
In June 2018 the lawsuit was thrown out because of course

1378
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,959
In 28 Chuck Johnson hired Barnes to represent

1379
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
Twitter forgot when they kicked him off

1380
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
After he hit that threatened to

1381
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,359
DeRay McKesson

1382
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,383
I don't know why

1383
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
They

1384
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,247
So you got like a real interesting

1385
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,551
Real thread through

1386
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
Barnes's career

1387
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
Outside

1388
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,671
Interesting cases

1389
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:50,559
Representative Ralph

1390
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,119
Why do

1391
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,679
He has other interests

1392
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,215
History of some of those like

1393
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
Celebrity client

1394
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
Stuff of like

1395
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,359
Licitly working

1396
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
Right-wing figure

1397
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,759
Little bit like Avon Barksdale

1398
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:14,879
Like I like that whole guy they have on retainer of just like hey

1399
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:18,719
If any of our guys goes to goes to prison you're the one represent

1400
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
Go to the position he's trying to

1401
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,607
Claim

1402
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
Community

1403
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,751
I think it's going to blow up in his face

1404
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,823
Because of Alex

1405
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Wise enough

1406
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,127
To avoid the pitfalls

1407
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,223
I don't think he is going on this show a lot

1408
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Classic

1409
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:48,927
It's like a shortcut that has a trapdoor you get there safe

1410
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:52,767
Cut you're going to fall through too much

1411
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
Especially too much bad

1412
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,143
The f****** show 3 times in a week

1413
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
You're right that's crazy

1414
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
So Alex

1415
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Complain here in this neck

1416
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,567
Text clip before Barnes shows up

1417
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,847
About how blue City

1418
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Falling apart

1419
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:08,895
Course

1420
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:13,759
We know cuz we've listened out of the show before it says it all the f****** time

1421
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
Every blue

1422
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
In the country

1423
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,695
It's not just collapsing into typhoid

1424
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
And leprosy

1425
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,279
Rogers music

1426
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,839
And literally hundreds of other diseases

1427
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,167
Hundred into homelessness

1428
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,983
Drug abuse needles

1429
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:38,079
With a cherry on top of men dress as women

1430
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,151
Running around at public events with small children

1431
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Cherry on top

1432
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible

1433
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
Archaeologists think so

1434
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
Okay but there

1435
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
Butter

1436
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,047
What's your point of order

1437
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
People people

1438
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,119
Referencing Sodom and Gomorrah

1439
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Just as

1440
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
The place

1441
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,727
Like there's a larger context around it

1442
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
But it doesn't matter if the

1443
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,775
The place is real

1444
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:11,871
So

1445
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,015
The store

1446
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
The claim that they've been

1447
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,511
Discovered the archeological sites were Sodom and Gomorrah

1448
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
Each time they're claimed

1449
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
Scrutinized and found to be

1450
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:35,423
We flawed Ito also I would imagine

1451
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,727
That a lot of those guys share one

1452
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
They're looking for Sodom and Gomorrah

1453
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
For a very specific

1454
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,943
I strongly disagree cuz I think the archaeological

1455
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Curiosity

1456
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
Is very strong

1457
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:55,391
Heinrich schliemann

1458
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,999
I don't think anyone's trying to prove anything by archaeology

1459
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:07,423
No Hayward

1460
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,799
Being the person

1461
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,591
Take your name Moana

1462
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,639
Imagine

1463
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Discover

1464
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
Sodom

1465
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,319
I suppose I was leaning towards the people who would then

1466
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
Exploited immediately after

1467
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:31,743
Proposed locations for Sodom

1468
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,863
Which

1469
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,935
Geographically possibly where was

1470
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:46,335
Unfortunately

1471
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:51,199
But if that site is accepted as. I'm finna completely rewriting invalidates except

1472
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
Biblical dates for the

1473
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,831
Similar problems pop up graphic location

1474
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,951
Alex is kind of right as much as enterprising archaeology

1475
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,791
Just looking to make a name for themselves

1476
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,839
Scholarly community

1477
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Takes a more measured approach

1478
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,471
Take me to position to take

1479
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
Also

1480
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,847
I don't think any archaeologist who believe the story of Sodom and Gomorrah literally

1481
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
I would suspect most of them would say that if the

1482
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:27,551
The place was real there's any truth to the story it's a metaphorical retelling of a natural disaster that happened it wiped out of town

1483
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
It's an element of oral tradition

1484
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Scapegoating

1485
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,183
We talked a little bit about this when I was brought up ASAP

1486
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
America

1487
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,559
You tell a story about two cities destroyed by a terrible earthquake or some

1488
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
You need to have it make sense

1489
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,399
So when oral tradition you introduce an element

1490
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
Divine retribution

1491
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
The kasbah

1492
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,215
Instead of CityWalk

1493
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,055
And that way you also enforce cultural norms and expectations

1494
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,359
Through the telling of the story

1495
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,807
Don't do any

1496
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Complete

1497
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,975
Just don't agree that's out of my borrowed were real places based on

1498
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,255
Available

1499
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Alex

1500
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
Just doing that

1501
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
I guess

1502
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Be a dick

1503
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
Turn on Trump

1504
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
And Kushner

1505
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,847
This is because losses come out

1506
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
The kushners going to Bilderberg

1507
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,455
This is my problem

1508
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
With your narrative

1509
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,015
Yeah but Alex

1510
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,319
It's cool unless Kushner

1511
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,367
Circe

1512
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
And

1513
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,255
I don't think he had me Wildfire but

1514
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
The thing is

1515
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
With Alex

1516
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,119
He's already done this

1517
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,191
Yeah Trump went to Davos already

1518
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,495
Worked out how to play this game

1519
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
Of course it's a den of globalist

1520
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:57,919
Yeah but it's cool and replace

1521
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:01,503
He's responding to criticisms that a lot of people have been throwing at

1522
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
The kushners going

1523
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Two

1524
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,623
In order to

1525
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
Say like hey this is

1526
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,183
The problem

1527
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,487
He makes it clear that is there every

1528
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Is a

1529
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
Or if there was

1530
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
He would f******

1531
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Turn on that

1532
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,631
I would like to point out it happens

1533
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
6 times already

1534
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,191
This is me

1535
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,055
Anything out of touch

1536
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,943
Shoppers value

1537
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,503
Turn on them

1538
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,807
Pitbull

1539
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
Flash

1540
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,047
Everybody should just relax

1541
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,351
You're conquering Bilderberg right now

1542
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Okay

1543
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Fair enough

1544
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
What

1545
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
Never assume the outcome

1546
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Before the

1547
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
Is the experiment Kushner going to Bilderberg

1548
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:07,551
An experiment that's just a dude going to a meeting

1549
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Not everything

1550
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
The experiment is

1551
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:15,231
What would it take for somebody to turn on Trump

1552
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,791
So yeah it's not going to happen

1553
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Because you're not go

1554
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,423
We've seen

1555
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,263
Of course

1556
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Cool

1557
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
Whatever man

1558
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,943
So you remember earlier I was talking about the idea of

1559
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,711
This

1560
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Purge

1561
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:40,319
That people were pushing for in the beginning early days of trump

1562
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,623
How all of these

1563
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
These people in the right wing

1564
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,951
Media including Alex

1565
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
And people who are more associated with him than they are now who doesn't come around anymore

1566
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,423
Images don't show up in their photograph

1567
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,239
I compare that to

1568
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,543
Specifically in intentionally

1569
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:04,383
The idea of this recent Purge that Kim Jong-kook

1570
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,175
Yeah

1571
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:09,759
For Alex to bring back Robert

1572
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,831
First episode enzyme talk about that Purge

1573
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:14,879
Cool Whip

1574
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,487
We know 60 years of this

1575
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,263
Is there killing in prison everybody who he blamed for it

1576
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,359
But what

1577
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759
The president of the

1578
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,367
He said they taunt the president called

1579
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Absolutely

1580
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:53,535
Is a really f***** up way to rationalize and be like later

1581
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,351
Either killed or

1582
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,167
It's definitely not the healthiest way to go about

1583
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,703
Stupid

1584
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,127
Oh boy

1585
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,943
Look

1586
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,991
If I had my druthers

1587
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,039
It is kind of you got to give it to him

1588
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:22,207
He wants to move forward

1589
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:27,583
This is a real strategic move on his part

1590
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
Support at

1591
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,215
Was

1592
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
One of the most

1593
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Disjointed

1594
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
Like ideas

1595
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,591
I've heard come out of the lawyers

1596
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Let alone

1597
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Against on Alex Jones

1598
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
It's delusional

1599
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
First of all

1600
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
VI

1601
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
Like what the North Korean

1602
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,415
Press

1603
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,743
Is that the idea

1604
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
For The Purge

1605
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,351
Was that

1606
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
These people didn't

1607
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
Understand us

1608
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
Intentions

1609
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,543
There was an expectation.

1610
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,335
Complete denuclearization

1611
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
It doesn't

1612
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,431
I'm like The Purge

1613
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Was

1614
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Particularly

1615
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,039
To get more

1616
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,599
No

1617
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
More

1618
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
Away from

1619
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
1 rum

1620
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
That should have been pushing for

1621
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,047
So it seems like this is a step backwards

1622
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:34,399
Alex Jones are willing to go on

1623
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,959
Did a purging of government officials

1624
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,519
In the wake of a not going great

1625
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:45,407
What is a good sign

1626
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:51,551
You know a lot of people do meteors crashing into the Earth

1627
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,623
To see all that fire first

1628
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
It's great

1629
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,183
That's what does a wild thought

1630
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,767
There's a lot of times that I

1631
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Just think like

1632
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,911
You guys are really going for it and that's one of them that's really going for it

1633
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,983
Trying to reclaim

1634
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,287
Kim Jeong Hoon

1635
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
Persian people

1636
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,664
Deposit paperwork for nationalism

1637
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
In-N-Out f*****-up

1638
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,712
Man

1639
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,248
You don't

1640
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
Barnes really

1641
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
Define lawyer

1642
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
It'll because bro

1643
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,392
They're presented as being rational

1644
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Intelligent people

1645
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,232
When was like the rest of us

1646
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Speaking of crazy

1647
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
Robert Barnes

1648
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,728
There's a story going around

1649
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,032
About some

1650
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,080
That are supposed to be released I believe

1651
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,104
2027

1652
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,896
Of Martin Luther King

1653
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
In a positive light

1654
01:20:55,552 --> 01:21:01,696
Probably I don't know enough about it and Reporting on it that I

1655
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,768
I was looking at was secondhand

1656
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,864
Seems I'm in the archives

1657
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,912
Record this

1658
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,728
But I do have a position on it in terms of like

1659
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
I don't think that anyone is

1660
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,568
Trying to get Martin Luther King

1661
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
You know what I mean

1662
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,248
Because they did

1663
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
I mean the kids

1664
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,184
You make a point

1665
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,976
Nvs PW

1666
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,512
Aren't trying to

1667
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,560
Cancel Martin Luther King with

1668
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Is Taco

1669
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,680
That seems to be what Alex believes though

1670
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
And Alex Robert Barnes

1671
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,496
Have a conversation

1672
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,032
Can about the cancel

1673
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,568
Of Martin Luther King

1674
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,872
Write about why the left

1675
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
Just turned on him

1676
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,784
Alexander Barnes

1677
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
I don't either

1678
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:04,416
I don't recall turning on my lip

1679
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,952
Either but I guess

1680
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,744
Schnauzer Alexandra

1681
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,608
To find out why

1682
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:17,472
So this is what unique about Martin Luther King

1683
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,824
Get your name

1684
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,384
It was I'm an American

1685
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
Absolutely

1686
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
That actually unifying figure

1687
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:32,576
Across classes across races and he was appealing to the deepest part of Americana

1688
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
So

1689
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,696
He said that

1690
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,232
Is so mixed with

1691
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
Corrected

1692
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,560
In the right and wrong way

1693
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,608
Simultaneously

1694
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Ferret

1695
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
It's a little while

1696
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,008
Episode

1697
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
Beck's probably

1698
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:56,384
Is openly trying to discredit Martin Luther King

1699
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,176
Exactly

1700
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,712
Crazy the left is God

1701
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,760
Teen is probably the biggest threat

1702
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,904
Message

1703
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Because because

1704
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,560
They have to take him out because he was a uniter

1705
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,864
Now if I were to make a complete

1706
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,776
Hoover

1707
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:37,856
Maybe describe right maybe there's not enough contact from Vuclip

1708
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,208
These tapes there

1709
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,024
About the bike

1710
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,424
To cancel Martin Luther King

1711
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,824
But I wanted to point out a few things

1712
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,664
Alex and Barnes are intentionally Luther King jr.

1713
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,712
Take me to hundred percent sure

1714
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:08,064
That should Alex have been active in the sixties would have been on the side of those calling for King

1715
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,160
In 1952 Martin Luther King Road quote

1716
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,232
I'm much more socialistic in my economic theories and Capitol

1717
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
Capitalism has outlived its usefulness

1718
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
A 19-6

1719
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:24,448
67 Martin Luther King literally gave a speech

1720
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,752
At Riverside Church in positive

1721
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:33,152
Private property rights were not a primary concern

1722
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,224
Motives and property rights are considered

1723
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,600
The giant Triplets of racism materialism and militarism are incapable of being calm

1724
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,440
She's the only thing standing in between the left and Victory

1725
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,536
In his final book where do we go from here

1726
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
For guaranteed

1727
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:55,168
All amendments regarding economic equality and increasing public housing

1728
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,240
He expressed his support for job guarantees and Universal Health

1729
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,384
He literally called for redistribution of wealth darling of the right

1730
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,688
Because of his inclusive message

1731
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:12,064
What Alex Robert Barnes are doing here is engaging in whitewashing of Martin Luther King's life and Legacy

1732
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,112
He wasn't uniter absolutely

1733
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,976
He was trying to unite people for a goal that these two Dum Dums would have fought tooth-and-nail against

1734
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,328
You think Alex Jones would have heard him literally called for reparations

1735
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
You think Alex Jones would have read the letter from the Birmingham Jail where he said that moderate whites maybe more of an impediment to civil rights than

1736
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,592
Clan

1737
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,920
All of Alex's guides and inspirations

1738
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:41,248
Strictly opposed to Martin Luther King when he was actually alive

1739
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,904
Alex's favorite book none dare call it conspiracy was written by Gary Allan

1740
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
Who was I f****** segregation

1741
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,768
Alex's favorite nontron politician of all time

1742
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:56,096
Was explicitly against the Civil Rights Act

1743
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,888
It's true

1744
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,448
Number of libertarian

1745
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Yeah my point is this

1746
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:06,592
You can say that Martin Luther King was a uniter all you want that's totally cool

1747
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,152
What bars are doing here however is

1748
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,176
Stealing Martin Luther King

1749
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
King's Legacy from him

1750
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
And imagining that the some possible world exist

1751
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:17,088
Were they would have been in that very small percentage of the population

1752
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,392
Martin Luther King when he was still alive

1753
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
This is a pathetic and disgusting

1754
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,976
Display just about ready to

1755
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,792
Expecting these couple of dicks

1756
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Tire repair

1757
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
Looking party

1758
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,520
I mean it is one of

1759
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Better B

1760
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,408
The idea that every year white people add another hundred

1761
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
From the day

1762
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
Yeah you know like that

1763
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,320
Everyday Martin Luther King Jr's been dead we can't

1764
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,368
Take a little bit away from what he was

1765
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:54,720
To do and then just really oh he was a symbol of American

1766
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,024
You forgot to

1767
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,424
Pretends that like all the stuff he screams about the globalist about aren't like very aligned with stuff today

1768
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,288
Go fuc yourself Alex globalist

1769
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
You dumb

1770
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,848
Prick

1771
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,664
Take a note is because he was uniting a lot of people

1772
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
In order to fight against people

1773
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,880
People who are engaged

1774
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,160
You are

1775
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,720
So

1776
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
From what I understand

1777
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,352
That are to be released

1778
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,680
Are they have to do with mistreatment of women

1779
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,520
It's complicated

1780
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,824
That is not playing today

1781
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
Disgusted

1782
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
It's something that you can't

1783
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
You can't just ignore the

1784
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
These bad parts

1785
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,504
Important

1786
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,808
And it doesn't mean that you have to

1787
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,624
Say

1788
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
You have to wrestle with those

1789
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,816
And it's interesting that Alex wrestles with that

1790
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
Specific element

1791
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
Because I think he goes the

1792
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,448
I think you get a glimpse into how his brain works here

1793
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
Is that

1794
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,056
Somehow

1795
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,184
What county is Duvall in in

1796
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,000
Perfect

1797
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,888
Exactly

1798
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,752
Martin Luther King was the Harvey Weinstein of History

1799
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,360
That is ridiculous.

1800
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Because

1801
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,968
What king said was true

1802
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,856
Whether what they're saying about the throttle body

1803
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,904
It just makes me want to anymore

1804
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,536
First I believe your

1805
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
Discussing

1806
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:10,144
Which which wood is the proof

1807
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
So they do have

1808
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
Presumably

1809
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,032
I'd also

1810
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
What

1811
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
No that's

1812
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,616
No it's weird

1813
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
Impulse

1814
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,176
Is like

1815
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Alex

1816
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
Your brain is weird

1817
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,464
Barnes makes

1818
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
Was all about but you still

1819
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,816
To claim him

1820
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
You trying to pay

1821
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,376
The Legacy

1822
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,808
Appealing to our constitutional history

1823
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,624
Patriotic

1824
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:07,488
I'm because I'm a man I should have the same rights as all men is All-American

1825
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
It was not a reparations based

1826
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:28,480
I would like I would like Barnes now to give me one

1827
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
Martin Luther King

1828
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,296
King Junior that you have read and remember to

1829
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
None of that

1830
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:36,672
Go ahead

1831
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,232
Is a speech that Martin Luther King jr.

1832
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,328
68 it was on his speaking tour leading up to the Poor People's March

1833
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,096
Washington

1834
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:48,704
America refused to give the Negro any land

1835
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,312
An act of Congress are government was given

1836
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,128
It was willing to undergird its white peasant

1837
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
It's from Europe with an economic

1838
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,176
Floor

1839
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,200
But not only

1840
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
They built land-grant colleges

1841
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
Government money

1842
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,088
Teach them how to farm

1843
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,648
Not only that they provided County agents

1844
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
The further.

1845
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
What to use in farming

1846
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:14,048
Not only that they provided low interest rates in order that they could mechanize their Farm

1847
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,864
Not only that today many of these people

1848
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,936
Are receiving billions of dollars in federal subsidies

1849
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:24,800
Barb

1850
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,336
And this is what we are faced

1851
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,872
This is the reality

1852
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,176
He finished his thoughts by saying quote

1853
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:32,480
Washington in this campaign

1854
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,016
We are coming to get our check

1855
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:35,808
Illicitly

1856
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,600
About Refrigeration

1857
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
Barnes and Alex are not interested

1858
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,672
Martin Luther King

1859
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,488
Feeling him

1860
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
And turning him into a prop

1861
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,328
The further their agenda

1862
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
It's very transparent

1863
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
Really

1864
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,240
Fox News should be

1865
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,264
Band from

1866
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
Actually saying Martin

1867
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,640
Disgraceful

1868
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:01,920
Stay at

1869
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,992
Scott

1870
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah

1871
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,344
So remember how Alex responded to

1872
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,392
Step Brothers

1873
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:21,376
It would be just like a room talk.

1874
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,424
I I would find that

1875
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,448
F***** up

1876
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,520
It's even weirder that

1877
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,288
Not

1878
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Couple minutes later

1879
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,104
He says this

1880
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,688
About 14 years old

1881
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:39,808
One of my dad's cousins was already she was good-looking hot blonde by like 30 years old

1882
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:45,184
What

1883
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,000
Slapped

1884
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
What the f***

1885
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,480
I don't know you are

1886
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Man

1887
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:16,160
That's pretty

1888
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
I wish we'd never started I think you just thinks he has attorney-client privilege cuz he started

1889
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:35,104
So it's really weird to have a situation where yeah I mean there is the possibility that

1890
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
Some of

1891
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,456
Martin Luther King jr.

1892
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Personal history

1893
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,272
Is going to change

1894
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
The conversation

1895
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
I'm surrounded

1896
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,112
I think that's

1897
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
That's something

1898
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
That history allows for

1899
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:51,488
Scholarship allows for that

1900
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
Recording

1901
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,352
It's something that'll be more complicated conversations

1902
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,376
To have eventually

1903
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:03,776
Alex is like the mirror

1904
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,104
Furtive

1905
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
Number 14

1906
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,552
It's weird

1907
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,832
Really weird

1908
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,904
Kids four wheeler

1909
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Weird

1910
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,512
What it is

1911
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
Weird

1912
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,048
Cousin

1913
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
Weird

1914
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:32,192
He's married with first cousin once removed

1915
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,496
I don't appreciate

1916
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
Nope

1917
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
I thought

1918
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:43,456
I suppose I thought everybody knew that

1919
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,504
Jagger Hoover was trying to Black

1920
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
Martin Luther

1921
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Because he was

1922
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,672
End-of-summer VSCO pastor

1923
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:59,072
I think so I don't know cuz

1924
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,888
Not specific enough for me to really

1925
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,936
Clean a ton of information about it

1926
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
I don't know

1927
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,752
Hey I'm not qualified to speak

1928
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:10,336
Is

1929
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,640
A kernel of it probably involves

1930
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,664
Sprite

1931
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,296
But I also assume that there's more information

1932
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,392
Is known

1933
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,208
Going back through with so many of those p

1934
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
People of like

1935
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
The heroes of the

1936
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
Women's right

1937
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
Right to vote movie

1938
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,608
Also being

1939
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,144
Virulently anti-gay

1940
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,704
And all of this stuff

1941
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
You look back at the

1942
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
People who you think are

1943
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
Pillars

1944
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
Progressive

1945
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,616
Thought you know

1946
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,152
Go back inside

1947
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
Oh you're actually

1948
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,712
Like

1949
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:53,344
Complicated

1950
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,792
Does bring up something that really does

1951
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,560
Scare me

1952
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,608
Because it is

1953
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,888
That

1954
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,912
Done event

1955
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,960
Emergency

1956
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,728
Technologies

1957
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,032
That we have that is

1958
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Completely

1959
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:17,920
Rewrite their history by creating doctor videos

1960
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,712
The new technologies that are emerging

1961
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,016
There is the possibility of

1962
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,576
I'm doing that I don't think that's what's going on here but

1963
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,880
The f****** scary thought

1964
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,696
And I assume the people who listen to Alex

1965
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
Community will be

1966
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:34,816
Be more likely to do that than anyone else

1967
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
Tried

1968
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,376
Really hard never to think about that

1969
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
Yeah

1970
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
The annihilation

1971
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,288
Real

1972
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,640
So I don't know man this is weird episode

1973
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
Vexing as you said and I agree

1974
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,248
It's

1975
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,576
Crazy

1976
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,648
I expect he's 20 good work day

1977
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,952
Non

1978
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:06,048
Obviously I thought it was going to be a lot of Mueller talk

1979
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,888
Robert Barnes talks for a little while about how like

1980
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,008
Okay that's what I said

1981
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,800
Boring

1982
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,080
There's just not much

1983
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
Kind of its

1984
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
Every time

1985
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,784
Moon for murdering people

1986
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,344
There's also

1987
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
A lot of cauliflower

1988
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,440
Which I am not here for

1989
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
Don't care

1990
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,560
I'm glad

1991
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:42,144
Did we did this episode if only for Alex's

1992
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,936
Got to drop about dona

1993
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:48,288
Yeah that is so good it's only for that I do

1994
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,944
Or somebody bought donuts and I just inhaled two of them

1995
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,224
Stop

1996
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,272
Appreciate

1997
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:18,496
We'll be back with another episode

1998
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:32,320
I'm at go to bed book you can download

1999
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:36,160
Places scribe reviews go to Napster

2000
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:41,024
Brunch restaurant

2001
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:45,376
B. Can't remember any other download music

2002
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
But

2003
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:50,240
Then I mean Robert Barnes has had a lot of

2004
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
Weird client

2005
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,848
But

2006
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,640
Ralph Nader's killed anybody

2007
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,200
Probably true paid Robert Barnes

2008
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,736
Probably never killed anybody

2009
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Ralph Nader

2010
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
Maybe

2011
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,184
We probably have

2012
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,400
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
