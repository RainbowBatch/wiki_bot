1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
How's it going

5
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Out there

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
Damn

7
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
The situation

8
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
The other day

9
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Jordan

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
After the verdict came out on Thursday

11
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
We had the opportunity

12
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Do sit down and chat with

13
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
The plaintiffs attorney from the Texas cases

14
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
Mark about

15
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
The goings-on reflect a little bit on the case

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
What were the most likely next

17
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Steps

18
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832
Oh man that is a little boy

19
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Both holness

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
But Wellness

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
That's what it is

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,744
It's a bonus little episode for this weekend for you all to enjoy

23
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Sneaky Snake

24
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
But here's the thing do me and Jordan had me

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Me up

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
Pronouncing things weird all over

27
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
Me and Jordan had meant

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
To record an intro

29
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Like this

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
What I'm doing here but we forgot

31
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Anyway

32
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
I just thought it would be weird if he episode

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
Started and then just immediately jumped into an interview

34
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Maybe I'm wrong I don't know maybe this is unnecessary

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
Anyway before I get to up in my head I'll just throw it

36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Do the interview enjoy

37
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
And we will be talking to you soon

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Well folks

39
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
I figure

40
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
There's a lot of news there's a billion stories to cover

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
Close to a billion story and whenever we need some legal analysis on cases involve

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
One Alex Emerick Jones

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,272
There's a there's one

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
And symbol

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,464
Go to the rooftop of my apartment here in Chicago and I

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,584
I put a gummy worm Shadow on a cloud and then Bill calls mark

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,728
I like by the bark signal is a is a silhouette with the words underneath it

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Who sent me these tests

49
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
I think that's

50
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
It's a Matlock shaped symbols

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Or bones being that we have extended

52
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Sears

53
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Boys are y'all doing welcome back I raise my glasses Jordan brought champagne over this evening

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
And so welcome thanks for joining us

55
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
Absolutely absolutely couldn't be in better spirits today

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
I think a lot of the audience is the where

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Obviously that

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
The kinetic

59
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Came in on when

60
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
Wednesday

61
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
As a as a flood

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Work it will require 40 days and 40 nights to weather the storm is the level of flood we're dealing

63
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
And I think some people probably have some questions about you know Dynamics about a weird Circle

64
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
Cannoli

65
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
There's still so much

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
Get answered here

67
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
It's really a nice time to celebrate

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Thing I wanted to ask you first

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Start with that

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
You were in the courtroom for a while

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Correct

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
What was what was it like

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Sitting in the courtroom as a spectator is opposed to a gladiator you know.

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Into that courtroom right

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
And nobody knows what happened

76
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Echo when I walk in

77
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
You're like a Ray Lewis

78
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Open 2004 like

79
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
MMA

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
I had

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
Over the years gotten the chance to reach out and talk to you some of the other

82
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Plaintiff simulacra

83
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
But this was the first time that

84
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Like in Aruba

85
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
And got to meet them and

86
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
You know it's it's

87
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
Weird because sometimes people that you don't think about it too much

88
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
That is very technical sense

89
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
These cases are bars in Connecticut in in Texas

90
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Are are in competition

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Like that that would normally be the case

92
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Food that has

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Since almost

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
The outside

95
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Not good how we treat

96
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Yeah

97
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
These parents were so gracious to me and so they were expressing their admiration and dinner thanks for what we did

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
And I don't even represent

99
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
But we've kind of looking at it that way because

100
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
I think we are

101
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
As Cooperative as to Plaintiff lawyers across the

102
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
And we have

103
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
I'll teach other along this way

104
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
To make sure that these

105
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
People are not

106
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
On fast ones in either direction

107
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
And so

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
TriHealth whatever way I could

109
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
And it was it was a great experience

110
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Be there

111
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
NCB

112
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
I don't know there was something about that

113
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
You have that amount of gravity

114
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
It was quite an

115
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
But you know why

116
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,207
Midway through the trial and I had to leave and come home cuz I actually have

117
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Come home for a couple days then go try another case.

118
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Kansas City

119
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Nobody really knew what was going to

120
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
And nobody really

121
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
Will be there was even just this simple dangling thread of like is Alex

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
It's going to come back

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Totally

124
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Look I'll be honest

125
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Once I was

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
I kind of knew where we were going to stop

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Degree

128
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
Getting a value these cases

129
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
And so I was almost concerned after my case

130
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
If people were going to look at it and go

131
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
All right well yeah but that's a

132
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Just a total

133
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
You got one story of

134
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
What happened to it with meals

135
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Can you get one result that's just

136
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
And what's so rewarding about this text trial

137
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
That's not a fluke

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Is a fluke about it

139
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Yeah

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
You can almost look at it

141
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,015
Set the volume sets understands how the case is going to go

142
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
And then

143
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Christina's team

144
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
And

145
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
There's there was a lot of things that were going

146
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Right to start this truck

147
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Through a lot of really good thing

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
1231

149
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
So that's a good start

150
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Trial

151
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,287
Having already won

152
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
Defendants who got defaulted or came in there

153
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Damage hearing

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
And it still

155
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Red stripe

156
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Yeah yeah exactly

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Intensity of getting a dollar you know well like when Trump sued the NFL and they gave him a collar you know

158
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
Nearby do that was

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
Going to be what was happening because

160
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
I mean

161
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Is a jury once

162
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Information

163
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
It is

164
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
They're going to f***

165
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
That's just how it's going to be

166
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
And then the question is

167
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
These things going well for them

168
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
The first trial of Jones again

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Clearly broken

170
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Ready

171
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
That trial with the

172
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Defense lawyer who's going to put on a fairly standard defense

173
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
You wouldn't even pretended that he had remorse

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Big stride

175
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Play The Strip

176
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
And they got bigger Rick

177
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Just Brakes

178
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
The next draw any acts like a goddamn Madness

179
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Basically like

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
You got it like that on some level that you didn't work let's try

181
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
I didn't miners the wrong word I really didn't get an apology from all of the people who had

182
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,583
Had no idea this was going to be coming but what are you going to do you know

183
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Absolute Madness

184
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
You got normatec

185
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Wow did I

186
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
I never would have thought that I would see the lawyer

187
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Norma's literally asleep at one point in the trial

188
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
You like tweeting during the trial about other stuff

189
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Being openly

190
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
It was

191
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
I love him know what's going on

192
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
I tell you what I saw that closing statement of his yeah

193
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
What is

194
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Like what is

195
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
I know I know this is not going to be a popular statement but maybe

196
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
He's grieving families are liars

197
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
A really good question

198
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Loitering you can do

199
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
That lawyers prayer

200
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
Sounded fake as s*** to me they like no lawyers ever done that

201
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Nobody

202
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Nobody's ever said that why did he say it was like the old-fashioned lawyers Brer creative guys

203
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Prices on material there's nothing nothing to s*** on their Jordans

204
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,455
Well I will share with you the old Comics prayer

205
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
That's our favorite one to say before every

206
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Dear Lord made the last be plentiful

207
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
The alcohol intake

208
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Works in a criminal trial when you have a lawyer

209
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Who is

210
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Deeply and fundamentally unlock

211
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
Likable like Norman

212
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
But here's the thing that I don't think

213
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
People are putting enough

214
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Attentional

215
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Is that

216
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Well Christmas

217
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Really strong case in really favorable

218
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Condition

219
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Something that is so insanely.

220
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Difficult

221
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
When you just

222
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Right you get the number up

223
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Get up there 250

224
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Understands that

225
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Once you start having cysts

226
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
You have to

227
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
To get the numbers up so high that you're jury's gonna get sticker shock

228
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Write a natural worried well below.

229
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
To be able to defer

230
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
To be able

231
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Onboard

232
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Whiskey ideas

233
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
I'm giving this kind of award

234
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
Is literally the hardest thing a plaintiff lawyer can ever

235
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
I can leave it

236
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
I think

237
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
I think in terms of that that's

238
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,071
That's the number of plaintiff's like as opposed to with your case

239
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
With kneeling Scarlett it it's

240
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
You know it's one story

241
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
It may be a complicated story to tell but

242
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Somebody plaintiff's being able to

243
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
You no respect

244
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,919
Fully and accurately convey all of their different experiences

245
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,503
Say something that I thought was also well handled

246
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
It seems like a gigantic

247
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
You know you're going to if you do it right like you did

248
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
You get critical mass up

249
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
There was a huge danger they're losing the jury in the details all of them

250
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Different people

251
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
And having them get exhausted to the process

252
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,359
He was able to create new angles in new ways

253
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Tell the story yes it wasn't

254
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Newberry right off to head a great

255
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
Friendliness with the way that he questioned

256
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
The plaintiffs as well there was a

257
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Time certainly got

258
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Objections from Norm

259
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
But there was kind of a friendliness

260
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
I am

261
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
There contrast

262
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Text to mehdi kind of having more of a like

263
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Straightforward

264
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Report Costco for more like

265
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,503
Okay you can ask that question I know we all just want them to tell the story and you're trying to ask

266
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Just tell your story

267
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Like that

268
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Yes you're the person

269
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
Such a big fan of hers

270
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Is Eleanor Sterling's work

271
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Arguing legal propositions in that courtroom

272
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Was

273
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Rarely seen a lawyer

274
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Who is Stella

275
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Judgment

276
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
And there were so many big rules

277
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
And she did such an amazing

278
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
You never know like that

279
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,423
I bet she I bet she has to feel amazing just because there are so few times I think we're

280
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Are you can really get into like

281
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
The nitty-gritty of this isn't Pointe 14

282
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Steve

283
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
And feel like the righteous Crusader of

284
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
F****** you do like Sono

285
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Motherfuker you're like you don't get to do that

286
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Their legal team had

287
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
3 very

288
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Distinctive indifferent

289
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Personality

290
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Right.

291
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
4 bus route

292
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
Bearded weirdo

293
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Different shades

294
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Same color

295
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Look at you like f****** Wyatt Earp from Tombstone shut the fuk up

296
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
Episode

297
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
And it's

298
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Arts of Chris

00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,071
Is able to bring a level of moral righteousness to the courtroom

301
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Gardening bus

302
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Genuine person

303
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Would be over the top

304
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Broke

305
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Chris Stolle

306
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Genuine

307
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
That he was able to keep this like

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Very strong sense of moral Authority

309
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
That they needed to have an emotional angle to a needed to have a humanistic

310
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Relating

311
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Injustice

312
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Elemental

313
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Yeezy

314
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Symptoms of camaraderie

315
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Then you can pull that off

316
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
And then you have I don't know who's basically a strategy

317
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
At least use a a battlefield General

318
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
And to know how to use the rules

319
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Proponent where she wants

320
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Spirit animal

321
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Together

322
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Just knock knock

323
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
I just

324
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Directions super excited to work

325
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
No because

326
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Is there some

327
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
David

328
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Great workouts

329
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Flotsam.

330
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
And they did it and then so

331
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
They're out

332
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,535
Celebrating the world right now get the accolades and they deserve every bit of it

333
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Wild

334
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Totally

335
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
I guess that leaves us in a position where you know we have this almost 1 billion dollar

336
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Against alexson Infowars

337
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
He has put his company into bankruptcy

338
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Pepsi or Lee Street systems isn't bankrupt

339
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Anderson

340
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Sort of chaos going on with that is

341
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Is well with the lawyers

342
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
Turning on each other a little bit

343
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
But where

344
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Do where do

345
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Obviously

346
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
It's almost entirely unpredictable

347
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
But where do you get it

348
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Talking about when we talk about it

349
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Appeals what are the options

350
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
There was a

351
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
It was a slip

352
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Amount of me talking in the courthouse right after all

353
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
And I made some predictions

354
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
The bone picking

355
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Yeah.

356
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Follows me like a ghost

357
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
Is there was a thought that book

358
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Monster

359
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Big like they are

360
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
That this would end up with

361
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,279
Resolution through bankruptcy court cuz Jones once this over he's not going to chase

362
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
On this kind of stuff

363
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
It wouldn't make sense

364
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
He's going to have four trials

365
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
Oil overturns just ridiculous so and I figured that

366
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
He would do it

367
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
We wouldn't be looking at that

368
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
In other words we would be looking at

369
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
But now when you've got a billion-dollar gesture

370
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
You've got the

371
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
Screw it in like he said the other day on the show

372
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Yeah

373
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
You think I care about that

374
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
I think you're vastly overestimated how difficult

375
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
Big deal

376
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
What cause knee problems on

377
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Exactly enough to do a lot of work to do that

378
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
An infamy

379
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
You was great

380
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
The here's the real kicker of it right here's the

381
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
The real kicker

382
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Let's say

383
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,767
Reverses and orders a new trial to go forward

384
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,655
Do you have anything that would make me happier than

385
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
Very few things last time there was a billion dollars on Connecticut

386
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,943
How about you guys been with a 750 million and appealed it surprise

387
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Yeah

388
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,879
It wouldn't just be like this judgment is gone it would be ordering a new trial

389
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Alex's Behavior

390
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
You.

391
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Probably assumed wouldn't be any different

392
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Probably end up getting himself a Fulton again

393
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Like we reverse the clock back

394
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
June 2022

395
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
New trial date and try again

396
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
Lycon do the

397
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
Default could that be

398
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Nicole thing that I guess she

399
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Feasible

400
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
The judges make

401
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
To be essentially is just

402
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
What about the damage

403
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Just about to end and fundamental errors

404
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Bayou City

405
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Anything happens there

406
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
It's interesting

407
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,639
Objections to this would be off of like jury instruction

408
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
And strangely enough

409
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Raynaud's

410
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,631
Ironic about the idea of an appeal is that after all these four trials are

411
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Basically

412
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,263
We're going to find out that once you have the ability to choose that Jerry

413
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
A like

414
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
You can weed out certain people

415
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
Any reasonable person

416
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Will agree

417
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Alex

418
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,063
Saudi idea of that you can take it

419
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
2 quart

420
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Bill

421
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
Kinder infuriates me whenever it's like

422
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
It doesn't matter where you are or who you choose as long as you're getting rid of info Warriors this motherfukers go

423
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,447
I need a jury of my peers and my peers are crazy

424
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
So

425
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
I noticed

426
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
But we had some really strong well-informed errors on the jury who I think

427
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
In the next round

428
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
Early next year or something like that

429
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
Equals all going to know

430
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
About this billion-dollar

431
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Not the right

432
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Exactly

433
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
Peninsula Libras people who do know about it I probably going to get you

434
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
InTouch

435
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
What's been going on

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
In what I've learned through this process is

437
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
That is

438
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Perhaps mourad

439
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,007
Advantageous

440
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
Are you yeah it became so clear to me when we had the guys from the dollop on

441
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
And like I was playing stuff that Jordyn Woods

442
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Just be like oh

443
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
Yeah okay I don't like taking care of her freaking out

444
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Play kind of

445
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
Junior varsity Alex content to me

446
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
How is this one show

447
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,399
It is kind of a situation where

448
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
This has you know we were all worried

449
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,823
As you said earlier Dan and I were both worried about the judgment and all of this stuff

450
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,663
And I think that really might be because we are so close to it

451
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
But if we had could step back

452
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
You know like

453
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
If you can go back and listen to episode 1

454
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
F*****-up about this s*** you know like

455
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
And I saw none of it and Alex said it's time to pray all three lost our mind

456
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
That is nothing

457
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,632
You know what

458
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah

459
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Factor that in nearly as much

460
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Opposite of naivety

461
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,128
You're something else. It's still kind of naive that's correct

462
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
You know yeah

463
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
What will

464
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
Going

465
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
There will need to be

466
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
So on the 20th

467
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Next week

468
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
Robin hearing and hustling for enter the Judgment there

469
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
We're going to try to make a plate

470
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Damage there

471
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
I know for

472
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Facts going to be

473
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Much easier playing possum

474
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
It's just that sets up and

475
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
But much easier

476
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
As well

477
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Get that inter Thursday

478
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
Sanctions

479
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Or

480
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Andino's

481
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Northern Tool judge request

482
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
So we done that

483
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136
Nick about Norm sanction

484
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
I wish never we are

485
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,280
We're doing also stations motion for the improper removal in bankruptcy back in April

486
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
But that caused us

487
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
So we're going to see call that and brexit going

488
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Instead of going after Jones and the company

489
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
We're going after the lawyers you did these things

490
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Oldies things off

491
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
Are we are we talking about a media star here

492
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,296
We have some news on him coming up getting all just don't know if I spend

493
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
Keep your eyes peeled the story of Robert Barnes

494
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
For what he did during trial

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,120
It was another one of their lawyers to demerit album who was involved with the represent a

496
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Earlier

497
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,728
And made certain representations but Infowars LLC private bankruptcy

498
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Will be happening

499
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
We having a similar thing happened

500
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
I know

501
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
Be bigger right

502
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
I think when you have a billion-dollar

503
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Billionaire

504
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
I don't think you

505
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
I don't know compensatory is a billion dollars I feel like they are going to wind up going ham on

506
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
Damages tickets very possible

507
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
Also like the unfair Trade Practices part wasn't even right

508
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Magnet sort of hanging in the back

509
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
It isn't it was a really nice

510
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
They told other hat on that one and if they can

511
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Sale at through

512
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Wow what a great move

513
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,344
Right I mean it's I don't think anybody's ever thought about doing it

514
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
The first one

515
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
And it was I mean

516
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
I don't know for certain

517
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
But

518
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Spell Eleanor

519
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
On all of that

520
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Strategy right there

521
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
And

522
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
If they

523
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
You can't ever result

524
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
This will be a millstone around the neck forever

525
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Westchase

526
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Right. Maybe where we're going

527
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
So they're going to do the same thing that got to get there

528
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
Linda Lavin hearing for entry of judgment

529
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,952
Once that happens before there's about 30 days to file notice of appeal within the various state courts

530
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
And if they want to do that

531
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Did Logan the PO by Prince August 8th

532
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
To the Texas Court of Appeals

533
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,680
And then that Court will rule on everything

534
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,776
That would probably take a 9-month something like that

535
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,640
And then there will be no probably a fuel after that we'll do it what they call away

536
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Petition for review

537
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
Text Supreme Court

538
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
That's not a mandatory

539
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,552
Decide whether they want to hear it

540
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
We're not in the past

541
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
Define to hear the earlier if you're so I don't

542
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
I don't know

543
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
But that would probably

544
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
And then in the petition to the US

545
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Weekly liked over Jack.

546
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,752
But we are probably looking at a year-and-a-half to Verso

547
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Before

548
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Brass tacks

549
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
You're saying

550
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,480
You're saying we're looking at two years before people legit go to his house and start

551
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Digging up

552
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,344
F****** gold yeah yeah yeah

553
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
Write the problem there is that okay

554
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Because at the same time

555
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Fraudulent transfer suit

556
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Canyon against

557
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Then we get to go after the money that isn't

558
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Technically in Alex Jones

559
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
But that has been transferred over into other entities are been given Dollar Insider

560
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Exact

561
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,832
Woodchips everybody's radar on this issue PR

562
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Play setup

563
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
And there's a truck out there

564
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
EJ truck

565
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,352
Just got 30 right now so

566
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,240
Anything else

567
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Eddie Money

568
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
I don't know

569
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
It's never what this

570
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
It's not it's worth

571
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
That's not why they're

572
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
The idea of the next

573
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Fine whatever

574
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
But isn't that isn't that ultimately the question that so many people are having right now and it's the one that I'm hearing

575
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
From a lot of people in regards to our show

576
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Specifically obviously is like

577
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,288
Is Alex going to be on the air for another two years until people start digging up

578
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
Is Goldie you know what I mean like a problem with this

579
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
With this whole situation one I want to say that

580
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
The law is great and it makes perfect sense

581
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
To who

582
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
It is it is a thing where it's like

583
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:09,184
This judgment is so immediate after so much

584
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Bulshit

585
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
You know and then

586
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,096
People are going to want this to then be an immediate result

587
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Right right

588
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Exactly they want people to be like Alex has to get in a plane tonight and had to vent

589
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,104
Venezuela to survive a Flight Risk

590
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Reno

591
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Look

592
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,760
Immediate consequences are immediate effects

593
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
But I think our

594
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
Even if you

595
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
You could take all of us

596
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
And you could

597
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Essentially shut down Imports

598
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
That's not going to stop him from being a meal like

599
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
You'll be on the internet

600
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
Videos of do whatever

601
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
You're not going to get rid of that wavy the way you really

602
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Have to do is to be able to

603
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Marginalizing neuter

604
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
His influence on American

605
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
And that that really is

606
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Realized

607
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Madness starts

608
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
The suit itself

609
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
You got to remember it's tickets bobbin in a

610
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Lafferty Sioux Falls

611
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Couple months later

612
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Jones basically mind

613
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Stop threatening to kill Robert Mueller

614
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Start posting

615
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
To get the

616
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Jack Johnson

617
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Races

618
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,056
Transphobic stuff during that summer

619
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
The combination of

620
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
Vegetable soup

621
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Cosby

622
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Jack Johnson

623
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Which I still think was

624
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
Done in the most ridiculous

625
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
An arbitrary way.

626
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Mistakes all through it but like it got.

627
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
First biggest

628
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
The soup

629
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
I really do think

630
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Loufest 2019

631
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
A 2018

632
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Basically

633
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
And he was

634
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Effectively

635
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Find the suit itself

636
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
In the deplatforming reduces Decor size of his audience

637
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
And then no

638
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Default

639
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
All of it

640
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,200
After this constant drumbeat of how he's not taking it seriously and then the verdicts

641
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
He's been heavily marginalized

642
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
And in a way that

643
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
I'm not even sure the collecting the money makes

644
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
That much more of a

645
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
I think it'll reduce the size

646
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Operation

647
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Probably be the same

648
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
I think you have

649
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
Number of impact

650
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
I think that the people who are already in and deeply end with Infowars it's not going to marginalize him with

651
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
But you never be able to

652
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
To do that.

653
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,200
They're beat there's a vaster awareness of

654
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Who he is among

655
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Normies perhaps

656
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
And that in a wave it's like

657
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
Lost a billion dollars over Sandy Hook

658
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
I think that could be helpful in some ways

659
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,232
Yeah things of like

660
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Credit

661
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Impact

662
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
The Blues in the case like these

663
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
But that's something that will will be a problem for him

664
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,008
And in order to maintain whatever

665
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Relevancy has

666
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
And abilities

667
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
To get audience

668
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
He has to have his own site like

669
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Banned. Video

670
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
It is intensely

671
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Expensive for him

672
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
Bandwidth cost

673
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,320
And the only way to keep getting

674
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
People

675
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
To go to the site

676
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Is the offer

677
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
A platform for weirdos like David Icke

678
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
And

679
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,864
Some of these other folks like that guy who dresses up like Uncle Sam and yells at people on the street

680
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,424
Like he has that stuff

681
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
That's costing him an arm and a leg

682
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
And eventually he's not going

683
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Going to be able to

684
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Afford

685
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
To run this site

686
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
And other people are going

687
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
To Pony up the

688
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
The money for that

689
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
And

690
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
You know your left in a position where

691
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
Is that goes away

692
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
He has Infowars

693
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
I mean I think

694
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,768
I think what we are all under estimating the streaming site

695
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,864
I didn't know we're all estimating as far as you know when you say like

696
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,728
He won't lose his Reacher or he can still do a show on YouTube or whatever

697
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
I don't know on YouTube

698
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
You know he can do a show and put it

699
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
It's somewhere

700
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
I think we're under estimating the amount

701
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
Not today

702
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
That he gets from having a professor

703
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
National Studio

704
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,440
Yes like if he no longer has a professional studio and he's going out of his f****** room

705
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,024
And you look at his video and you see the same thing that you do

706
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,608
With ner ruled absolutely

707
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,728
I don't think he has the ability to go beyond that because he doesn't have any Talent

708
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
Yeah you know he doesn't he doesn't

709
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
Create anything

710
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,664
What was cool for him to be broadcasting out of like his spare bedroom when he was

711
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,248
Coming up yeah it's super cool to have those bonafide

712
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,624
To be like the falling action of like you had this CNM level

713
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Sat with elaborate like

714
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,720
Visuals behind you and

715
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
A skull on your desk

716
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Ask for some reason

717
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
And then your

718
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
You know back

719
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,144
Do recording in a in a bedroom

720
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Yeah

721
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:12,800
Not the same be surprising to like really look at whether or not

722
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
That moment when it becomes sad

723
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,200
To be a fan of Alex Jones really has a has a like an effect

724
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:23,808
You know he's fallen so far and you're still a fan of Alex Jones

725
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
Aren't you at some point maybe like this is not fun

726
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
That's my point hasn't already come

727
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
It's always been my son's I don't know.

728
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,704
It's always been my sense that among his viewership

729
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,288
The people who are actually buying the supplements is a very

730
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Very very small component

731
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
It is

732
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Or spending a s*** ton of money

733
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
Like any televangelist yeah

734
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,112
And I don't think anyone noticed that his Revenue has never been terribly.

735
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,416
Ended on his total spread like

736
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
Escapes from crazy world

737
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
I got doesn't

738
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
And so I think

739
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Look

740
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
The the important effects

741
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
I want to just I want to put a button in this really quick

742
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:23,200
It does seem like when like the FBI says no one died at Sandy Hook breached into

743
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
What you might call Mainstream like

744
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Get spread wider

745
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
That did have an effect on

746
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Spreading his sales

747
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Daddy

748
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
But when he's like on

749
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Piers Morgan

750
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,256
Or you goes on Rogan that doesn't necessarily Spike sale

751
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Snow exactly

752
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
And I do think the difference between

753
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
It is broke through

754
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Into a grater

755

Community

756
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Pretty pretty damn crazy

757
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,336
And then do I do think that like you look at the 2017

758
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
. right after Trump's victory

759
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
There were a lot of sorta

760
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
Standard NASCAR dad major conservatives who suddenly discovered Alex Jones during that period and make it was

761
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Dangerous thing

762
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
He doesn't have

763
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
More dangerous

764
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,768
2020 election goes

765
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,072
If the suit never happened Alex as old

766
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Platform

767
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,008
Turned on Trump by then though

768
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,896
We have a different election maybe we have more people of January 6th

769
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
That could be the bigger problem hundred percent

770
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
We could have a dictatorship

771
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,184
And I mean it was frustrating to me like going to the covid-19 like

772
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
You can't stop

773
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
You never real

774
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
Effectively stop him the only way you can completely

775
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
I hope this is done that

776
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
But I think

777
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
There's this bigger effect and I

778
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
I need this is real legit is that

779
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
There is now been a signal sent out

780
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
Media of all stripes

781
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
That if you start

782
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Bringing private

783
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
Blame

784
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Innocent

785
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
People into your conspiracy lies

786
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
And start telling false facts about the M intentional wrecks

787
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Big Damn price tags

788
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
The effect on

789
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Other

790
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,424
We're edging close to I might do some things like our shows

791
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
This is

792
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Considerable

793
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Message

794
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Is that like your kid

795
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
Conspiracy games are all fun and

796
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
Litany of things that Alex's

797
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
I'm full of s*** about that he's never been sued about it never will be suitable

798
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
It's all fun and games

799
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
But there is a point at which

800
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
You need to be careful

801
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
Don't do these things

802
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
I bet

803
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,376
Maybe that's a lucky message for some of those people, you know a reasonable Society

804
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Could

805
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
Take all of the things that Alex Jones

806
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Did

807
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,568
In regards to this case in regards to these people

808
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
And be like okay

809
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,712
Well we know yelling fire in a crowded theater is not free speech

810
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
So if you do

811
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,808
Exactly this list of

812
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Things

813
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Then you go to jail

814
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
Roar your show is gone or something like that

815
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Because it is like any reasonable jury would come to the conclusion that you owe a billion dollars if you do that

816
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
So why not skip the five years of

817
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,960
Goddamn litigation and just go you did.

818
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Exact list of things that every reasonable person thinks cost a billion dollars to so guess what you started

819
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
Take a breath

820
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
A normal media descendants

821
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
These cases early any

822
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,560
This is how it was always going to end and and they saw the Sturtevant

823
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
That wasn't the case

824
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,544
All people right after I called you I wish you the best a boy that's can be a hard uphill climb

825
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
You know I don't get you

826
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
And it took a long

827
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Process

828
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Strategically

829
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,600
You did a very good job that is a good point

830
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
People underestimate how hard the guys

831
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
All around all around

832
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,816
So he dug his own grave and I'm like

833
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
People look I got a shovel

834
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
It was a big shop

835
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
Alex did play a part in taking that

836
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
Backgrounds

837
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,600
You said before even I believe I'm on the show that like there is a point or maybe was Bill

838
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
That like

839
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
This could have been resolved so easily

840
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
It in earlier times if

841
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
If Alex

842
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
He's done it with other cases before like

843
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
With Hamdi ulukaya you know the Chobani

844
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
He said he was going

845
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
Go to fight that or die

846
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
And then he settled

847
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,592
Like I'm sorry about it

848
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
It's so funny that you did that

849
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
It's Waltz me that it's just because of the Tudors

850
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
It's right because of where to Bonnie is

851
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Comet Ping Pong is

852
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Those are both of those venues

853
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
If you make an apology

854
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
Before the shoot and retract

855
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
Your damages

856
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
It wouldn't have

857
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Been worth it

858
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
The weirdest part about Alex

859
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
Does Comet Ping Pong apology was

860
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
Spike the 15 minutes he did about how good the p

861
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
Pizza was and he really didn't try the

862
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
That's how you apologize

863
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
I'm seen in the past day or two like

864
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
These

865
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,096
I guess right-wing influencers who are trying to test the waters about how much they can

866
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
NAIC

867
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
Charlie Kirk

868
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Who say the same Whitney b******* about life

869
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
This is a Alex apologize

870
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Show me

871
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Show me

872
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
Show me the clip show me where Jones said

873
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
I'm sorry for the things that I've done

874
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
Apologize for when he said it was fake last week

875
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Exactly right like that

876
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
Oh he only did it a couple of times

877
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Motherfukers

878
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
40 hours

879
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
In evidence in our trial

880
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
The window now from exhibit Tulare

881
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,936
100 more episodes

882
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,776
Between 2013 and 2018 that they never produce to us

883
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
She's a

884
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
He only did this occur

885
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
Couples

886
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Just new reality

887
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Try to defend the Alex Jones

888
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Bike

889
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Remind

890
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,392
Yeah like

891
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,816
Glenn Greenwald hasn't said a word I'll tell you what

892
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,632
That dude off for a while now.

893
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
F****** forever and I know man it's annoying you know what I think it is the case with those people who are defend

894
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Kim

895
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
Meet the baby a guy going down

896
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,736
But a guy who's going down can be profitable for them and Subway

897
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,136
Makes me think of Toys R Us going bankrupt a lot of people made a lot of money you know that kind of

898
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
The way that Alex makes a hero at a

899
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,632
Colonel Travis in the Alamo you know there is kind of electromagnet

900
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
What's the reality of Colonel tribe

901
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
They want this in there

902
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
And I think they're trying to engage in the myth

903
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
As Alex

904
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Is

905
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
You know

906
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Being surrounded by Santa Ana

907
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,200
Why don't we

908
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
Vinnie Johnson or Charlie Kirk or one of those

909
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
I don't actually

910
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Defensive Alex I think they're really in tune with

911
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Which water

912
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
The people that grifter

913
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
And so

914
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
There is a small contingent

915
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
They know they can get engaged

916
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
Probably feel like they would look weak

917
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
If they didn't

918
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Exactly

919
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,056
Well this is what happens when you speak out Against the Machine minimum

920
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
The f*** are you talkin about place

921
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
There are so many people

922
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,968
Who are like enemy of the above like

923
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
I guess like modern establishment liberals or whatever

924
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
And if there really was like

925
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Hillary

926
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
Maroon van to take them down

927
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
Know that that's not how that would work

928
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
Right

929
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,304
Marquess what you're not taking into account

930
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
You don't know that Robbie Parker was elected to be the shadow Secretary General of the UN

931
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Power it's

932
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Power this is people

933
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,015
Yeah that's what's so disgusted about it

934
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
Here's something that's so

935
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
Obviously Morley abs

936
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Feminist ohura

937
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
Even if you just take what like

938
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Think like a

939
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,815
Charlie Kirk what he probably wants to imagine Alex Jones

940
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Which would his

941
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
It's still pretty

942
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Never engage with

943
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Actually jet

944
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
Which is so morally horrific

945
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
And the fact

946
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,687
Something that morally obscene has taken

947
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
This much effort

948
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,271
To be able to address and hold accountability for

949
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
Slippery slope

950
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
Against these people

951
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Literally

952
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
The worst

953
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Defamation in America

954
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
History

955
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Yeah I know

956
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,327
Couldn't couldn't be stopped

957
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,471
The next time way better than a billion-dollar judgment if somebody just wrote a lot that was like okay

958
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,871
If you defame people multiple times and make a billion dollars off of it and then you get sued for it instead of trying to

959
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
You haven't

960
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,503
Default judgement and then if you don't like if you do hold fish it just it's over

961
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,623
Go away I think I better support the spirit of what you're discussing

962
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
I know I'm just saying that

963
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
Like writing that into a Logwood

964
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,047
Would be very complicated

965
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,935
The debate the floor debate on that would be intense like what if we just finally accepted a

966
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,751
Floor for defamation that's Criminal

967
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
You know just like this is

968
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
Here this is a crime I feel like

969
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:32,223
The problems that everyone is having as they want to talk about the billion-dollar judgment

970
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,783
And not like the reason that it's a billion dollars

971
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,343
He committed a real-life crime

972
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
I'll go you one better

973
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,047
And in what he did is under Texas Penal Code 2204

974
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Is that if you intentionally

975
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
Commit emotional

976
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Injury

977
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
To a

978
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Person

979
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
That is a felon

980
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Annie's parents

981
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
At the time that he committed these injuries were suffering from severe emotional disturbance

982
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
Hell yeah

983
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
That makes them disabled

984
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Where illegal

985
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
If

986
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
But the thing that we're going to be talking about on the 20th

987
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
This month

988
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,159
Cause that conduct was for me

989
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
In all of the album

990
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
That's going to get us around the punitive damage

991
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Oh that's great

992
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
No.

993
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
An Enzo here

994
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,007
Yeah it is definitely going to be our argument in court on the 20th

995
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,335
Very well could have been

996
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
So that's like

997
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,247
Even our criminal law recognizes the moral

998
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
And how hard it is to press

999
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,647
All the time

1000
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
Is it like Jones

1001
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Hundred percent light on the stand

1002
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
I think that's probably

1003
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
True

1004
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
That he

1005
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
Why

1006
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
Write intentionally.

1007
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,519
Is a much tougher half of a cracked secretly with Joan

1008
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,383
Will the judge in your case even made that point that's like you might

1009
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
I think this is true

1010
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Right

1011
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:13,087
There are certain things but see there's a big difference between some of those things out for saying that he thought were true that that the record shows or not

1012
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
Brighten this so there for me to not eat

1013
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Said that way

1014
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Well isn't that

1015
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Ansari

1016
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
When you said I mean look let's go back to

1017
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
Perry Mason

1018
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,655
Right when he said I searched my phone I pulled it down I put in Sandy Hook

1019
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
And then boom is found out that that's not true

1020
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,055
It's very difficult to arrive at a conclusion that that wasn't an intentional attempt

1021
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
And I think

1022
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
I hope

1023
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
Anyway to Travis County prosecutor

1024
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Looking at that foot

1025
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Sting is perjury in

1026
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Imuran

1027
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
You never see

1028
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
I just never thought

1029
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
Okay what if

1030
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
What if we held a trial

1031
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
All right now

1032
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
And now

1033
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Before you say no

1034
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,071
There a lot of alleys in Chicago so we hold a trial

1035
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
And me and Dad will Danza judge

1036
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Obviously

1037
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,215
Right and I'm going to be the defendant for Alex Jones

1038
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
Edgar the defense lawyer for Alex Jones

1039
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,383
Be great and then we repeat the s*** out of him I feel like this

1040
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Perfect sense as a

1041
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Court system

1042
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:17,087
Is this bad

1043
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
Obviously bankruptcy

1044
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Wait what they're going to fund

1045
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Chicago alley

1046
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:36,287
Yeah I don't know it's a courtroom he would be legally assault

1047
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
Something really

1048
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
There is this

1049
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
Through-line among so many people of their abs

1050
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
Disgust for Jones

1051
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Horrible

1052
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:52,415
You put them in a room without showing the loan Alex Jones not walking out of that room

1053
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
Something to me

1054
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
Very

1055
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
I need another Italian

1056
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Republic

1057
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
The idea that we took

1058
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
This case

1059
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
And pursued it like

1060
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Total white hat

1061
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
And get it every by the book

1062
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,127
4/4 years and did it correctly and brought him Financial ruin

1063
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
And ended

1064
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,991
That to me is so much better than somebody who doesn't like Alex Jones Bieber

1065
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Yeah

1066
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,879
I think people would think that of someone like me or Jordan

1067
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
Well maybe not Jordan but like

1068
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
Was there in the deposition and

1069
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
I left

1070
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Without beating him up

1071
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,839
I just needed a margarita

1072
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
That was that was

1073
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
Two patients and yeah

1074
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
The process that you guys follow

1075
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Ultimately I think that

1076
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
Sentiment really come

1077
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Thumbs down to like

1078
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Everyone wishes

1079
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,575
That they could pursue it and and

1080
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
Beat him in the way that you did

1081
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
In the way that the lawyers have done in the way that the

1082
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
The families of done

1083
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
To go out there

1084
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Text to Stacy

1085
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,839
All of this s*** and then to win

1086
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
That's really cool

1087
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
But it took a long f******

1088
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
Can time and what if we

1089
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
People think you know

1090
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,103
Like that's just how your brain works is like it's been a long time

1091
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
Are you coming on the way while back you don't like that's kind of the Felix well-respected

1092
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Way more is the way that you do

1093
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
Waiting sympathize

1094
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,415
With your feelings of outrage and frustration all of that

1095
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
Australian it for all these years

1096
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Frustration ourselves

1097
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
Let me see if I can strike a balance

1098
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
Alex has a lot of money

1099
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
Yeah

1100
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:43,519
There was a period of time where he was offering to do a celebrity boxing match with Tom Barn

1101
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Maybe

1102
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
We get Jordan

1103
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
Any celebrity boxing match with Alex

1104
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:55,551
Did the Chicago back alley in the middle solutely no cameras let's just kill myself

1105
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
If you can get

1106
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,351
Ultimate default

1107
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
We knew we knew that was sort of

1108
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
I mean stop

1109
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,727
There are

1110
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,823
Right and we took we just put me on

1111
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
One family story

1112
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
And

1113
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
It was really nice because you get all these things that Not only was it

1114
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
ReSound referendum on him

1115
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
Embarrassed

1116
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
I mean not

1117
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Walking stick

1118
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Panicking

1119
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
It was off

1120
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,023
Larynx come on man

1121
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,119
Completely disappeared the moment he knew he was in real

1122
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
Anxiety

1123
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Were you there

1124
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,663
Good to have all of that go down to have these Nashville moments of embarrassment

1125
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
Embarrasses attorney was really

1126
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
He did make salt

1127
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Late night shows

1128
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,367
Feeling from it

1129
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
But you know that it's just

1130
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
You're just opening the door on the stove

1131
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
Define

1132
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
I just don't like so much

1133
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Equal

1134
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
That sets

1135
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
Literally a record-setting verdict

1136
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Great Lake

1137
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Is that

1138
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
Vinnie Paz

1139
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
Their damages drug damage

1140
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Anybody involved

1141
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,975
Yeah

1142
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
That that is really is

1143
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
That last one is looking at there is

1144
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Really really threatened

1145
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Even even with Marcel

1146
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,447
Didn't have like

1147
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,471
Earphone effect

1148
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
Is still really recover

1149
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
Very possibly facing

1150
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,663
Yeah

1151
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
The factors

1152
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
What's after mine

1153
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,111
And it over the course of these four years

1154
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Even with the

1155
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Procedure

1156
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
McKay's

1157
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
We basically stayed neck-and-neck

1158
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,095
Come down to even after all the pills aren't trials or like a month apart

1159
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Stop this one

1160
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,959
You punch like the story being told it's amazing

1161
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
Better

1162
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
It really is

1163
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,079
You're not going to bring you back to another point I think it's super important

1164
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
That people need to realize and that needs to get said more

1165
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Bike

1166
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:34,527
People like Alex Jones going to put on a First Amendment defense but

1167
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
But he chose not to participate in there for.

1168
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
Defaulted so haha I didn't get to do that

1169
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Is that

1170
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
In the beginning of the case

1171
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:48,095
She was allowed to bring an anti-slapp motion

1172
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
What was that for

1173
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,263
He had appeals up to the Texas court of appeals and UPS the Texas Supreme Court

1174
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,591
Google read that like one of them is really spelled all out really nice

1175
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
Wagner versus Jones opinion from

1176
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,295
All of the first things that you had every chance to do that do that

1177
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
It wasn't until he came back from that

1178
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
And still over years for just didn't participate

1179
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
That.

1180
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,071
So he got to try to vindicate his first amendment rights in its tail

1181
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
This has nothing to do with

1182
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
False facts about

1183
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Identifiable people

1184
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
The first apartment stuff actually failed

1185
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
And that beat

1186
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Because that

1187
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,663
Pageantry wasn't available to him

1188
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,455
He decided not to engage

1189
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
Knowing he would lose

1190
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
And that's the Dafoe

1191
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:44,159
I think more less I really believe looking back on it there was this hubris

1192
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
What's the worst

1193
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Squaw Creek

1194
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
And and they thought

1195
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,143
Advantage of

1196
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
But you didn't

1197
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Do that

1198
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,175
And the fact these first amendment issues were tested and I had to breach my ass off

1199
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
That's what got us

1200
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
The place that we are

1201
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
He was denied

1202
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Fundamental constitutional rights

1203
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Anything like that

1204
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
Well I have an expert

1205
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Named

1206
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
Viva Frei

1207
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
Why who tells me

1208
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
He's an associate of a very famous mediastar

1209
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,703
You tells me that that's

1210
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,031
Collect the First Amendment rights were violated

1211
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
You know Daddy's that is one of the questions that I have I have been fascinated by throughout those trial

1212
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Is

1213
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
You know the

1214
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Great

1215
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,927
Create links that have gone to avoid letting him turn it into a political thing or letting him

1216
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Really

1217
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Spew his b*******

1218
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
Unencumbered

1219
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
You know

1220
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Like

1221
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,631
All things considered the question I have really for like

1222
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Humanity

1223
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
Is if Alex was allowed to do that

1224
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:08,895
Acat grabbing one juror you know like is that what humans have is it you have to with

1225
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Cold

1226
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,991
Some b******* in order to have a reasonable response

1227
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,319
Or is it just going to overtake at least one person

1228
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
You know

1229
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,439
I think was his and Norms concept of the whole thing is

1230
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
We need to get one person

1231
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:30,143
Pills

1232
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,959
Play talk about the Connecticut Supreme Court like they were like

1233
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,775
We were just one judge away from

1234
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:42,175
You don't think if we could have gotten that one other person overall flip this

1235
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
So close to right

1236
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,295
We're not right but goddamn if we lied better we beat

1237
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Closer

1238
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,111
Everything out in that one juror

1239
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:54,975
Then this all would like that with the amount of time that Norm spent like

1240
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
Here's the question that I have for you is

1241
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,863
Norm and Edna

1242
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
Spent so much time trying to like

1243
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
Worm around

1244
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
You know all of those restrictions

1245
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Directions for that

1246
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,615
How many times would you have said objection

1247
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,943
When it wasn't said I'm not telling you to compare your

1248
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Performance overall

1249
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,575
When you were watching it were you screaming objection

1250
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,695
And then I gave up

1251
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
What is he up to

1252
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Enormous

1253
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Weasel

1254
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,591
A wild-card I won't use any Jordans

1255
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,687
A word amazing

1256
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
No sir

1257
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,319
We when he came down to try to apply to

1258
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
Try our case

1259
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
R&R position

1260
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,439
Threat

1261
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Potential

1262
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,095
The courtroom

1263
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
That's going to stab at his

1264
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
Ponytail

1265
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
But but we

1266
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
And so we did get them

1267
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Well card whatever and then he would have known

1268
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
Hydrocodone

1269
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,599
Boy do you have to

1270
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
I'll have to be second-guessing.

1271
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
No question about it

1272
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
Holy cow

1273
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
Really

1274
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
I mean what's that

1275
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
Orman's cheese at must have felt so good going into the office at that neck

1276
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,527
How about this I'm walking down

1277
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,319
How about that I kept it

1278
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Down

1279
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
Billion dollars

1280
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Pretty great lawyer aren't you

1281
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,303
Only accidentally sent a bunch of texts

1282
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,655
Cancel I didn't do that

1283
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,239
Is the Synergy off these cases

1284
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
I mean

1285
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,567
That was some some finesse

1286
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
Required

1287
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Puerto Rico

1288
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,039
Which am I only had four

1289
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
Let me look before I put those text messages in front of Jones

1290
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
I because I was

1291
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
Good look at these documents

1292
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
We're hours

1293
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,559
Be able to get that stuff

1294
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
Altogether so then

1295
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,143
Chris has a month with the sex message

1296
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
And he

1297
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Saturday

1298
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
Some of that stuff

1299
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
Roodle

1300
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,127
Until you have these synergies between the case they had the

1301
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
You'll notice

1302
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
That in my case in mine

1303
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Replay.

1304
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,551
And half the depositions that we played were from Lac

1305
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
It's interesting Chris Madden

1306
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,927
Made an appearance in my trial so did doted math

1307
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
Synergy

1308
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,583
You know I called him Chris and I was like

1309
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Manos neistat

1310
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:16,447
Have a 6-person drouthy down there you know because I had you in mind as well down there

1311
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
It was it's nice that that that

1312
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Ben 10

1313
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
Chase

1314
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
You just don't know how it would have turned out

1315
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
But when you have

1316
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,735
Or in a synergize and they're all on the same page

1317
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
You kind of know how they're all going to turn

1318
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Yeah

1319
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
It really was that way

1320
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,719
Yeah that's that's we were talking about when we first got started or talk about how often times

1321
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,535
James cases will be sorted in competition with each other

1322
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,607
Yeah I feel like who's going to take precedence

1323
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Thanks for the

1324
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,935
The judgments you know

1325
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,263
And the idea of taking credit like I'm not

1326
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,871
Seeing MattyB like hey I'm the greatest lawyer for getting a billion Denmark

1327
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:04,319
You guys were really kind of s*** you haven't been on SoundCloud

1328
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:10,463
Time release

1329
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
Disstrack on the architect

1330
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,559
DisplayPort

1331
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:24,543
He is really really kind of amazing because it was like you had

1332
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
To Independence

1333
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,895
Teams coming up with interesting ideas

1334
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:33,247
Communicating with each other and then going back and coming up with more in

1335
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,855
Interesting ideas really fascinating to watch the interplay between

1336
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
I think part of Veep

1337
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:44,255
That would be because the families while not one

1338
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,815
Mike indistinguishable Bob

1339
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Anything are all

1340
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,143
Dealing with the same thing

1341
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,703
Right

1342
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
Cannot be a bond that's

1343
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Unbroken

1344
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,335
Early in the case

1345
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:02,943
And you don't particularly early in the case and I didn't know each other like we do now

1346
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
NM Krishna

1347
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Very very

1348
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Evil

1349
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,551
Yeah

1350
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Really strong pain

1351
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
And

1352
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Early in the

1353
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Nothing Network

1354
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
Wired Trista say

1355
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Under his

1356
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
Protective order with the court

1357
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,815
The documents that

1358
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
The court actually asked for provision in the protective order

1359
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
To allow

1360
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
2md share those documents with me if you got stuff

1361
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
In an interview

1362
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,871
Cases where they weren't on the same page that wouldn't

1363
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
Right and it was

1364
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
It was it was always

1365
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Felt like

1366
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
This was a boat

1367
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
That we are sailing together

1368
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,367
Depending on which case something is happening then

1369
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,903
Somebody's going to be at the wheel of this

1370
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:50,303
Just think it was absolutely critical to us

1371
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,911
Withholding some information that he's defrauding

1372
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
I think it was that

1373
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
ABC surprises

1374
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,335
You never will guess what I just found out

1375
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Yeah it was good

1376
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,199
In the movie I'm writing about this first off

1377
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,015
You and one

1378
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
Nicole Kidman is going to play Chris

1379
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Dena Maddie alright

You are going to but actually you can choose but you guys are going to fall in love at the end of this I'm sorry

1381
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
This is like I

1382
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,303
This is a Sleepless in Texas

1383
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
You do have the gender swap anybody where are you there brother

1384
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
EBird

1385
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,239
Ben Shapiro's going to be furious

1386
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,567
It's for the it's worth a big crab

1387
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,127
For you.

1388
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,503
We should probably wrap this up for too long but

1389
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,319
Yeah. So could we but we have other business

1390
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,135
Need to attend to and the

1391
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:50,719
Think I want to I want to touch back on is you said

1392
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
The 20th

1393
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
Is the next

1394
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
For y'all

1395
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,887
And then also the Posner case that's

1396
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,519
Do we have time frame on that

1397
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
I mean it's going to

1398
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,127
Come down to whether we're going to actually have to move the bankruptcy court to

1399
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
Done to the bankruptcy court

1400
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,711
Get free speech out of there

1401
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Weather

1402
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,295
So you know what screw it will sever it out

1403
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,927
Well system seems like it has enough hanging around its neck at this point

1404
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
You like that company might

1405
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,279
You know what I mean

1406
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
Yeah

1407
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,375
You had success in on suing those other end

1408
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,311
Free speech in bankruptcy

1409
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Do it

1410
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,687
I'm hoping you know I was hoping to have that Friday December for the anniversary

1411
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
I wanted it to be

1412
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Be over

1413
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039

I'm hoping for

1416
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:53,951
Oh my God

1417
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
And we'll get them done

1418
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
And then hopefully

1419
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Before the end of the spring

1420
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,423
The whole trial Saga of this is over

1421
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447

We look forward to say is that

1432
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
During the course of the trial itself and over the

1433
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
The weeks following it

1434
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,199
I received so much from your body

1435
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
