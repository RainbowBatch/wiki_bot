00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
I would like to know

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Quick question what's up

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Yes

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Tangiers parallon alright alright

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Is a Jew

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Because it's

12
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
It's me expressing some of my drives towards novelty what have you

13
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
The CVS

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
And I went

15
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
Inside and

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
4 CVS

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Remember this is

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
I saw a new beverage products

19
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
Coca-Cola

20
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
With coffee

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
No

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
No

23
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
That was my first instinct

24
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
Here's my second instinct

25
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Double nail

26
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,152
DoubleDown and I got it

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
Is very excited

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Rise by things in the past

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
Sure coffee Seltzer's really good really good

30
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Is a

31
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Disgusting

32
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
That's the worst thing I've ever heard anyone do to coffee

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Yep

34
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Bad

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,728
Grz2 try putting some cream and I was thinking about it

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
And actually I should be perfectly honest varieties of

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
The regular

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Okay

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
The other two are all three coffee though

40
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,952
God these I got all three

41
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,328
Problems already I got all three of those like what if they're amazing and now I've tried one

42
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Cuz I'm going to stare at the other two for a while

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
Not excited to drink those

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,872
Yeah maybe we could do that miserable drinking Coke

45
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
Batman

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Is that

47
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
On Saturday

48
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
I will be

49
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064

00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,648
My Final Fantasy 7

51
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,744
Project it will be done I couldn't do it last night

52
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Wednesday night

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,912
So I'm going to do a marathon on Saturday I'm almost at the end of the game I don't know how long

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176

00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,952
Please let's not get any better like maybe their special guest

59
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
No time you going to start okay

60
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
If you hear a rapping on your window at about 11:30 that's me it's me and I'm Play Drunk

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Crashing it through your window

62
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
You talking about

63
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
Wednesday and Thursday of this week that he's March 17th and 18th 20

64
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
This is a terrible idea that is I think it's over I think it's over because

65
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
You probably will

66
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,983
Yeah that whole thing was you I would never wish that busted by you winning

67
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Hold on what's that is somebody at the door

68
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Oh no

69
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Oh no

70
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
It is now that we don't know how that it works

71
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
So it's a little bit of time I have a couple of very important things

72
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
No, but actually I'm kind of shocked by what

73
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Doesn't,

74
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
And then we have one of Alex Jones is most

75
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Tacular flare-ups

By saying at the end of March we do a problem like God we're not going to be able to do this now

93
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,143
Keep track of this right

94
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
Let's try and give everybody birthday shout outs but never actually get to the name

95
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591

96
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
I've got no problem with this person and I hope they have a happy birthday

97
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
For your birthday we get Annex

99
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855

100
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,951

101
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Anyway happy birthday and congratulations on becoming a technocrats tattoo our beloved

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
Transdimensional chocolate male Vitality Raptor

And the Funky Homosapien how could you not enjoy both of those

107
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
So Jordan Wednesday and Thursday this week

108
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Was dreading this

109
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
What's Braden doing the show because I had a sense

110
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
That possibly Alex

111
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Would talk about the Atlanta shooting

112
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
Yes at the spa in Atlanta have left 8 dad

113
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
No interest in doing

114
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,207
Got no really complicated because there's a lot of issues to unpack

115
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
You know both

116
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
About the ante

117
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,935
Sex-worker ideas that are possibly motivating of the of the shooter and

118
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,519
Also certainly the violence towards asian-americans anyone who created

119
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
Fentanyl the Magic Dragon or whatever

120
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
Can shut the fuk up

121
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
Difficult with the information that we have available

122
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
But both of those

123
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
Things are things that intersect with Alex's World Mana

124
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,159
Kind of scary way and so far as he is misogynist and anti-aging

125
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Yes and I didn't want to deal with it

126
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
I was worried

127
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Get into it and

128
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
He doesn't bring it up at all

129
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Not on Wednesday

130
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Not as he makes a passing reference to being an incel on Thursday but he doesn't really talk about

131
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Incident at all

132
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
And so if he does

133
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
In the future will talk about it but for now I mean that my

134
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Ceiling is

135
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,575
Looking to get more information as it is becomes available and nothing is a horrible

136
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Started it show on Wednesday

137
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Aurora

138
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Get the f*** out

139
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
We will talk about this in a moment

140
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
So

141
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
I think that might be a little tasteless somebody help me that there is

142
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Asians is not high

143
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Go ahead and tell me that whenever this is

144
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,951
Just f****** available

145
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
You know even if

146
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Like

147
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
You even if

148
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Anti-asian sentiment wasn't what

149
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,519
Predominantly motivated this shooters

150
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
But even if that were the case if you're Alex Jones doing Infowars

151
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
I would think

152
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Hey what are we

153
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Put this off

154
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
The next day you're starting your show with a fentanyl the Chinese dragon

155
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367
How do you spell characters

156
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,255
The shooter was both motivated by misogyny so it's totally fine for me to disrespect to the victims

157
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
By being racist

158
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Yeah it's

159
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
It's weird

160
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
Tell Alex starts the show in Earnest it comes in

161
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
And he's got

162
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
I do not say this on are for dramatic effect I say it because it's the truth

163
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
We've absolutely gone into the side guys we are in for lack of a better

164
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,463
Revelation

165
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Out for a hike at the blood pumping in my brain

166
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,375
Complete and total clarity

167
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
Is it going to be about what aspect

168
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Recorded about 20 minutes

169
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Breakdown

170
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
What about the layout again

171
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
I was very calm how I did it and very cogent

172
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
I am so I am going to have that

173
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Video file

174
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
With a few documents in a few video clips but I'm going to air it

175
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Are the bottom of the next hour

176
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Tower

177
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
And 25 minutes it'll take two segments

178
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Tear

179
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
Talk about it ahead of time

180
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
But

181
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Everything I'm about to say is document

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
If you

183
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Don't

184
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
We catch what he's saying here's what's going on

185
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,151
Okay he took he took a hike that morning yeah they got some clarity up in his head

186
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Right

187
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Driving to the snow

188
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Studio on his phone

189
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
He recorded a 20-minute breakdown of whatever Vision he got while he was like

190
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
Yeah that sounded like what I was hearing and that baby deeply uncomfortable

191
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
Now he's going to talk about this stuff and then play the report that he's the recording of him on his phone right

192
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
30-minute comp

193
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,519
Prank call that it needs to get to recorded a nice little break for people

194
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Most reasonable explanation

195
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Yeah or you didn't never guess

196
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
To eat well that person's on air

197
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Anyway

198
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,439
The long and short of it I don't I don't want to spoil anything for you but it turns out the globalist

199
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Complaining

200
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
False

201
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Extinction in 2030

202
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
I think did you need to go on a hike

203
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
Like to get there

204
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
I don't know I honestly was looking at

205
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,895
It's kind of cute implies to me that Alex wants to live

206
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
You putting it off pretty far for it's like

207
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,111
Alex

208
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Yeah this is

209
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
It's not next month

210
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
It's not

211
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
2022

212
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
2030 man

213
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,239
Probably tired by that almost ate well somebody will hopefully have forced him to retire

214
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,359
This is that's kind of aspirational it's really frustrating to me because

215
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
Using a sweet position as far as doomsday cult leaders

216
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
Doomsday cult leaders go you don't like other

217
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Doomsday cult leaders

218
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,135
You can only predict the end of the world a few times and be wrong before people of time

219
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
How to get the

220
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
The gist here

221
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
We're on

222
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
That world is going to end on this date

223
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
2000

224
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
Happens all the time

225
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
What could be fake

226
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Swag Extinction also comforting

227
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
I guess okay

228
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Sweat bee

229
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
That's what Alex was calling on his

230
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Successful

231
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
You really don't even need a false flag for it right right

232
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,159
Anyway we'll get to that when we get to it

233
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
Yeah that was definitely the alright guys we got him

234
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,839
When you get to it and we'll get to it when he gets to it

235
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Before that he has to talk about he's got high-level sources sure give him really in-depth

236
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Mountain oh my God that yes and that's why

237
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
They have access to such

238
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Like

239
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Current

240
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Important information

241
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,575
Because they're radiating at that high high level frequency

242
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
Wings of time

243
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Wherever

244
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Everything's you can be out in the open now

245
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
That a national talk show host sent me minutes

246
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
Tucker

247
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Phone up and call Trump

248
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
I can pick the phone up and call Terry Carlson

249
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
I can pick the phone up and call

250
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
General Flynn

251
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
I can pick the phone up

252
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
And call Joe Rogan

253
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Pick the phone up and call

254
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Basically anybody

255
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
If I'm a good guy side it's just incredible

256
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Responsibility

257
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Real quick just a point of fact

258
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
Podcast

259
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543
Flagrant 2 or whatever the question one in Miami where there is actually video evidence that he can

260
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Let's just call Joe Rogan tries multiple times a Joe does not pick up feels a little bit like how I can say

261
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
Hey you know I can pick up my phone and tweeted anybody I wasn't right now

262
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
You have their number but

263
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Nobody's respond

264
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
I remember back when I used to produce a comedy show like we have people like

265
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
Hannibal Buress or Nickelodeon would come through town

266
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,447
And I would have their phone numbers because I was booked up on the show in the coordinating when they were going to arrive

267
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,311
Sometimes be drunk about eyes and a nose

268
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
I got I have Dave Attell in my phone when we work together forever

269
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
That I can do

270
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,111
Just call Dave Attell that's how it feels

271
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Exactly

272
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Yes

273
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
I was just at the throwing line

274
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Gender activist makes argument

275
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,167
All children to be put on puberty blockers until they can determine the identity

276
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Puberty blockers are toxic

277
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Put you into the system

278
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
That's what these monsters are they

279
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
Scientific Deckover

280
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,927
Leaving aside a lot of the finer points there was a story from December

281
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,279
So whoever Alex's cool media sources contacting him right before he got on air

282
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Maybe a little bit behind the times

283
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Or maybe they don't exist and Alex just recently heard about

284
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
This morning maybe one of his staffers

285
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Found it

286
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,359
Now it says reading his word for word the headline from an article in the Washington examiner from December 14th 2020

287
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
It has to do with something that was created by a YouTuber named Xenia Jones

288
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,783
Xenia was making what essentially amounts to a reducto out of

289
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,647
Absurdity of argument against the notion the trans U14 capable of giving informed consent

290
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
To take puberty blockers

291
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Dupree red quote

292
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,095
If children cannot consent to puberty blockers which caused any permanent changes even with the relevant

293
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Professional evaluation

294
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,727
How can make him sent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty

295
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
With no professional evaluation whatsoever

296
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
This was followed up with another tweet quote

297
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
An inability to offer informed

298
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Can sand or understand the long-term consequences

299
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
Is actually an argument for putting every single sis

300
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Damn transfers

301
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
On puberty blockers until they acquire that ability

302
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,207
Sure what does person was suggesting these pretty clear aims any explained as when they were reached

303
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
For comment by the washing

304
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Examiner

305
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
I was not making an argument that do youth should be given puberty blockers

306
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
This was not an actual proposal and it's not something I advocate or endorse

307
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
This was an argument that that claims of transients on readiness

308
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
To give consent to puberty blockers if followed consistently

309
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,455
Lead to the conclusion that all youth are likewise not ready for the experience of puberty itself

310
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,575
Because that conclusion is absurd again that was not something that I advocated or endorsed

311
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
The argument that

312
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
Trans Youth Camp consent to puberty blockers asphalt

313
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
That makes total sense

314
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
Explain the arguments being made here is structurally fine

315
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
But the argument isn't advancing

316
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,703
It's good to put all use on Peabody blockers I have clearly stated in the article that Alex's

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Hidden arguments

318
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,335
Specifically designed to illustrate a counterexample that shows the flaw in an already existing argue

319
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Videos tweets

320
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
Where in response to the United Kingdom

321
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Supreme Court decision that quote

322
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:01,599
There will be enormous difficulties in a child under 16 understanding and weighing up this information and deciding whether to

323
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Consent to use

324
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Of puberty blocking medication

325
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
Only make sense

326
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
In light of that contact

327
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
Yeah these please put I believe in good faith contends isn't absurd implications a logic

328
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Being used by the UK Court

329
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,823
Unfortunately from a purely logical standpoint the argument put forth isn't super effect

330
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Active in this case

331
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Fresenius argument to hold water

332
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
We would need to somehow illustrate

333
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,807
Howdy proceeding of a naturally occurring process and the intervention in that naturally turn process

334
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Require the same level of consent which is going to be

335
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Yeah

336
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
They did

337
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Though I do recall

338
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
Xenia saying that she wanted to eat the Irish

339
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,887
And that she did they did standby that I know Alex has an expert in

340
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
Swifty and Sapphire

341
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,591
F****** Irish self-soothe having access to puberty blockers

342
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,711
The logic of zinnias argument just has a hole that could be easily exploited by people arguing against Steph

343
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
But otherwise

344
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
Alright anyway Alex is mad about this 33 months later and he's opening his show bragging about how one of the super

345
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
Local media friends brought it to his attention

346
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Tomorrow's news today

347
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah I do like

348
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Hearing about tweet

349
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Tweets from 3 months

350
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
To go see house you're my favorite news stories

351
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,239
Also the whole thing there were Alex's hanging puberty blockers were linked to lot C

352
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
2 deaths

353
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Understanding of it at all

354
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
I looked into it and it turns out Alex's passing along

355
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Fake news no in September 2019 a bunch of right-wing Christian sites

356
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,647
Posting articles about how a drug used as puberty blocker for transients called Lupron

357
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
I've been linked to oversee

358
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
6000

359
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,351
This headline was flashing and it led to articles all over right-wing media and places like lifesitenews and daily wire

360
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,447
Ben Shapiro retreated in the claim went viral all over social media

361
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
The drug had been linked

362
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,103
2 / 6000 that's what the problem is that Lupron is not just a drug that's given to transfuse

363
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
According to NBC News quote

364
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:06,015
3000 people who died while taking these drugs are likely determine Ali ill cancer patient

365
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
To receive hormone blockers

366
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
The fight hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer

367
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
According to

368
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
A wolf that's hardly fair

369
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Right

370
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,303
The underlying FDA data that was used by these blogs to show the therapist

371
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
6370 deaths over the past 40 years there were patients who are on Lupron

372
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
That's all they they were using

373
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,287
From there they just assumed that all these patients were transfused as opposed to

374
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Do terminally ill cancer patient

375
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
And decided to create a

376
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Duplicitous fraudulent Auntie trans narrative out of

377
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,015
I'll bet anything that I was just saw this headline back when it's being posted on social media

378
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
You never thought to look into it or understand the matter further

379
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Cuz he's dumb and lazy

380
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
You know 50 years from now I bet

381
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
The Japanese will improve upon it

382
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
And call it Lupron the Third

383
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,327
Come on

384
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Oh you don't even get that reference at Aldi

385
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
I don't know if I should pretend I get it or just

386
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,823
Okay loop loop on the 3rd so it's based off of our sin loop on French

387
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Cat burglar the famous French cat

388
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
Oh yeah

389
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
50 years later and in Japan called loop on the 3rd

390
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
Forgive me for not knowing my anime and famous French

391
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
Cat burglar history did Lupin the Third

392
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
It was incredible

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,864
I'm sure it is it's okay it's a hole in my cultural awareness

394
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Few people get it and they will f******

395
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Can shih tzus intensity of that book you gave me was really scared

396
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
Anyway Alex's is

397
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Is full of

398
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Bad information in already

399
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
XO you know it did this clip like this kind of his

400
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
A little funny

401
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,184
The average Westerner has less attention span than a goldfish

402
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
But their subconscious brain and their conscious brain

403
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
That basically been murdered where there

404
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Why jellyfish

405
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
I'm a sleeper

406
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
Must awake

407
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
EMDR

408
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
What's the politician they chocolate very

409
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Very

410
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Slowly

411
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
And they talk

412
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Very

413
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Very

414
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Softly

415
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
I don't want anyone in PR

416
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
Talk to him excited voice

417
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
I would say that it excited voice like that actually distract from the glaring holes in the information being yell

418
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
Okay there might be that I will a meteor

419
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,968
Italy become the greatest left-wing commentator there is in Alex's eyes I guess

420
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
I mean I think that there is a a lot of

421
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
People who make up

422
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
If we riding over performing

423
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
That would be me say I'm literally word for word

424
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
Performance and is Showmanship or whatever is designed

425
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
In order to make up for distract people

426
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
From the fact that he doesn't know anything it wasn't making all this s***

427
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,592
One could argue most people who scream are often

428
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
To doing that

429
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Yeah

430
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,736
Broad loop on the 3rd

431
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Anyway

432
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
This next week

433
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
This is great man

434
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
This is this is where I live

435
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
I like I like people who are happy

436
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
I like it when people are happy

437
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Even people I dislike

438
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Like Alex

439
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,400
I'd rather I'd rather everyone be happy cuz I'm positive vibes emanating out to the universe

440
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,240
A real good mood because magic happened in his loving

441
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
You want on that hike

442
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
I need an idea

443
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
Right and then listen to what happened

444
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
The crew they're amazing

445
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
We've all had dreams that come true

446
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
This morning

447
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,424
I cut an audio recording dealing with the globalist plan to have a stage in the world event

448
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Have you forgotten

449
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640

450
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,968

451
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,064

456
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
Looked up and they were punching up

457
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
This background of a satellite of the Earth

458
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
We probably do this twice a year

459
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Printer

460
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
The headline

461
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Globalist

462
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640

The biggest download I've ever gotten on the hike I just done

466
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928

467
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
They're going to stay

468
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
And she didn't think I was crazy cuz she seen

469
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Okay that's why that's why

470
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,128
Download into my brain that they're going to fake the end of the world of 2030

471
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Okay

472
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456

This conversation

521
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248

Almost half of them refuse to get vaccinated

526
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
And him saying

527
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,072

This would be a really good time to just be like

536
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Alright

541
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,968
No problem you're a bad guy

542
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
And I'm going to be against you

543
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
That's that

544
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,368
Wonder Wheel the economy. Okay it was just a vaccine

546
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,120
I always like everybody needs to get it

547
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Oh

548
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
I think he sees an off-ramp

549
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,056
There's no hope of trump really ever becoming president

550
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
How were there really

551
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,408
The movement or whatever it's

552
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Splinter

553
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
Sheridan hate each other yeah

554
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Yeah yeah

555
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,112
There is a possibility of coalescing again but it's not going to be around Trump

556
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Trump Juniors a

557
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:53,536
Trucking

558
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,608
Think they're running into the problem that a lot of would be monarch

559
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
I've run into witches

560
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Is that their children are

561
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Stupid

562
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
Incredibly

563
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
So right and that's why

564
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
That's okay if you're already Amano

565
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
Exactly you can't stop it going down

566
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
Straight Caesar on this guy

567
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,600
Yeah and so you know I think I think the chopper are Alex realizes that

568
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
There's value in maintaining like I did

569
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
Make a huge mistake with last few years but this is a line too far right now

570
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:34,496
I think we may see that unfortunately I wouldn't be surprised if he could

571
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Could carve out a better

572
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Space for moving forward by being the

573
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,920
It's the crazy guy who's also anti-trump now like

574
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
I mean he could have

575
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,064
This whole time probably but also like one of things I think is interesting is he take

576
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Eventually

577
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
I miss show and the next show in like no one

578
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Cares

579
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
No one is like a what what's a

580
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
How you're talkin bad about Trump

581
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:03,936
They've all moved on to that he was just an avatar for their hatred and desire to kill them

582
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Apparently can

583
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Exist without him so they realize they don't need him

584
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
Hypno create another

585
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Anyway Alex

586
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Patted him on the head

587
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
Alex Jones Show

588
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Talk about Trump

589
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,952
It doesn't mean that I won't say he's good on topics we should take over the Republican Party

590
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,888
Dropping congratulated my wife we got married all that great stuff

591
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,312
Broadcaster and I'm going to take over for Rush Limbaugh

592
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
I only kept the eclipse

593
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
Because Alex is definitely not mad the Dan bongino took over

594
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Very insulting thing to him

595
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
Specifically

596
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
Not even a little bit mad at all about Dan bongino taking the spot that he considers

597
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Is rectally

598
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,400
Isaac most radio station

599
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
Yeah definitely not mad

600
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Yeah

601
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,176
He's media contact reach out to him and told them about this three-month-old tweet

602
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
Alex also has some information he's been trying

603
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
To get out

604
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
To his media contacts it where you know it's over a year old

605
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
Tell you something here

606
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
We cover so much huge nose continually

607
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,912
This is critical for me and you and all of it to continually

608
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
Constantly realize how huge this is

609
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Huge

610
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
Because it's easier to get live on Aaron cover while stuff cuz it's live

611
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
Slick Rick

612
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
10 * the views online

613
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,160
I didn't know about this

614
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
I finally have read

615
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,120
A month off and on spending 30 minutes 10 minutes

616
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Read this entire folder

617
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
And

618
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Greek researchers

00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
New report on this everybody else that's time

620
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
Whatever every want you to different ports on this because

621
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Every time I read this

622
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
3 *

623
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
Doubt it

624
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Doubt it

625
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Time I look at this

626
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
New stuff

627
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Mentally exhausted

628
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Very scientific.

629
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
And this is a small portion this

630
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Pages or more

631
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Crimson Contagion

632
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
If you get

633
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Mentally exhausted reading

634
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Scientific papers. Maybe you should

635
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Birria

636
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Signs of a paper

637
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
Yeah I don't I don't know

638
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,160
Crimson contagion we talked about on the last episode York Times article report

639
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,304
Dirigo some stuff

640
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,376
And now he's ready to eat actually really good town into Egypt

641
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
Complaints

642
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
About how his media friends don't want to cover

643
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Crimson Contagion

644
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
The 10 minutes after day

645
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Action Amanda video

646
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
To say bombshell will call the show bombshell

647
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
You're not

648
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,256
Ashley sent this

649
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
Leaving talk show host in the country all of them

650
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Might want to do that

651
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
The other two guys

652
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Believable

653
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,016
I think if they're saying I'm busy you covered cuz they know it came out a year ago so far

654
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,576
Right I mean that has to be the explanation

655
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
This is this is nothing new.

656
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
Would have enough sense to realize

657
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
You shouldn't be talking

658
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
About this

659
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
This looks bad for Trump

660
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
This looks real bad

661
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,128
Spin it you kind of need to exist within like a fully-realized

662
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:33,248
Conspiracy world you can't have a foot in reality you have to create a

663
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Complete

664
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Isolated

665
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Kidspace

666
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Where you can pull off a

667
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Actually it was

668
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Was the globalist

669
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Display

670
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,560
Tucker is trying to pretend he still lives in the shared reality we all live in

671
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,864
He gave up on that elude a long time ago

672
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
We got to Agenda 21

673
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
You remember that

674
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,544
Agenda 2030 Maybe

675
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:01,664
Now there's a genda 20:35 I like that

676
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
Planet

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
I gave us life

678
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,112
And then there's the rest of the levels going to be operation

679
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
If you were among the first we supposed to 20

680
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Oops

681
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
An hour exposing agenda

682
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
2030

683
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
What comes after agenda 2030

684
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,128
Deltron 3030 first time ever going to hear next hour

685
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
20

686
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
30

687
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Peter Denny autumn

688
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
It will be no humans

689
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
As we were down today

690
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
Left on Earth

691
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,488
14

692
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
That seems like a bad play

693
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
It's it's

694
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
Complete nonsense

695
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
Makes up a new agenda

696
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
Mansa Musa

697
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
30 is actually real

698
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
I didn't choose the name of like

699
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Summer

700
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
But at Jeddah 2035 I think

701
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,040
Entirely Alex is on creation. I like that you can create where it's at

702
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
We can create agenda

703
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
So what time is agendas is

704
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
You know

705
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,512
I've never watched any of the

706
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
Freddy Krueger movies

707
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Sure

708
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:28,960
Do you watch those movies I watch The Nightmare on Elm Street or two I know that they take place in the realm of Dreams

709
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
They do and you shouldn't f***

710
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:38,176
If you f****** a nightmare Freddy going to get you at Freddy's going to get you

711
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,784
Alex lives in that space to a lot you know these Visions when he's on hikes

712
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Ed apparently I would think that a lot of

713
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
The stuff that he

714
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
He does weather for good or bad

715
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
May be driven by some

716
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Conscious things

717
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
That he might not understand

718
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,936
Oh I would argue that also conscious things he does not understand

719
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,032
Context in mind this is about how if you getting

720
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
An abortion

721
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,616
Then you'll be fine with killing old people in

722
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
Slippery slope

723
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
And then I would start talking about his own history of pain

724
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
For abortions

725
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
And he says

726
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Some stuff that makes me really uncomfortable

727
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Truck coming out and doing this

728
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
Crossing the Rubicon

729
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
A major push

730
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
They say it's not a baby

731
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
Monroe bway 97

732
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,664
Tens of millions of women getting abortion

733
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
Uterine cancer cervical cancer

734
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Ovarian cancer

735
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
What's good

736
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Crime against God

737
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
You don't get God to forgive your servant of evil

738
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Once you're on that track

739
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Would you admit you pay for abortions

740
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
That's horrible

741
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Swear to God

742
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
When I was like

743
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
17 years old

744
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Now.

745
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
I would not

746
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Do that again

747
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
Years without even dating

748
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
And an In-N-Out

749
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,608
Great to know

750
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
And I

751
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Painted himself

752
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
For the positive light

753
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,648
That'll show him the children as they grow up and how beautiful they were

754
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Hold this little baby in my hands

755
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Incredible sign

756
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,912
Your son was an inch

757
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Got your ass

758
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
Has delivered me and cleanse me of what I did

759
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,280
So he was holding as his

760
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
Tadpole

761
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Not even

762
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Not even that

763
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Still borderline Andover

764
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
Meaning of itself and then the devil ate it

765
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
And the devil laid in front of

766
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Bugatti

767
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,664
Alex said he has nightmares that God shows him these kids

768
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,248
Apparently gotten sending these nightmares where the devil

769
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
D2 trials in front of him

770
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
I've somehow Alex is like a god

771
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Forgiven me I protected everything's fine

772
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
Because torture is being my drink

773
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
That's how you keep Alex in line

774
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Okay if you're God you've chosen Alex defeat the Devil and you can't let the

775
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Strafe

776
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
From the bath

777
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
So you got to send them cons

778
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,776
Terrifying threatening nightmares to make

779
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
Make sure he knows you love him

780
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
I look at this from a more

781
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't know materialistic

782
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
Perspective

783
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Sure

784
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Spell icup

785
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
See your stoneheart right now

786
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
I kind of

787
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
See this as a thing

788
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Alex

789
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Mayfield tremendous amounts of guilt

790
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,512
Wow about things that he opposition to abortion

791
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
Demonic Miss of it

792
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,352
Maybe a lot of it might be a byproduct

793
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
Of how terrible he feels about himself

794
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Sure sure

795
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
More importantly

796
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
This is what I want to say

797
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
No

798
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
This is not cool

799
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
This isn't cool is bad

800
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,759
This isn't good for a new show this isn't good for an editorial show isn't good

801
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
As analysis of anything real bad

802
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,623
It's maybe has a place as like

803
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Mid-range

804
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Televangelist

805
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
I could see that

806
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
Local television

807
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,471
He doesn't have a private jet but he can afford a tour bus somewhere under the

808
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
The Jack Van Impe level

809
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,407
Yeah I just has to be really bizarre that anybody would listen to this and just be like

810
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
Mayonnaise guy gets

811
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,295
He's talking about are rambling about how he has Visions at night of his

812
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,879
Babies that he paid for abortions the bed the devil eat them

813
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
And Alex gets mad and

814
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
God it just like

815
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
It's hard to take a man seriously who says we've got big news

816
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,191
To get into and then later on goes to be like I had a dream and let me tell it to you and exhausting.

817
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
Details on board child to punish me or talk to me and God welcome that dream into my head

818
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Alright

819
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Subway

820
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
So I meant like I really got this f****** weird sense about him

821
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
That is

822
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Nuts

823
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
And this is not

824
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,559
Coming up in the next two segments that key report on the globalist plan

825
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:20,959
Rolled into the world in or around the year 2030 learn what agenda

826
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
20/35 is exclusively

827
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
Seriously

828
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
It was 25 years ago it's all come true

829
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
A lot of contacts a lot of sources but

830
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Above basically any of those sources

831
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
Except for the fuel the top level

832
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
The only people outside the top globalist

833
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Leadership

834
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Actually have all the contacts all the info

835
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
Two-seater complete master plan

836
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
And I'd literally

837
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Okay

838
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
The only only Alex

839
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,871
And like King globulus

840
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,431
Yeah actually know what's going on

841
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
Nobody else in the world could even see through

842
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
I'm listening to him like this is

843
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:12,159
Rank narcissism somebody having a breakdown of some kind

844
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,231
Like that this is not a well person

845
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Existing in

846
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,399
In space no no generally speaking as as a bipolar bipolar 1

847
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,215
Delusions of grandeur usually a

848
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Big size

849
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
That stuff is going on

850
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,359
He has he has delusions of grandeur on it

851
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Semi-regular basis

852
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:38,015
I don't even know if I would categorize it as like feeling because like there's also this

853
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Dislike

854
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
No it be malignant narcissism

855
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
It's bad

856
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
Truly if I'm the globalists and I know this

857
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
You got a killer

858
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,887
I mean you do there's no big deal

859
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,775
Whatever backlash you might get from killing them is going to be worse than having

860
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,823
Him know your entire plan

861
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
I mean like everybody

862
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,039
Conspiracy world still believes that like

863
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
The man killed Bill Cooper

864
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,743
Total and it didn't unravel any globalist plot

865
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
You know that cuz they killed him

866
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
That was just what would happen if the global killed Alex to accuse the only person who can

867
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,703
Can see through everything and understand everything how to do it

868
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
It's not like anybody else

869
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Arapaima globalist

870
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:37,407
Even even if I'm a pacifist globalist do you know like I don't want to solve my problems

871
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Buy a murder

872
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
This is a special circumstance you're just got to do it yeah I think what you've done is provide

873
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,671
A pretty decent argument for why there are no Global us

874
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,559
If they were as demonic at his Cutthroat after working on a thousand year plan

875
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Galaxy

876
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
Yeah they would have literally no reason to hold back

877
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,495
And even if you have the protection of God but God you've got protection

878
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
Is the one sending you weird Demonite Mary how are you

879
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
No big deal

880
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Yeah

881
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
Get down to business doing what he does best

882
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
Best witches reading headlines

883
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
And just saying about them

884
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
No analysis at all

885
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Where should I

886
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Start the segment have this big

887
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,887
Let's go ahead and just read headlines in the vaccine stack

888
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
From today overhead shot please

A year and 3 months ago

891
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,431
It's the end of humanity and maybe it's for the best

892
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
Time says get rid of

893
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
That's a religion

894
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:51,647
This headline Metallica's reading on Aries real but it's in the New York Times book review section

895
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,255
It's the title of a review of a novel novel by Guido Marcelli titled

896
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,583
Ahg which is published in 1977

897
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:05,727
The plot has to do with a suicidal man realizing that all the rest of the humanity has disappeared and he's the last human around

898
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,615
Hey newberry's absentee waxes philosophical and also notices that nature is taking over what was previously City

899
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
From the review quote

900
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:18,271
Beneath the philosophical Welter a new world Glitters with prelapsarian strange

901

Gangs of Plum cats rate administrative lobbies

902

ShamWow guy

903
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
Prince along train tracks

Felix's Gray's Hotel lawn

905
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
I sort of one-man Utopias

906
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Possible

907
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
The phone isn't Strivers Argon

908
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,399
The city's churches Banks and military installations lie abandoned

909
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
An index of Empires ruin

910
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
Is the work of fiction that was reviewed in the New York Times book section and Alex is trying to pass it off as some kind of news article open

911
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
10 piece

912
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,711
This is beyond the kind of sloppiness they would get anyone fired anywhere else than

913
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Infowars

914
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:53,343
What the f*** is wrong with this s*** man and I've got a breaking news story for him

915
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
This comes from the 90s

916
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
And

917
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
There was a piece published

918
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
Where a guy specifically said

919
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
That it was the end of the world

920
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
As he knew it

921
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:11,263
I remember the kids f***** up you know when you think about it it's the end of the world and this guy feels by

922
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Do you know what that means

923
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Pop

924
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
Globalist

925
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,479
I think he also predicted Like a Hurricane

926
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
And then he'll listen to himself Church

927
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
I get rubber later tonight so

928
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
A long time

929
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
You've been teasing this

930
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
This a report

931
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
That you recorded in

932
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,607
The car on the way to the studio with you were so

933
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
Shallow about his

934
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
Is Vision but he was like

935
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
So

936
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Infant teething

937
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,663
After reading a slew of headlines

938
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
How far into the episode are we

939
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
I'm not sure

940
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,575
Maybe 2 hours couple hours at lunch time

941
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Forget about her

942
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,719
Hugo's

943
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
Okay good

944
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,863
Pecos and they play a special report

945
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Sound sound like

946
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,983
What he was describing about agenda 2035

947
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,775
Or any of that stuff

948
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Intelligent

949
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
No special report

950
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
Commercial and then it comes back

951
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
Bike down for this

952
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
Amazing freak out

953
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:32,927
That I will actually tell you is out of the version of it

954
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,839
Our lights are going on around here at the office and I do use lizards our Focus that's fine

955
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,935
Appreciate that you heard me say brand Airlines 2035 report we come back

956
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
I just went off and had lunch

957
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,919
Oh hell was that about

958
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
20:35

959
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,855
It's coming up it's coming up

960
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Computer that put

961
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
Maybe I should just quit

962
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
Thinking about

963
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
I just walk out of here

964
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
And they do a better job at never see me again

965
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Because I can either

966
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,295
Coming on

967
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,111
To talk about how this is a massive crime against humanity

968
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
Biological weapons attack on Humanity

969
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,975
And the master plan

970
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
Also said I'm going to have the support

971
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,431
Promoted promoted

972
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
Trying to understand

973
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
I'm the worst

974
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
Discovery broadcast for a while

975
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,599
Just bugs

976
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
What's your Governor Newsom

977
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,895
Man

978
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,199
I just like

979
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
This is

980
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
Add a certain point

981
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
This isn't the show anymore this is a guy breaking down

982
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,159
I feel bad laughing about it but I hated him

983
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
And it's kind of funny

984
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Also

985
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Did it just occurred to you

986
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,607
To write out a f****** script

987
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
Or something an outline right

988
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,471
That is all that's what the military

989
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,799
That's what all good shows do

990
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,359
It's called like producing

991
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,943
Yeah and so he asked to give a little bit of an apology obvious

992
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,271
Play any explains

993
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,599
Fds that was a real freak out on there earlier

994
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,207
Because it's normal when world government is coming in and setting up Global passports

995
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,303
Inoculation to doing it to newborn baby

996
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,167
I wasn't clear about hearing that report I guess to them

997
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
And

998
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
Report coming on

999
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,455
Really meme

1000
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Myself in the face

1001
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
But I am mad at myself I wish I did a better job

1002
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Yeah me too

1003
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,903
Man I just love this as a bookend

1004
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,047
Cuz the episode begins with him talking about how great it was that the crew psychically knew the video that he wanted to play

1005
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Yep

1006
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
Beautiful

1007
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
You know what I'm going to tell you this right now

1008
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,103
I'm going to tell you this right now my Stone Cold Heart

1009
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,247
Not wrong I said I said it on the show that we're premiering this report at a certain time right

1010
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:46,623
I guess the producers are listening to the show to get that report ready

1011
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,927
Maybe we should have talked about this

1012
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
Before the show started

1013
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
I love it though

1014
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
And

1015
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,471
I don't care anymore about that guy

1016
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,823
Because you do you have this whole thing where it's like okay for months were talking about how

1017
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,967
The coronavirus itself is a bioweapon the fauci made in this lab and now we're going to be doing the

1018
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,783
Vaccine is a bioweapon the fauci

1019
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
I'm tired boring

1020
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
Francis Boyle

1021
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Royal

1022
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
Boil

1023
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Apologies

1024
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,463
Frustrates me

1025
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,535
Because if you are named Francis Boyle

1026
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
I assume you have been knighted

1027
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
I don't know why

1028
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:35,263
But if your name is Francis Boyle it better be Sir Francis Boyle because Arthur Conan Doyle

1029
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Ugly but it didn't sound right

1030
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
Right yeah

1031
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
To hear what I'm going to call the Larry Nichols mistake

1032
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:52,159
Permission to give out his phone number on the website to help with legal advice

1033
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,231
4 to assist

1034
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,535
Their lawyers cuz you are is not license

1035
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
Practice in one state

1036
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,935
But he'll advise their lawyers on how to help them not get vaccinated

1037
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
I don't care

1038
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Francis Boyle

1039
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:12,895
We jump to the 18th now cuz I didn't review goes and I thought it would be funny not to cover his

1040
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
Report

1041
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
Cuz it's it's a 0

1042
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,087
Brother honestly more pressing issues like this

1043
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
That Alex

1044
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Gets into the beginning of his March

1045
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Show

1046
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,511
All of the place the leaders of the lgbtq movement

1047
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Arrested

1048
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
There's the truth is

1049
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
It wasn't about gay marriage was always about sex

1050
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,519
With your children

1051
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
Ritual

1052
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
To drain author energy

1053
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Android off there

1054
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Future

1055
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,039
The only like better is chopping your children up with a meat cleaver while they rape

1056
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,879
What the big boys do

1057
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:58,207
So this is the kind of moment that you might describe as a mask off

1058
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Scituate

1059
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,327
I'll pretend he's a Libertarian and then he doesn't

1060
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
Care what people do in their bedroom underneath all that belief is this

1061
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
Switches

1062
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
The classical propan

1063
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Homophobic

1064
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,103
Put this in context Alex's found a story about a judge in Wisconsin named Brett blomme

1065
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,431
Who was arrested on suspicion of uploading child pronography to web

1066
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,087
He apparently was a family court judge and it's normally been the president of an organization called Cream City Foundation

1067
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
Which of the philanthropic Organization advocating for members of the LG

1068
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
G b t q + community

1069
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
And in the past that Foundation is sponsored some drag queen Story Hour events so naturally this is being presented in right-wing media

1070
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,143
Is this guy being the head of dragon

1071
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Queen Story Hour

1072
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
What Alex is doing is engaging in select

1073
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
2 coverage

1074
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:48,127
He makes a big deal out of every time that someone in a group of people he wants to attack gets arrested for a horrible crime

1075
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:53,759
Read more the other instances where the perpetrator is someone who's a member of a group that he doesn't want to portray as evil

1076
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
When there's a school shooting

1077
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,623
It's just an individual doing a terrible thing it in those cases

1078
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:03,231
I don't fully understand how bad it could be to engage in Collective blame for individual a

1079
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:09,631
Most of his career is based on gallon about how gun owners will be blamed for things like Sandy Hook or the Las Vegas shooting

1080
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
We have to resist that also

1081
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Get guns taken

1082
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,335
But when you get right down to it Alex does the far worse version of ascribing collective blame for the actions of individuals

1083
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,431
Because he's doing it to Moline and attack historically marginalized groups

1084
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Two people

1085
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,039
Any immigrant committing a crime becomes proof that immigrants are all criminals and killers

1086
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
The crimes of any gay person becomes proof

1087
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
That the lgbtq rights movement is secretly about

1088
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Potranco sex

1089
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
With kids

1090
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,559
I'm certain most listeners don't need this bailed out but this is profoundly dangerous

1091
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,887
Because what is coupling the perception of criminality

1092
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:45,983
With an entire group of people based on the actions of individual who's a member of that group

1093
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
And this

1094
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Is just unacceptable

1095
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Now that's

1096
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,639
That's just so f*****

1097
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
It just doesn't it

1098
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
It just never ends no matter how much f******

1099
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Violence we see

1100
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
On a daily basis

1101
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
It is still a man

1102
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Out there trying to get

1103
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
People

1104
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
Attacked

1105
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
And it's just so f***

1106
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
So

1107
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:20,799
We're not going to dwell too much on that because like a lot of that does surround like a lot of the turtle

1108
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
Gross stuff

1109
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
Did Alex say I do

1110
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,759
I don't expect him to Tampa replay on our show but that Rose to a level of like

1111
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,599
Okay Alex's saying that the children of lgbtq

1112
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,647
Seacube rights movement in the push

1113
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
For gay marriage

1114
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,975
Was actually secretly about trying to have sex

1115
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
For kids

1116
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
A Moment Like That

1117
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,095
Does deserve a place of honor show because

1118
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
It reveals

1119
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,423
Something that's under the surface of his is

1120
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Is

1121
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
Worldview his is belief

1122
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
That's f***** up

1123
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
It's alright he's

1124
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
That's that's where he's at

1125
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Yeah

1126
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
And it's it's

1127
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,687
Even more explicit than whenever he was like

1128
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
Lgbtq

1129
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
Tqp or whatever it was

1130
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
I swear he's trying to add that in there

1131
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
And it's just

1132
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
It's just

1133
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,791
So Alex is that

1134
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Biden

1135
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
I said some tough word

1136
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
About Putin

1137
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,471
And I get the sense

1138
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
From list

1139
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,775
Make this episode March 18th

1140
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,335
Did there's a there's a sentiment Alex

1141
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Love's

1142
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,991
Real probe the Monarch that he wishes would take over the United

1143
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
I think he wishes

1144
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
Just drop was more like bolsonaro or

1145
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:41,183
Quite frankly I think he would rather one of them invade the United States

1146
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,023
He wanted a god-king strongman instead he got a

1147
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Grifter

1148
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,375
Got a front man for the mob exactly and so now he

1149
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,447
He's like oh look at what could have been we could have had a

1150
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,519
30-year monstrosity of a Russian Roulette

1151
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
He's going back to that

1152
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,407
Wendy's on

1153
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Amazon Channel TV

1154
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Buses going to pay soon

1155
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
And that they're going to be coming after

1156
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,463
And that

1157
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Look in the mirror

1158
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,119
Let's talk about what

1159
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
Alaska

1160
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Ears over and over again

1161
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
He pulled troops out of all he's ever places

1162
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
Elijah National

1163
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,711
Organic Drive Sonoma Supply roller

1164
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
The cleaner fossil fuels

1165
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,367
Marriage and Christianity

1166
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,927
And they are decrying the

1167
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,487
Foundation Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation

1168
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Foundation

1169
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,863
They're saying they want to post human world and that Russia is not for

1170
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
It's so funny to me because like last weekend I was watching

1171
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
Alex's documentaries

1172
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Prepon

1173
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
Some stuff

1174
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:11,551
Storm I believe of Sentara start together cuz they're

1175
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
He was talking about how he

1176
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
He had proven

1177
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,927
Bomb does apartment build

1178
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
I mean it's not hard

1179
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:25,631
DIY 2K episode that he was talking about

1180
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,959
Putin looks like a demon he's going to seize power at all

1181
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
I just I don't know it's weird

1182
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
Weird

1183
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
It doesn't it doesn't mean anything it's just wherever the wind blows with my prejudices today

1184
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,039
That's a long as you stick within the relative

1185
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
Boundaries of those prejudices Elsa

1186
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
Support you forever but if

1187
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:50,719
You Breakaway like say you support vaccines then your f****** done

1188
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:56,095
Yeah and I think he recognizes that Putin is a leader that would

1189
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
Protect the thing

1190
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
Better important to him which is

1191
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,519
Absurd of heteronormative white

1192
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:08,383
Consider the matter

1193
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
Of course

1194
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Alex

1195
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
I like it when it gets a little heady

1196
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
But I like this even more

1197
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,239
Directions from 2000 plus years ago from sings 4000-5000 years old

1198
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
Tells the same story

1199
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,079
India

1200
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,175
Thousand-year-old hieroglyph China

1201
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,735
6000 year old stone carving

1202
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
The tell the same story

1203
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
A story we'll talk about

1204
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Here

1205
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
In just one moment

1206
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
The story of

1207
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,071
Let's talk about keeping the broadcast on the air

1208
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:04,447
I want to see if you off your support

1209
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Make a lot of money

1210
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,543
Promise operation whenever on a structure on cruise

1211
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
I love it

1212
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
I feel like you slept

1213
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:16,735
Me and my face three times over the course of all history about the same story

1214
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:21,343
And I will explain it to you after

1215
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
That's the real story that's

1216
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Been told beautiful over and over again

1217
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,047
Sounds does a really really long plug

1218
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
A fairly long talk

1219
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
I don't know what's longer

1220
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,887
Anymore

1221
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,471
My radar

1222
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
But he hasn't he has a bit of a plug

1223
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,311
And

1224
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
Gets into what I think maybe is what the message

1225
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
Batavians we're all about

1226
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
Okay

1227
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,943
What do you do this

1228
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,551
Cuz I can't in 5 minutes for 6 minutes do it justice in this segment

1229
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Humanoid

1230
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
What that mean

1231
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,023
How much how many times I've told you about

1232
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
Dick this

1233
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,703
They admitted to producing humanoids

1234
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,983
50 years ago

1235
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
50 years

1236
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,591
What about 50 years ago humanoids were already created

1237
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
About humanoids

1238
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
50

1239
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,343
DC movies

1240
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,655
I mean we are we already know about the fish people with that human eyes

1241
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,471
Naturally and then now we have

1242
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Returns of replicas

1243
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,031
It's walking around

1244
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,615
Oh yeah

1245
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
I don't know

1246
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Iowa

1247
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,223
Was going to take this seriously this house

1248
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,551
To do with you no more stories about like

1249
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Advance

1250
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Ventura being made in

1251
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Replacement Oregon

1252
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,903
Technology

1253
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,999
I was going to take it seriously but then he said there's anyway come out

1254
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Nnn

1255
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,559
Promise

1256
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,095
But Joe Biden and

1257
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Bye-bye

1258
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,215
Little nasty dudes technology

1259
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Bible calls a demon

1260
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
Promise live extension but they

1261
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
First got to kill us

1262
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
And test

1263
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,343
You better hurry up for Tristan

1264
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
Thanks to us because

1265
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
We grow into them what we do

1266
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
Pure

1267
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
And it come together as a species

1268
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
A bird that is a knock

1269
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,375
This is actually a giant

1270
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Genetic war on the planet

1271
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
Set up for this song

1272
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Just like you should get ready

1273
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
For that

1274
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,591
If there's a story about some scientific

1275
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
Breakthrough

1276
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,455
Some kind of scientific it's going on

1277
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
I find that interesting

1278
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:01,599
But I don't care to talk about it realistically when it's being presented to me

1279
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
Is part of

1280
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Plot

1281
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,487
Where Joe Biden is going to get life-extension technology

1282
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
Who is Promised by a demon right

1283
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
They're nasty dudes

1284
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
Notre Dame

1285
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,239
Call demons in the Bible but there are other worlds

1286
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,799
Are you a nasty enough dude

1287
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:27,199
To extend the president's life is a question that

1288
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,271
Yeah I just don't like one once this

1289
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,367
Is the realm or in any real conversation doesn't matter

1290
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,951
Aliens or demons

1291
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Nobody I'm out

1292
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Also I just

1293
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,143
Anytime he says pure

1294
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,935
I don't want him to

1295
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,799
Expand upon that we all know it's better if he leaves it alone

1296
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,127
Stay away from the even said he shouldn't be allowed to say the word pure

1297
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,247
Comes off his lips correlate

1298
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,039
Pure o.j.

1299
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,903
What does that mean is it white inside what do you want

1300
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
Impurity that he's dog not I think he means fully

1301
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,071
I think he does although I do

1302
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
People in his community have it

1303
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
Healthy relationship

1304
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,751
But I think he's talking about all humans not humanoid right

1305
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,055
So at this point in the show Alice

1306
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Alex Goes to call

1307
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
And

1308
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
This is one of the more uncomfortable

1309
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
Tribble and unpleasant

1310
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,455
Set of calls

1311
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,503
Studies taking

1312
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
It's all Harris

1313
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
Austin Smith call again

1314
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
No

1315
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
At least

1316
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:42,207
At least I wouldn't be this like this is the price I think this could get people

1317
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
Oh that's

1318
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,047
Yeah Google talking about the vaccine stuff

1319
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
And I would say some bad medical advice

1320
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,167
Also just is acting weird with these people

1321
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
I just one caller

1322
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,775
He calls in and what he's talking about how his dad got the vaccine

1323
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
And then died

1324
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
Announces response

1325
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Is a little weird

1326
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
In-N-Out

1327
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,991
And and

1328
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
In adults

1329
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,415
God Almighty Ralph who do you blame

1330
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,975
You know all these famous

1331
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,303
Stars that died today

1332
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
They said I want to protect

1333
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,631
People were tough guy

1334
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
They did it because they were lied to they were actually Heroes your dad

1335
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,775
I believe meant well and was a hero at the end of the day

1336
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
What about the

1337
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Brother

1338
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Bill Gates and the globalist

1339
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
I would love to meet Bill Gates

1340
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
So weird

1341
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,855
The weird response to have when someone's telling you this story about their dad passing away fairly recently

1342
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
You to ask

1343
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
Who do you blame we have a

1344
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Come

1345
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
Literally

1346
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:52,095
Very very old term for is this thing that he is

1347
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,935
Asking the man to do and we see it in a bad

1348
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
Contacts what's up

1349
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:02,847
It's called a scapegoat dad who do you blame it's not a good question ever

1350
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
No it's

1351
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,151
It's definitely not it's a

1352
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
It's rude to

1353
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,503
I don't think that color took it is rude but

1354
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,855
It's it is who do you want me to kill is this that is another answer for

1355
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,207
Your dad was murdered who do you blame the thing is like

1356
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Bizarre

1357
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:26,911
Real conversation that you want to have them public value

1358
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Exactly what Alex

1359
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,311
Because this is an intensely painful story if it's true I'm not sure if

1360
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,103
It's just calling it.

1361
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,175
That's f****** super hard

1362
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Dude lost his dad

1363
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,527
Recently

1364
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,551
Really hard

1365
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,599
The function of Alex's show is to take

1366
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,903
Feelings like the one this caller is experiencing

1367
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,719
Translate them into feelings of anger and Hate

1368
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,279
Direct me to the people Alex has decided are his enemy

1369
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Now

1370
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,375
He's talking specifically about Bill Gates

1371
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,935
And what have you put

1372
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Make no mistake

1373
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,263
This exact sort of

1374
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
Transmutation of

1375
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:11,455
Hanging into hate and anger that is exactly what happens towards the marginalized communities

1376
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,479
That Alex

1377
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,015
Attacks demonizes

1378
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
It's exactly the same but that's

1379
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
A switch

1380
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
It is which s***

1381
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,671
Blame the witch's Golf Course

1382
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:26,815
It's the witches it stop raining do blame the way I know that's God the demons Make It Rain and God makes

1383
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,607
Duh

1384
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Gay people

1385
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
Alex gets another call

1386
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,775
And this guy was saying that his dad got a shot

1387
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
And then

1388
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
Maybe have

1389
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Some indication

1390
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
He might have

1391
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Prostate

1392
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,735
Here is how this goes

1393
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
So my dad is a

1394
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
He had the second

1395
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,879
Vaccine

1396
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
And now he just

1397
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Receiver that his

1398
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
PSA levels

1399
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
Greater Highway

1400
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
Original August

1401
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,583
Station House

1402
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
Do cancers

1403
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,287
Actually said that Surly said when you said he took the Pfizer or moderna

1404
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,687
Pfizer but I'm not 100% sure on that

1405
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
Pre-cancerous

1406
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,015
Oligo cancerous

1407
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,063
Oh wow so

1408
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Now they want to biopsy of the prostate

1409
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,415
Can you show them the literature saying

1410
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,767
But it makes a hormone-based tissues swell up and that they should not

1411
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
Autobiographies for 6 months

1412
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
I guess I was not aware of that

1413
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Videos

1414
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Be alarmed

1415
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,615
After mRNA vaccine

1416
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
If your glands

1417
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
Uterus prostate

1418
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,967
A swell up

1419
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Okay

1420
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:56,671
Whether or not covid-19 vaccine causes a side effect of gland swelling this is so irresponsible

1421
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Possible of Alex

1422
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:02,047
If it's callers dad who was a doctor has reason to suspect he may have prostate cancer

1423
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,839
He needs to take appropriate steps

1424
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
To make sure

1425
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
One way or another because

1426
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
Akita treatment is early detection

1427
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:13,311
Oz advice for him to avoid getting a biopsy and just assume it's probably a side effect of the vaccine

1428
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,895
Even though the caller can't even remember which vaccine is Dad got

1429
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
Making people hurt

1430
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,271
Alex is misrepresenting a recent article from the Cleveland Clinic

1431
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Titled

1432
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:28,415
Don't be alarmed by this covid-19 vaccine side effect that could be confused with breast cancer

1433
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,255
This deals with possible swelling of the lymph nodes under your arm

1434
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
As a side effect

1435
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,559
To the covid-19 vaccine

1436
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Which is relevant

1437
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
Because that's also assigned a breast

1438
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,935
Does nothing to do with prostate swelling

1439
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:44,799
Immediately taken off air for offering this Reckless medical advice to

1440
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,567
Do his audio

1441
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Please call her

1442
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
Do we clear this caller is probably going to be fine

1443
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,943
Is that teams not believe this b*******

1444
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,271
Diesel doctor so I would imagine he's taking appropriate actions

1445
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
To protect his own health

1446
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,671
My son sent me YouTube videos and I'm a doctor to get a biopsy

1447
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
The problem is with listeners who

1448
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
Hear this and pick out two nozani

1449
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,607
What if one of them has a possible cancer symptom that they decide to overlook

1450
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
Because Alex told them

1451
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,911
It's just a vaccine side of

1452
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,983
Legitimately that has the potential to get people hurt

1453
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
Or to give

1454
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
If you have

1455
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
God forbid

1456
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
Some kind of

1457
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,943
Swelling or some kind of a symptom of cancer outside of

1458
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,479
I mean even if it is Belen

1459
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271
Nodes in your armies probably

1460
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,063
Make sure and go talk to a doctor

1461
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,207
You shouldn't get a biopsy for 6 months

1462
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Critical

1463
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,047
Yeah I'm dumb

1464
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,887
This is one of the instances with me being like very much

1465
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
There should be a

1466
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,519
If there's a consequence for telling people to drink bleach

1467
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,079
There should be a consequence for telling people not

1468
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Got to get

1469
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
Medical tree

1470
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Or not to

1471
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Do what ya

1472
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
That's

1473
01:13:55,967 --> 01:14:00,575
It's outrageous that is it is just as bad to say like

1474
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
Hey here's a

1475
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,903
Cure for your problem as it is to say

1476
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
Don't

1477
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,743
Seek out medical attention because what you

1478
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
You should listen to me

1479
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,839
Yeah you're fine exactly

1480
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
F***** them

1481
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,935
So this next caller

1482
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
If this person actually kind of tickled me

1483
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,263
With her with her voice

1484
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Enjoy this guy's voice

1485
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
Hey Alex

1486
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,687
Man I'm just watching the hot the new Holocaust brother

1487
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
Iron Man

1488
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Not that depressed me

1489
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:40,511
Oh boy I like him calling a man over and over

1490
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,351
Yeah yeah

1491
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
Listening something with sex now that's

1492
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,679
Not good you can't understand

1493
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Damn

1494
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
Things that sick

1495
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,543
Kind of topics that Alex is covering you have

1496
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
No ability

1497
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,151
Totally to tugade r222 measure

1498
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,687
Holyshit

1499
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,783
At a time whenever everyone is telling you that your dreams are not real

1500
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,111
You are listening to a man tell you about how his dreams are real

1501
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,207
And that's how you get political awareness at

1502
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,743
Definitely not good

1503
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Subway

1504
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,535
Yeah I mean what is

1505
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
6 like

1506
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Second grade

1507
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
What is that

1508
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
I think

1509
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Yeah that's not

1510
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
I remember

1511
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,127
Finish my work early so I can play with Dinosaurs

1512
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,455
And I remember nobody telling me that

1513
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,039
Dinosaurs were actually put there by wait no I disagree

1514
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,599
I was told that dinosaurs were put there

1515
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
By God

1516
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
To test our faith

1517
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
When I was 60

1518
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,999
Well that didn't have any negative effects on me dad

1519
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
6

1520
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,351
First year that I lived in Hawaii like

1521
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
I was

1522
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,655
First grade

1523
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Holy child look

1524
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,959
I think back on like

1525
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
I didn't know anything

1526
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
Listening to Alex from fat

1527
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,895
I am going to

1528
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,223
I'm going to listen to Alex while I work on my multiplication

1529
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Tables real quick

1530
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,527
So

1531
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,319
Okay so three times

1532
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
4 + 12 +

1533
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:15,487
12 is the number of the Illuminati trying to kill me this is meaning

1534
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,303
The teacher might be the devil

1535
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
Yeah I think it'll be tough

1536
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,911
2

1537
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
Live that way

1538
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,983
I mean like I would come home from

1539
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,775
From school and I would do homework

1540
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,799
Sometimes watching

1541
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
Tarl

1542
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:38,527
Also it seems positively cheerful cheerful for someone who is absorbed

1543
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
Bulshit

1544
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:45,439
I want to hear about what happened in his life recently you'll be even more surprised that he's that chipper

1545
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
I don't know man

1546
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,119
I lost my wife last year

1547
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,655
I couldn't really get her

1548
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
For medical attention

1549
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,543
And she had real baddie

1550
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
COPD

1551
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,639
Cheap she would you would not go to the hop

1552
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431
They wouldn't let me stay

1553
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:12,575
She wouldn't she would not stay

1554
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,415
That's right and I know you and I wasn't going to let her stay without me because I knew

1555
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
If I got her in there

1556
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
With her condition she was

1557
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
Be done for

1558
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,351
PCR test an innovator for the money

1559
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
Yeah I know it

1560
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,679
And I saw any anyway

1561
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Said it home till she

1562
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
Died

1563
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Jesus

1564
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
I mean that's

1565
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
So sad

1566
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Set the person who

1567
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,223
Alex killed his wife

1568
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,063
I mean not individually but like that information sphere

1569
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,623
How's like insisting that they're going to

1570
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,183
Kill you for the covid money

1571
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Made it so she didn't get a

1572
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
Appropriate care in

1573
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Sat at home and died

1574
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
If true

1575
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,399
Again this is just calling about the shop

1576
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,727
Calling and complimenting the guy

1577
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Who is

1578
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
Been listening to

1579
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
Since he was six

1580
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,335
Yeah

1581
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,383
Got it deep into his head that

1582
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
You can't

1583
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
Let your wife go with that

1584
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:15,039
While this episode as a body count this is a this is a body

1585
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
It really is

1586
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,903
Hypothetical future and which self

1587
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
Locked up

1588
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Does he like

1589
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
That's how

1590
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,535
F***** up your brain gets

1591
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,327
I would rather

1592
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,143
Blame I would rather lose my wife

1593
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,447
I would rather lose my wife

1594
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,775
And still believe that I am

1595
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Following the correct path

1596
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
Then I would

1597
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
Confront reality and save my wife's life

1598
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
Roar

1599
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
Whatever

1600
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
You know improve her life

1601
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,599
Serially I mainly alternative

1602
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,367
Was

1603
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,671
Think you had this paranoid delusion

1604
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,207
And about this conspiracy that she's gone

1605
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,743
Dive to go to the hospital

1606
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,279
Yeah well she did die

1607
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
Like not going

1608
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,327
To the hospital

1609
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
I don't understand how this is a win

1610
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
It's not

1611
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
It's no f******

1612
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,703
Ringside

1613
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
That is just so funny

1614
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,823
And it's so awful when these like humans

1615
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,103
Stories if true

1616
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:16,223
Penetrate through Alex's show and they are taken as seriously as they really are like that

1617
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,015
Family messed up

1618
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,087
And you have this and it's like okay these are glimpses into

1619
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,135
Some of these people's lives who have been

1620
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
Affected by Alex

1621
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,207
The contact presumably since they were sick

1622
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
Yeah huh

1623
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
Yeah

1624
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,119
At the same time the show the day prior

1625
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:37,727
Was a complete freak out of him just being emotionally unhinged

1626
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:42,079
Yelling about 2 how you needs to quit cuz the staff won't get his video out on time

1627
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,895
And how he has Nightmares of the devil eating his Unborn

1628
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Like its

1629
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,759
That's the same person

1630
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,319
Who is being looked at as an expert 5

1631
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,111
This guy who

1632
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
What does wife died at home

1633
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Empathetically

1634
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
A quieter

1635
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,535
And then

1636
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:06,399
Continuing to yell as if as if you weren't listening to somebody tell you

1637
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:11,775
Hey you're responsible for my wife's well and what you're going to get is that sort of pay sorry about that

1638
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,384
You're also going to get a doubling down and a reinforcing Anna validating

1639
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
Of the exact

1640
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
Mercy nonsense that led you

1641
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
And your wife

1642
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
Tenada getting appropriate care it's

1643
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
Verify this is straight up

1644
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Real

1645
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,392
Cult leadership

1646
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,184
This is 100%

1647
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,976
Hey your wife died

1648
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
And

1649
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,280
Because of everybody but

1650
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,304
The cult leader

1651
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,168
That's just so f*** she would have lived if they wouldn't have killed her at the hospital

1652
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,520
Okay you know what happened in my cult

1653
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,848
The cult leader was responsible for the death of a child

1654
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Yeah

1655
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
As was his parents

1656
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,456
And everything that they believed in

1657
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,504
And whenever that child died

1658
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
I do to their lack of

1659
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
Care

1660
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,832
Their denial of care

1661
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,624
And their belief that

1662
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,184
Caring for the child at a hospital or even can

1663
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,208
Considering

1664
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Medicine

1665
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
Would be

1666
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,560
Arrests in

1667
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
That guy went to

1668
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
Jail

1669
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
Everybody has the right

1670
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,192
2

1671
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,752
Accept or refuse Medical Care

1672
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,056
Answer like I'm not

1673
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,640
That's going to do that and I can play that game

1674
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,200
When you are responding

1675
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,248
2 misinformation or called leadership

1676
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,576
And that is what is motivating you

1677
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,368
It's a completely different

1678
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
Now that is

1679
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
Is that is a

1680
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
Yep

1681
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
Question in my mind

1682
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
I feel like

1683
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
When I

1684
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,656
This is the complicated like difficult Pusha

1685
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
Tympole evolve list

1686
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
Coming to the show

1687
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
It's like

1688
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,032
I kind of feel bad about myself

1689
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
Is all last

1690
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:55,968
That what's clearly a guy freaking out I'm having an emotionally unbalanced day on the 7th

1691
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,760
Don't feel bad

1692
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,296
And then I'll get to this and I'll be like

1693
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,320
I don't feel bad

1694
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
How can how can he

1695
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:06,208
How can you deserve any consideration

1696
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
None

1697
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,024
It's just a

1698
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Difficult

1699
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
How to preserve your Humanity when face

1700
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
With

1701
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
Such inhuman

1702
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Like just

1703
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
True

1704
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
Psychopathy

1705
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,824
I just I'm such a narcissist

1706
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
That I can

1707
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
Hear this story

1708
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,944
That I bear responsibility

1709
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
At least partially

1710
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,016
For the death of this man's wife

1711
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,832
And I'm just going to tell him that he was so great

1712
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648
I know I have a strong scent

1713
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
The Alex

1714
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Would not have

1715
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,536
Kept his wife at home in a hospital

1716
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,584
Very expensive

1717
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
Yeah no it's

1718
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
It's so it's

1719
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
Just such what you see and I know

1720
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
You want to provide empathy

1721
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
For this because you are a hue

1722
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
Human being

1723
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:55,104
And you can't allow yourself to let empathy

1724
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,896
The diet challenges me

1725
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
It's tough but when you get pass

1726
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
After certain point

1727
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,504
It's just like

1728
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
F*** you

1729
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
It's Harbor good

1730
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
Forever

1731
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
Let's get that good

1732
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
Forever

1733
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
Let's put that behind us

1734
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
Listen to Alex

1735
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,280
This is not tell you belong to the city

1736
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,840
Is Alex

1737
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
Bumper Music

1738
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,424
And rambling about nonsense

1739
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,216
Just a sort of

1740
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,776
Cleanse our pilot on the way out of this episode

1741
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,592
This is a little

1742
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
Track night

1743
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,640
From me

1744
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,456
Tron Legacy soundtrack

1745
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:37,856
Big Red

1746
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
A digital Frontier I tried to picture of information

1747
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:50,656
What do they look like

1748
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:57,056
Motorcycles windshield Apartment B

1749
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:03,456
Home Alone

1750
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:09,856
I got in

1751
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:16,256
WorldMark interspatial attack

1752
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:22,656
Are those all Solaris in the song God's plan

1753
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,240
One day I got it

1754
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,640
Coming from that perspective it all makes sense

1755
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:39,040
Fold-up finally respect you

1756
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
We chose the winter

1757
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,584
You're going to lose

1758
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
We both laugh

1759
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,400
I left

1760
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,240
Significantly I would argue that I did not just laugh

1761
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
For it buddy

1762
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:04,640
Yeah I guess they're the enemy respect to 12

1763
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:10,272
I really don't think they do those three imaginary King globalist that have the same understanding of

1764
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,064
The plan is Alexandra got a lot of

1765
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
Now that's

1766
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,368
That's probably true

1767
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,000
That sounds right like that like you know like Achilles and Hector eventually

1768
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
How to respect

1769
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,328
For each other although I believe that was after Hector was dead

1770
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
You know

1771
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,168
It's just like

1772
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,496
Ezra Levant comes on

1773
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,056
The show at towards the end of this episode

1774
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:39,456
And these are complaining that the u.s. Navy hired researchers at the University of Arkansas to spy on him and his website

1775
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,016
And then somehow somebody sold that report to just

1776
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
Trudeau

1777
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:48,672
I can't find sorry what I don't know okay I can't find any evidence of this other than an article on rebel mean

1778
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,720
Weather report is referred to as

1779
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,048
Canada election cyber-forensics analysis the date

1780
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
October 10th

1781
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
2019

1782
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,448
The X-ray report isn't linked there and I have no idea if it's real so I was trying to

1783
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
And I googled it

1784
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
I guess what the first thing

1785
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,312
Comes up if you Google those words is

1786
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
Bulshit

1787
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,896
Is a page where Rebel media is doing a donor Drive

1788
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,968
I've called cyber intelligence operation donation

1789
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
Using his alleged reported

1790
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
The bait on the hook of a pledge Drive

1791
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:21,952
I'd like to CBC we don't get a billion dollars a year so if you can chip in to help cover our costs and fight back against the law

1792
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
Live

1793
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,488
Appreciate it

1794
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
I don't know if this is real or not

1795
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,816
Ezra Levant is a bigot

1796
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
The career liar somebody

1797
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm seriously until he produces the report

1798
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah I don't

1799
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,960
WellCare

1800
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,496
But he does say something kind of funny

1801
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,288
What you know what

1802
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,592
Where is the ACLU

1803
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,664
If it was The Young Turks or Jim Acosta

1804
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,968
MSNBC

1805
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,784
Or even Eleanor B of the leftist on

1806
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,320
The View who were spied on

1807
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
It would be

1808
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,672
Lose your Canadian way if it were Ellen

1809
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,072
It's vatche ACLU

1810
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Dan

1811
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
Where is the ACLU

1812
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
I mean that

1813
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
Seriously

1814
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,312
Is there a physical location for the ACLU

1815
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,360
He was asking an honest question

1816
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
I don't I don't know how I don't know if the ACLU does work with people who aren't protected by American civil liberties

1817
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,040
The First Amendment right

1818
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Where are you

1819
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,160
The ACLU isn't in Canada

1820
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:29,792
That's funny

1821
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
If Ellen was

1822
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
Spider Bond

1823
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:36,448
Her get elected committed as bright candidates prime minister

1824
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,728
HEB

1825
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,616
Probably a coincidence that right now as relevant as in the middle of a defamation trial

1826
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,944
For saying that somebody was involved in a terrorist

1827
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,736
Attack they weren't involved in

1828
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,576
I'm at Alex's interview yeah it doesn't come up

1829
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,624
Seems like that would be the first thing I would want to talk

1830
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,672
Front of that thing

1831
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,696
Nope

1832
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Does not huh

1833
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,536
Yeah I think it's worth $200,000

1834
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,816
I think that's the way

1835
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,864
A couple new donors

1836
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,400
He's going to need a lot of new donors

1837
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,960
Let's cease being sued

1838
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
According to chocks

1839
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056

Edmonton nightclub in 1993 when chocolate 19

1843
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:27,904
Talk was acquitted of the 1993 charges and what he called a case of mistaken identity

1844
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:33,792
If you mentally denied any involvement in the shooting saying he was at his parents house with friends and had absolutely no knowledge of what train

1845
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Inspired

1846
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
That legitimate

1847
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,288
News outlets

1848
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:50,688
Don't just print the first name they can fight I don't know I don't know how that's going to play out but I do think it's a little bit of

1849
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,992
Maybe an Alex Jones money bomb types

1850
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
Situation

1853
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:06,304
An immense amount

1854
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
Anyway

1855
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,984
This is this episode when a little bit of a bummer for me top t2b top-to-bottom hat

1856
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752

The freak out that got edited out of A League of Their Own show

1862
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,600
Try an outline one time

1863
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
Quite an amazing thing to see

1864
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,696
Because there's a point when Alex says s***

1865
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,512
And I was like I got to go find the

1866
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,816

01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:45,216
It's gone

1868
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,008
They cut that whole thing out

1869
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
And put the

1870
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,824
The Right video in

1871
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,432

I'm furious

1874
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,136
So depressing and the other thing is

1875
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
The guest

1876
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,928

1877
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,976

1883
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
Shut off

1884
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,592
I mean if they're going to bring something to the table that was interesting

1885
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Maybe but they did

1886
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
Damped

1887
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:32,832
