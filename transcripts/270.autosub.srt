00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:18,432
Greek Novelties even talk about Alex

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
I should tell you that this is an inch

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Interesting

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,856
Actual novelty novelty beverage

IPA

00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
A bunch of time

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Not novel well we've run out of different ipas at the liquor store and they don't have anything other than Bud Light after that

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
That's not

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
I can report

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Happily

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Terrible

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Yep this is garbage we're getting sponsor

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,600
Riddle of the day

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
Nice

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
Kickstart of hydration and watermelon

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Oh yeah

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Anyway I'm sorry

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
I was just going to ask you if you've ever lied about how much

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,400
Or inflated your self-worth

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Usher

23
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
I feel ashamed of made like

24
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
40000

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
That's it.

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
More

27
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
You know

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
You live 30 something years I bet there is a time I did

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,376
But I can't think what like maybe back when I get a paper route I might have lied and said it like

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
In order to have a paper

31
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
Something like that

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Nothing that's possible I don't know

33
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
People know me is this

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
Straight shooter.

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Self worth

36
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
But that was

37
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
Which is next to nothing about my self-worth but that's called keeping a stiff upper lip

38
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,712
Showing that old British resolve

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,064
A man one more bad thing and I'm out of his life

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
How are you

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Right

42
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
In order to get more money for

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
I think that's not called

44
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Yeah

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
Alex Jones

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,776

I don't want

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,583
Play Gerard Avenue Robert Ave

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,471

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm not sure

70
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
The button says sports show

71
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,039
Evaluation of monetary

Pittance

74
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Yeah

75
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,327
This is cool man we were raised well you know already

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
It's hard to avoid this sort of in

77
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Information break

78
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
What is deemed!

79
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,479
What's going to happen the moment there was a fight

80
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
That Rogan Woods

81
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,623
Because the other way with his humanity and be like I'm not going to reward this

82
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Yeah

83
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
I have a lot of thoughts and we'll get

84
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
On Wednesday Joe Rogan embarrassment parade

85
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Nicely done

86
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Really deeply embarrassing

87
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Like all across-the-board everyone comes out looking bad

88
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,039
Like Rogan looks like he is an enabling f*** head

89
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,135
If you don't come away from it thinking like

90
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Alex Jones is ADP

91
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Believe Disturbed human being

92
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
He is really really f***** up

93
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
And he is dealing with some intent

94
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Internal emotional

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
Mental health type issues

96
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
I don't know how you're dealing with reality

97
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Like right you can you can be intrigued by his

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Conspiracies and Pinky

99
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
He's funny and all this stuff you can do that all day long

100
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
But if you're paying attention to you listen to the things he's saying

101
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
He's describing a deeply

102
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Play Disturbed

103
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Thought pattern

104
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
A deeply Disturbed human

105
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
It's so f***** up

106
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,279
And Joe is just

107
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
F****** help

108
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Please

109
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Yeah because some of the times I think

110
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
He thinks that Alex's

111
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Is joking when he

112
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
It does not have

113
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,287
And then what

114
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Hi

115
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,223
Are there smoking some tobacco and Studio Alex let me have some of that

116
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Tobacco

117
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
As if it's not a f****** video podcast

118
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
He's very I don't know how much that I don't know how much

119
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Just trying to be cute I'm not going to

120
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
I'm not going to judge

121
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
I tried to make some

122
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
Like little beginning note

123
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
I wanted to talk about before we got into

124
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Just to give

125
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Some of my bra.

126
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
What this I think we touched on them already.

127
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Embarrassing

128
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
But it's a smart move

129
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Go to because he knows

130
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Both of them know that

131
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
It's going to work out well for them

132
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Like

133
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Clix and stuff like that

134
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
They both win in the end

135
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
The conclusion of the

136
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Joe Rogan Alex Jones

137
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Pissed off

138
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,143
There's a large part of me even covering this is kind of a bad idea

139
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
Pointless exercise

140
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,335
But at the same time I don't see how we're in Alex Jones podcast and we somehow get away with

141
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Not covered

142
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:49,503
You know what I'm saying covering like a modern-day thing which I intended to do for this episode

143
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
To do this at the podcast

144
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
Feel like this is a modern-day thing

145
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
So here you go

146
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Here's Where We Are

147
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
It's entirely possible that Alex and Joe's fight was entirely

148
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
But if I had to guess from watching this and seeing the way that

149
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
The two of them behaved in the

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,751
I would say that it was fake from Alex's side and sincere from

151
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,591
I think Joe was scared for a friend who is lashing out at him

152
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
In an attempt to get attention

153
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
I need dealt with it exactly the wrong way

154
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
By caving in and giving him the attention

155
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
He was demanding

156
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
Alex literally threatened to politically murder Joe on air

157
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
The accused

158
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
Just having mob connections that were

159
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
All of his running

160
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Bitcoin scams

161
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,655
Fun in bed with Jack

162
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Sure the accused

163
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Covering up satanic pedophile ring

164
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
Talked about aspects of Jose personal life

165
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
He was clearly told to

166
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Keep private

167
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
And all of that

168
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
Incredibly inappropriate

169
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Abusive Behavior

170
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Was not

171
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Only not

172
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
It was rewarded

173
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
Go to be really hard to imagine a scenario in the future where Alex does

174
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Throwing a tantrum

175
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
Is the right way for him to get exactly what he wants

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
I don't know

177
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,703
On this episode Alex Begins the show with a glass of straight Tito's vodka in hand

178
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
Any get pretty drunk pretty early

179
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,895
Meat meat meat on ice

180
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
It's just still straight vodka

181
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Proud of it

182
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
The only thing I'm surprised by In This podcast is that Alex was drinking clear liquor

183
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
You like weird start with

184
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
I'm not I'm not mad at you

185
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Like I understand

186
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
To get a buzz

187
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
Inch it like that but at the same time

188
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,271
You're going to end up talking about satanic pedophiles and screaming about aliens

189
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Stuff like that

190
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Seriously don't be drunk at new

191
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Well that's why

192
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,695
Start with the clear liquor at right around 45

193
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
You can switch to the brown like you got a f******

194
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Handle

195
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Huge bottle of Tito's

196
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,055
He makes pretty good progress

197
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
So they proceeded to record for 5 hours

198
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
And as you can expect

199
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,295
There was a lot that pretty much impossible for us to cover it all in one episode

200
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Without it becoming as long as our goddamn endgame

201
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
That is to say that they're probably points of the show that listeners will think we miss

202
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
And to that I say

203
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Fair enough

204
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
I tried to prioritize looking at things

205
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Disgusted

206
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Providing new information

207
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
Caveat that I don't necessarily believe most of the stuff I was going to say

208
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
It's hours and hours of a drunk

209
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Idiot talking

210
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
Pretty much

211
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,783
The Infowars two-stroke

212
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,391
Branded but in the same way

213
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
And you talked about narratives

214
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Recovered 100 times I don't see a real

215
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Benefit

216
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
Can covering it again

217
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
The talking about this like why we talked about that

218
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,983
Breathing stuff that he said the last time he was on Rogan show

219
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
And some people like like

220
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
You talk about that

221
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
I promise you

222
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
If we didn't talk about it

223
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
There's a

224
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
5% chance that I missed it

225
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
And there's a 90% chance

226
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
That I just thought like

227
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Another 5%

228
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Wildcard

229
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
Wild Card explanation

230
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Here's what's really important to keep in mind

231
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
All this exists only for Alex get publicity that he

232
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
He does not have access to any more on his own

233
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
Alex has a major problem on his hands

234
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
To attract people into his financial web

235
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
And Joe is one of the only solution

236
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
That he has left his problem

237
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,551
If he reaches a point where you can't manipulate new people into his little Marketplace

238
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Then it's game over

239
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
It's just a waiting game to see how long

240
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
You can delay the audience

241
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
But he has her leaving him

242
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
That's all this episode is about

243
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Alex is trying to sell himself to Jose audience

244
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
Do an extensive almost incidental to Alex

245
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Except to be a prop

246
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Someone whose mind you can blow

247
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
I would put it like this

248
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Alex's be Cutco knife salesman

249
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
And Joe is the penny that

250
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Tickets cut-through to demonstrate how good his knives

251
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
But yeah that's kind of how I

252
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Fuel when I listen to

253
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Episode

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Almost

255
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Like

256
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Joe is trying to deal with it

257
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Human standpoint of like

258
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
You're my friend I think you're

259
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,767
We just didn't talk enough and that's why you got mad at me

260
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Trying to reach

261
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,471
A now that I say and Alex's bear to pay lip service to that

262
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
Talk about

263
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Your leaders are really going on in the world

264
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Because he wants Jose audio

265
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
You willing to tell realize that Alex isn't actually

266
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
I don't think you like

267
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
Alex was screaming on aired

268
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Not a couple

269
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Weeks ago

270
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,767
On his own show about how my big mistake was I I just

271
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Became your friend

272
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
I never liked you I didn't like you

273
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
From Joe

274
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
The same time when you say s*** like that

275
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
I don't know

276
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
They don't have

277
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
Cuz they don't have as deep a relationship

278
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Edgewood

279
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
Deserve that kind of patience and that kind of chance

280
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Right like you

281
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
Whenever they talk about any of their

282
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
They're like a story that's not good

283
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Every single time they talked about like

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Oh remember the good times

285
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,935
It's at one time they ran around and George Bush map

286
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Re-read

287
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,615
That's the only f****** story that they ever bring up of like aren't we great friends

288
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:13,247
The time wasn't that the brothers I think that's why they became so close

289
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
You can never break

290
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
I don't disagree

291
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
So

292
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Here we go we're going to jump in and of course

293
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
One of the big sticking points

294
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
It's for Joe not wanting to have Alex back on his show

295
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Headband that he realized

296
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,751
About what he said about Sandy Hook

297
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Alex

298
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Gave Joe the line to like

299
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,895
We just have to pay both

300
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,711
Aunt Jo on his own show and past episodes

301
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Has made the point that

302
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
One of the things that I had a problem with

303
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Is that I heard the clip

304
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,183
I went back and I listen to stuff and I saw that Alex was lying to me about the

305
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
I'm so

306
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Right at the beginning of the show they

307
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
They start

308
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Their fight

309
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
A little bit and then get into after this clip

310
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
The immediate elephant-in-the-room

311
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
That is Alex lied about

312
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Alex Jones

313
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
We're live

314
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,527
Go to be here man good to see you

315
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Why are things are happening

316
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,463
You and I

317
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Padua Fresno get a long conversation on the phone

318
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,887
Which led to just a lot of talk to drop today

319
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
Cast

320
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,823
We cleared the air on the phone we decide to clear the air Moana podcast

321
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
No more relationship

322
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,551
We talked about 90 minutes about how you threatened to murder me on your show and then

323
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
Essentially made criminal accusations against me and

324
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
Talk about my family in ways that

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
I made it clear is not for public discussion

326
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
You betrayed my confidence on air

327
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:09,215
I'm sorry

328
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
It was Alex

329
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
Yeah well is Austin

330
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
Right

331
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
But being a sad sack

332
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
And Rogan being like well maybe my friend really is in pain

333
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Performatively Express

334
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Disease

335
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
These emotions that humans

336
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
How we got to where we are now that's

337
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,127
Read the first part

338
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
You know what his XM was out why not just talked to Alex Jones

339
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
You already from the first from the jump

340
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
They are not

341
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
On the same page

342
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
At all until about 2 hours in

343
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,143
And when the when the

344
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Not good

345
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Variable

346
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
I'm so here we go this is

347
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Point at which

348
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
Rogan brings up Sandy Hook

349
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
And a scallop

350
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Makerspace

351
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Clarify

352
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
The thing that people are upset about you the things we want to talk about like quick to get it over with or not. Quick

353
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
But just get it

354
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Is the Sandy Hooks gas

355
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Yeah

356
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
So

357
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Your take on it

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
First off

359
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,991
Because it's always misrepresented herself

360
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
I love Gwinnett

361
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm about to lie to you I always expect the next sentence to be

362
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,255
F*** you b**** in The Clique

363
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,887
I'm up

364
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,567
First things first makes me think of Chocolate Starfish

365
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
Different reference

366
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Okay okay

367
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Real tragedies

368
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
And I believe

369
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Cool

370
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
And you believe Sandy Hook app

371
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,687
You are

372
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Video editing timeline

373
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,599
Almost

374
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,751
We already know just from looking at the days after Sandy Hook on our own show that that's

375
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Complete lie

376
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
I know how does Joe not know that he's I don't know I'm clear the air and it's

377
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Explain like

378
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
What are the things that you know like what

379
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
What why is it okay what you're saying

380
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:42,719
That sort of thing

381
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:49,119
Just sort of refine his life

382
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Static-X

383
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
Lake listeners are people on

384
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
The internet or whatever were things that he was

385
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Responding to

386
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Sure I'm willing to buy that

387
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
I mean you should have a better editorial policy

388
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
In terms

389
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
What you report on

390
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Number one

391
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
I didn't number to the timeline week later

392
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,975
And then five days later on September 19th

393
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
It was fake the day off right

394
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
He came to a solid position a couple days after December 19th 2012

395
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
He started suggesting that they were actors

396
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
You cannot

397
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
Make this claim here

398
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
This is b*******

399
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
And Joel allows it to go on question

400
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Which is a very serious problem just out of

401
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
I think I like them are going to work themselves up

402
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Open to like

403
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,903
Possibly a new lawsuit by the time

404
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
This is over

405
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Over this

406
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,031
One sentence I really think could be acting

407
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
In a bowl like in addition

408
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Like

409
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:09,759
Getting Alex

410
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
To continue to dig his own grave

411
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,623
I don't think so cuz this would be a much shorter episodes

412
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Knock that out the first few minutes

413
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
Alex that blows a timeline

414
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Again about that

415
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
Hook and we know that from looking back

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Just a monster Blaine.

417
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
Well I don't think that's I think the majority of them are angry because the narrative has been that you're sending people to the Sandy Hook

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Families hope

420
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
Home

421
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Lateral

422
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
Yes there is video.

423
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,184
Put together

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you think it's not real

425
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,352
But now you do think it's real or not

426
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
Because your job

427
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
You're f****** bad at this

428
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
Like

429
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
Yeah I just got the police.

430
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
And I really hurt people

431
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,736
Responsibility

432
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Go to the

433
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Adult entire episode

434
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,160
The video that is not at all

435
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,976
He's telling a least that the 2015

436
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
Yeah absolutely not

437
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
He's dodging responsibility while trying to

438
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Again performatively except

439
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Responsibility

440
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,544
That's pathetic not only that but we did here in our days after

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Sandy Hook that people

442
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,896
Need to go investigate and hire private

443
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
Gators

444
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
People to their houses

445
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Well he just said that

446
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah that's a good point he already but you could fall back on the argument of like

447
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
IMac

448
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Professional

449
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
I'm at the FBI needs to be investigating this

450
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,824
Amateur gumshoes

451
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
To get out there and stock peep

452
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
I don't know why but I've got this

453
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
Joe Rogan

454
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
They're not

455
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Cut bait with

456
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
I need never learn

457
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,304
Joe Rogan never took my advice when I was his dad

458
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
We are all our ancestors

459
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,520
By default that we are all everybody's I don't know

460
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Joe tries to get Alex to understand

461
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
There is

462
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Long people particularly

463
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
You people going to have

464
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
Certain forms of mental illness

465
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
You speaking way too broadly

466
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
Introducing like schizophrenic love conspiracy theories

467
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
It's a little bit to General

468
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Is that there are people

469
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
In the world who believe that everything

470
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
And that you

471
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Get into

472
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
To that system

473
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,752
And Alex piggybacking on that

474
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
He was kind of

475
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
That way

476
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Before kind of

477
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Before right

478
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,272
There's a problem

479
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Urus pack

480
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
He realized he was falling into that trap

481
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
And he discusses Atmos nextplus

482
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Stupid

483
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,168
Call Tricia

484
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,056
Everything

485
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,488
Now the important thing about that is Alex only is

486
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
He realized

487
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
But he was in this pattern of believing everything is fake and that's

488
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
Because he became the victim of

489
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
Conspiracy theories

490
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Basically

491
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
Started treating him the way that they treated

492
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
The people that Alex it about

493
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,640
And he then was like oh my God this is awful

494
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Is he dealing with the fact that

495
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
He created the

496
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,016
Or encourage these tendencies in

497
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
He's just saying it as sort of an abstract people are like that

498
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
As opposed to like

499
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
My entire modus operandi my entire business model

500
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
He's encouraging this behavior in

501
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
People and then once it was

502
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
Directed it I realized this isn't good

503
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,424
But I didn't change my behaviors but I'm a 10.

504
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Yeah he's he's

505
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Not

506
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Good

507
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Person

508
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,944
Nope he doesn't have a very large vocabulary

509
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
I prefer a good Lionel

510
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
You know the number of words

511
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
That he uses weirdly

512
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
Yeah but you knows a lot of five-dollar words that he throws in

513
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:45,376
I were telling the story of people and white Vans showing up at Rio with guns

514
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
My reaction would not be

515
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
It was like

516
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Whoa

517
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
Unless you're Black Rob

518
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,896
Best Buy

519
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,760
I think you're getting a sense here that Alex's sort of

520
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
I like

521
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Lip service to the idea that he did things wrong

522
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Is dodging responsibility

523
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Leave stomach stat

524
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
More than that

525
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
You seems to be painting the pictures that he's the real victim

526
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
In the whole thing what

527
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,056
Of course he only became aware that his behavior

528
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Maybe a mild psychosis because

529
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
He became victimized by them

530
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Which is

531
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Drawing attention away from the real victim

532
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
Oh his rhetoric and his behavior but this next clip I thought was a little bit beyond the

533
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,168
Happened

534
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Question

535
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
Not

536
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Push-up pops

537
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Notion hooked

538
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,344
Fuller house

539
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,672
Houses

540
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Crazy people now

541
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
Please stop

542
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,056
This is the money

543
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
To do

544
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
People weren't still

545
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
They were disgusting

546
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,224
The lingering damage of him stay

547
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Consistently in the past

548
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
When it matter

549
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
That's what people were talking about

550
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,952
And no one was trying to bait him into staying these things they could take s*** out of context

551
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
The victim narrative for himself

552
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,376
About this Trump the the actual event

553
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,448
So pathetic

554
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Over and over and over again

555
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
I apologize for it and it's over right

556
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
Can you can you stop doing me

557
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,536
You don't get to argue that like

558
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
Vietnamese were fake

559
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
And that gets you off the hook

560
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,216
Because you were reporting them and screaming about how they were real

561
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
That is the problem

562
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
I understand that you were tricked

563
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
Believe me you're preaching to the choir I think you're an idiot

564
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
You fall for things all the time

565
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,880
It is not excusing

566
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
To be included in his

567
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Yeah yeah

568
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
I guess you could I got you know what really what I think he's trying to do is trying to build an argument that takes away in Thai

569
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
From his

570
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
Because I think a big part of defamation

571
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Comes down to

572
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
You intentionally Moline

573
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,432
We both get this little

574
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
Is wedge in there of like

575
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
I was misled by bad information I came from

576
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Your place

577
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
And you don't hate

578
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
What it what you going to do

579
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,232
Maybe maybe he's trying to get that legal standard.

580
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Right

581
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Him to do that when

582
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
You go back and you look at it that's not that does not accurately

583
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Describe how you

584
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
That is not

585
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,056
Okay so actually Joe's an accessory to what I would describe as almost obstruction

586
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
Justice

587
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,992
If that's something that exists within a civil case I'm not sure if

588
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Alex if he

589
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
He wishes he'd done something

590
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
Difference

591
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,256
That's not Alex doing that

592
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
But

593
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Something different

594
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
Didn't take my shower was as powerful as it was

595
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,064
I'd like to remind everybody that

596
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
In 2000

597
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,744
3 years before the Sandy Hooks up Alex was screaming about how his show change the world

598
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,216
F*** you

599
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
I believe

600
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Two days after

601
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
He's screaming about Jose had to help bring back gun culture and then went out to break scream in Warwick

602
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,064
Listen to the show to find out what

603
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
I interviewed a congressman

604
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
Big that doesn't match at all and I think it's a very

605
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Pathetic angle to take

606
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Meanwhile ice Scream 4

607
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,680
Years about how I'm the most influential show in the world

608
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
We are the leaders and Patriot Radio

609
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Freedom talk

610
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Is

611
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Tonight's another thing

612
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,712
One thing it's super important to consider about Alex's protest that he didn't know how big his show was

613
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Navigate no idea he was hurting people

614
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
Is affected in late January 2013

615
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
The father of a victim at Sandy Hook

616
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Alex

617
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
An email

618
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,816
Letting you been being harassed by conspiracy theorist already at that point so he told Alex quote

619
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
Haven't we had our share of pain and suffering

620
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
I used to enjoy listening to your shows

621
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
Now I feel your type of show

622
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,776
Created these hateful people and they need to be reeled in

623
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
You saying that in the reference

624
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
To the fact that you used to love listening to

625
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
Galaxy was a fan of his show and tell

626
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,016
It ruined his life that is such an unfortunate irony

627
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,648
So he sent Alex an email within like a month or so months after

628
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
These consequences

629
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
Starting to show up in his life and we're really

630
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Terrible

631
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
Reply

632
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
What is assistant

633
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
No doubt this was a real tragedy

634
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:48,800
Of course after that response until Alex continue to Peddle the idea.

635
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,408
He posted an article with the headline quote FBI's has no one died at Sandy Hook

636
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
Which was an intentional misrepresentation

637
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
The murder statistics

638
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
I think we had to do with

639
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Like where they were

640
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
The murders were classified

641
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Stuff like that

642
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
They are

643
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
We'll deal with it in more detail when it comes up

644
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
In our 2012 coverage in the email

645
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,776
It is a real tragedy parentheses

646
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,848
That the government stage and you are an actor

647
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,992
Different brackets

648
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,600
Is recently as 2015 he was telling collars that

649
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
It was all actors

650
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
Synthetic no one died there I thought that

651
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,488
Kids died there but after I looked at it I realized

652
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Rizal actor

653
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,912
Those actions came after a parent of a murdered child reached out to him and made him very aware of the damage

654
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:53,312
All these excuses to the affective like

655
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Full and complete

656
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Wheatley deaf ears

657
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
One of the victims who was affected by his behavior

658
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Had made it clear to her

659
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,040
That this is something that is

660
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
A problem

661
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
You didn't care

662
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
I think we have intent

663
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
Yeah no totally care at all

664
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
He was aware

665
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
All this is bulshit

666
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
And Joe is allowing him

667
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Unquestioningly

668
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
To put this 4th

669
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Bulshit

670
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Bulshit

671
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
So

672
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
They appoint they start talking about how like

673
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
They had a little conversation

674
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Pre-show

675
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
And that Alex

676
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
Okay

677
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
So

678
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
This is just kind of funny because it

679
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Indicates how rude Alex

680
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
I don't know

681
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
Being processed

682
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Because I've experienced

683
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,688
What other people have said

684
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,528
Don't believe it was okay

685
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,136
More excuses more nonsense

686
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
I have a lot of

687
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
Okay

688
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,632
You're probably even in the beginning of that clip expressed exactly what

689
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Golden

690
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,288
You were letting me get my message out on your show we had callers matters

691
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Before the show

692
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
About what I can help

693
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
You spread

694
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
Plies I can help you get out and leave

695
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
You f****** either

696
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
The only debate

697
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,600
It's relevant and I don't really have a position on is how much

698
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,184
Joe is aware of the fact that he's being again

699
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,488
Yeah

700
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
Unknowing participant

701
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
In allowing Alex to

702
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
Lie to everybody

703
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
More

704
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
I don't know that's a debatable open question

705
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Who knows

706
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Joe

707
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
O.j.

708
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,664
I think we got a pretty clear picture that

709
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,224
I was just trying to equivocate Dodge responsibility

710
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,832
In some ways

711
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
Flying

712
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Even still

713
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
About the divided

714
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
All that stuff this is just

715
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,096
This is a disgrace people really got to learn how to apologize

716
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
That's when there's like a

717
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
That's a bad motor works for most people who don't know any better

718
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
You know what that

719
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,504
That's real big dump something differently

720
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,600
That takes a big man to say that it does not take a big man

721
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,952
It does not service of

722
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,792
Promoting a further life that would be so infuriating

723
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,936
Regardless of whether or not he's even telling the truth even if he was telling the truth

724
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
He is not saying

725
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
I am not making excuses for my behavior I'm giving you

726
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Explaining

727
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Response

728
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Possibility for what I've done

729
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
I'm fully taking responsibility for what

730
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Been done to the Sandy Hook

731
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
There's no ownership

732
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Nope

733
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
F****** pathetic

734
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,792
Find out where things

735
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Went wrong

736
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
The present troubles

737
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Birth

738
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
Bertram

739
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Yeah

740
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Yeah that was part of it

741
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
I think that was definitely

742
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Ratchet

743
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528
Now what

744
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,328
Junior

745
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
Okay so nice out at Don Jr is talking

746
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
That's cool man

747
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
True anymore

748
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Maybe don Jr gave him in

749
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Information

750
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
Positive

751
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
The point

752
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
They're not in can

753
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,328
No that's what I'm referencing

754
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
That was switched

755
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,008
I don't like I don't like any of that

756
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,336
It's a long line of incredibly stupid people

757
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
Enough

758
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Daisy chain game with Ella

759
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,944
Game of broken telephone

760
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
Complaining about the Chinese

761
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,952
At this point he's Google working

762
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
Together

763
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
That's not a good call

764
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
Joe Knows some people at Google

765
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
And it's spoken to them

766
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,704
And he's in a hot tub

767
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,920
Dumb f****** stories about running into globalists airports in Hot Springs

768
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
China Inn

769
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
That they are

770
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,880
And in a way that we would probably

771
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
Not be comfortable with

772
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,512
And actually Joe is even like I don't know if I think this is a good idea but here's the exit

773
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Reason for why they're doing

774
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:42,240
I knew someone who worked at Google I know someone who used to work at Google I should say

775
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Death thought process was

776
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,152
That Google is going to bring Google to China in the center form

777
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
They're going to copy Google

778
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
This is the real the real worry

779
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Because China copies everything

780
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,624
Intellectual

781
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
True but if this is what they're saying

782
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:10,144
As a business and I'm not saying I agree with this cuz I don't

783
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
Get some apple juice new system

784
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
Cheetos

785
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,872
Third glass of Tito's

786
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,736
Completely unwilling to hear

787
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
From

788
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,088
Yo it's from experience

789
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
Here's why they're agreeing

790
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
To work with them

791
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,744
Michelle really about

792
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Positions

793
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,704
I don't think that's necessarily a good idea but they're not in order to build a worldwide

794
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
My brother arrived

795
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
Who you pushing back a tiny bit

796
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
Alex is rhetoric but not nearly enough

797
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
In effect

798
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,991
Alex is not listening

799
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:02,367
No Alex when Joe is talking Alex is not listening

800
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
You didn't need

801
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
To say

802
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
I need to get another

803
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
But he has to interject here because

804
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
It's a whole life

805
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,423
You can say whatever you want but I

806
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,239
I'm drunk

807
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,055
My mind turns off

808
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
Because you are a dumb dumb gorilla

809
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
You're you're just some kind of thing

810
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
You're a thing I am one of the elite damn elevator

811
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
Something later is that really almost

812
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,183
About how great

813
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Budget

814
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,559
Of course in the same way that if Alex is on

815
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Chinese

816
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
We're going to take it

817
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,935
Also if I was there

818
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,495
They hate taking it on the chin for math

819
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,591
Especially imaginary of Haymaker

820
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,431
But if it Alex is on he's also going to talk about chimeras

821
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
I'm fine

822
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,527
Sophie gets into talkin about chimeras and of course

823
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Because this is a show where

824
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,111
There's no time to do research

825
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
There's no time to

826
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Respond

827
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:12,255
Just got behind the board who would like Google something

828
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Alex has the

829
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
The presentation of a good argument

830
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,959
Pig human hybrids in in

831
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
If you go and just Google the basic information

832
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,127
Pride you're right lying about it but there isn't enough time on the show

833
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:33,503
To get the new W get the detail of it and so Alex's depositions are deemed to be like

834
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Oh my God

835
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
That's

836
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
Which is the dangerous thing in one

837
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
I'm sure like that

838
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
A bike

839
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
This is really funny

840
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
Alex.

841
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
These your Camaros

842
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
And then Joe tries to get him

843
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
You talkin about

844
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
And Alex

845
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
His response

846
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
So funny

847
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
Body armor

848
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:02,943
Human animal hybrids 30 years ago

849
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Just p***

850
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,183
It's a freaking deal

851
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,679
But you say he's all many dollars even with her real I believe they are

852
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,751
But you see so many different things

853
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,335
It's hard for each store

854
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,159
For years I mean that's just like the Kevin Spacey line from seven

855
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
For decades

856
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
Narcissistic

857
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,543
Comparison to a literal series

858
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,615
Important

859
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
The Joe is trying to explain to Alex

860
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
I'm still on a what the f*** were you talkin about

861
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
And that's not

862
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Productive way to communicate

863
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
That sort of thing

864
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,999
Trying to talk about these things

865
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
He doesn't seem to realize that

866
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,351
Is part of Alex's manipulative techniques

867
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,655
That he can't stop on a

868
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
Because he needs to be on diori by the time you have heard or else you're going to look into

869
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Be like you're just full of s***

870
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Alex Clare

871
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,735
And also super important

872
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,063
Goats

873
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
Spiders making body armor

874
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,495
Baby baby that's so crazy this whole point is it like

875
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
He's trying

876
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Little moment

877
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
And I don't think that it's

878
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
Just a product of his

879
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,199
Intoxication and flipping

880
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
He just knows it is a thing

881
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
It is a thing she thinks it's a spider

882
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:21,695
It'd be a fun spot whatever the case would be a massive spider that would also be able to

883
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Like with like

884
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
I'm not into that so good later in the episode he talks about how like OSS

885
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,263
CIA was actually British intelligence

886
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
What kind of information

887
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Do you have if you don't know these basic things

888
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
What do you know about f****** chimeras

889
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
If you think spider goats are spiders

890
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Get the f*** out of

891
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,039
That's what I would do

892
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Come on man

893
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
The f*** out of here

894
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,159
So I told Auntie by the way it's the office

895
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
That's right that's right

896
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:05,215
I told you earlier when they were talking about Sandy Hook I felt like they might have accidentally work themselves in

897
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
New lawsuit

898
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
And this clip here is what I was basing this

899
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,103
Conspiracy

900
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,967
About what's going on with him and Sandy

901
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,015
He really shouldn't

902
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
That

903
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,391
I'm sorry

904
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
I'm a wolf at the door

905
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,679
Family stop running around everywhere

906
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
Because the world

907
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:24,063
I like that a lot like those are the moments that Alex is funny but he's not true

908
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:37,375
F*** off.

909
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,935
He's just want them to stop saying

910
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
I'm really hurting

911
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:48,895
Also is he trying to say that the media is running a false flag on him

912
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,247
Like they're reported

913
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,319
You get it correctly the media

914
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
Is actually the ones

915
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
Who are trying to harass the Sandy Hook families

916
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,743
Because they know most pairs

917
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,559
That if they were to say Alex Jones says

918
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
Because the

919
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,887
Because people hate the meteor so much

920
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
They're going to trust Alex Moore

921
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
And then

922
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,799
The media knows this is what's going to happen already off

923
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,895
Then investigate the Sandy Hook I think you're off a little bit

924
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
Right right

925
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,063
That they say that Alex says the same

926
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Is fake

927
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
And the people hate the media

928
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
Therefore they think that that is misreporting

929
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
And trying to cover up something

930
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
If they're saying that it's wrong for someone

931
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
Then it must be

932
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,287
We're going to go to Connecticut

933
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,175
Right in the media is aware that this is what they

934
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,271
I think he's also implying

935
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
Yeah, I don't know yet I think that is

936
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
Represent

937
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Yeah absolutely

938
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,439
The idea that the media is trying to do this in order to

939
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Precipitate

940
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,743
A large terrorist attack

941
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Connecticut to blame on Alex

942
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,583
This is the definition of

943
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
Paranoid narcissism

944
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
Just believing everything is about you

945
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
It's so it's so sad to see it

946
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
Cuz the one thing that he

947
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Could not

948
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
Possibly wrap his head around

949
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Is that

950
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
The media actually doesn't care about him

951
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,015
Only reporting on things based on what he has done

952
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
Right right right

953
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,623
He's gotten so far

954
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Like distinguished

955
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,463
Between what his Straw Men are and what the reality is

956
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
My criticisms that are being

957
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Lobbied against him

958
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,351
I don't know if he's able to tell it like

959
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,959
What's real and what's not like what's his Spin and what people are actually saying

960
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
And it's interesting

961
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Rosetta

962
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,847
Exist on the same episode where he's saying that like

963
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,663
Years ago I realized that there is a

964
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,967
Mild psychosis were taking everything is fake

965
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
Exactly

966
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
How you operate

967
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,927
The ability to have an awareness about that and pin it on your past self

968
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Implies

969
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,047
Some awareness that you're still the hold into those pattern

970
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,703
Do you think this is

971
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
A situation where were

972
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
We're getting Alex

973
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Like without his

974
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
Infowars had on

975
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
He doesn't he's not wear the hat

976
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,199
I mean I mean like this is more genuine

977
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
No

978
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
Yeah you still doing a show

979
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,111
Like

980
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
And how he's just rambling

981
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Keeps

982
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Feels like I'll go ahead go ahead

983
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,839
Like I said he thinks Joe Alex Jones

984
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
Performance right

985
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
It's just conversation

986
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
And it's not an interview it's just Alex

987
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
Rambling about spider goats

988
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,663
How everyone's blaming him for Sandy Hook and I think he's out of Lanza and he's a victim in blah blah blah

989
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,735
Like Jojo

990
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
It's not a 28

991
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,159
A good basis for friendship

992
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
It's not

993
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:18,047
Really abusive behavior that has participated

994
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,375
Yeah because I

995
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,679
In the same ways that I want an explanation

996
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,751
A lot of things and Alex's career and a life

997
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
He's a lunatic

998
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,103
I think the Joe probably explanation

999
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
Why his friend

1000
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,223
I think he hopes for an answer other than

1001
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Oh he's just a crazy person

1002
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
Money

1003
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
So

1004
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,695
He's not yelling on a street corner

1005
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Because his behavior is very

1006
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Very close

1007
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,583
To someone who gets locked in a looney bin

1008
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,191
Or whatever

1009
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,519
You no different than someone in other circumstance

1010
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
P-51

1011
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Orbi home

1012
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
Yeah like that

1013
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,687
Did the last post

1014
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:10,783
And as to which one is with that's the level of impairment Alex is operate

1015
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Eating under

1016
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
These days especially

1017
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
And I think that Joe wants

1018
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
Donation for why

1019
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Unfortunately

1020
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
You listen to this episode

1021
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
If you see

1022
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,583
There's nothing I don't think there's anything there

1023
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Yeah

1024
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
I think it's a little bit like

1025
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Joe is

1026
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,055
Portraying himself as the the person who wants to believe the best in everybody

1027
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
Yeah it's like

1028
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:40,223
Look I know I ate all of this horror all of this Terror right there

1029
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,759
But you're still a human being

1030
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
And I believe there's good inside you

1031
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
Like that kind of s*** when in reality

1032
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,415
What he does say a bunch of times I am cut out these clips

1033
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Because I don't care

1034
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,231
But he does say a number X

1035
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,071
Another reason the same thing you said on the last

1036
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Alex Guarnaschelli

1037
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,263
I wanted to show the world the version of you that I love

1038
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
Right

1039
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
And it's like I think that's

1040
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:10,943
The version of you that I love is the guy who yells at me for 5 hours

1041
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
And there's so much on here that just goes

1042
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
That Joe just left slide

1043
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,879
That I've already talked about all these Sandy Hook lies

1044
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,439
Joseph letting Alex tell

1045
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
He lets him without pushback

1046
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,791
Give this idea of it

1047
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,327
They're trying to plan too large

1048
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,655
Terrorist attack in Connecticut and blame it on him

1049
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
Jordan be like hey that's crazy

1050
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,031
Or anything

1051
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,359
The Joe seems to want

1052
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,199
Is a lion bigger who's clearly mentally Disturbed

1053
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
And then we laugh at

1054
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,295
Which I'm not I'm not thrilled with that

1055
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Whatever

1056
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
Life is what it is

1057
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,183
Yeah

1058
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
Is that Alex

1059
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Heroes of the globalist

1060
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Well we all do

1061
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
And he knows that beak

1062
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Because of

1063
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Primary

1064
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Resources

1065
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
He's talked to the

1066
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:14,431
Leadership

1067
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
Spiders should be doing

1068
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,831
In this next clip Alex brings up a primary source

1069
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Completely lies about

1070
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,415
Cuz Joe doesn't know what this source

1071
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
He doesn't push back on

1072
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,535
Earth is seeing if I can

1073
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,119
To give the propulsion power for this new thing was going to be born

1074
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,983
Artificial intelligence

1075
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,575
Controlled

1076
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Programmers

1077
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Google

1078
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
With the

1079
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,447
The Break-Up

1080
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
I'm so baffled

1081
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
He's baffled because

1082
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Alex

1083
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,383
Literally none of that is in Bill Joyce article

1084
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,943
You can find it we have a link up to it on our website

1085
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,807
Yeah I wrote a big essay about the Bill Joy why the future doesn't need us

1086
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,623
You can go read it yourself doesn't say any of that f******

1087
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,927
The only thing that's close to that

1088
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,511
And Bill Joyce article is when Bill Joy is

1089
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,047
Kaczynski

1090
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:11,935
Right among the elite

1091
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
Or anything like that

1092
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:18,079
He was talking about someone who had a fear of a terrifying future with technology

1093
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
This is.

1094
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Albertsons

1095
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Completely lying about the primary source

1096
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
And because Joe

1097
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
I mean

1098
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
Appreciate his instinctive like

1099
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:37,023
Slowdown Frac pump

1100
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Read that article

1101
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,703
In the time that they have on here

1102
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
It's just it's just pathetic

1103
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
But this is all lies

1104
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
That plan

1105
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Either

1106
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
That the globalist have

1107
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,015
Interesting to me

1108
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Because either

1109
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
It needs to have taken more than one conference to come up with that entire plan

1110
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,279
The same time

1111
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,119
Could have only taken one conference to come up with that

1112
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,727
Like they just kept drinking over.

1113
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
We mailed it

1114
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,799
This playing

1115
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
30

1116
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,871
We're going to follow it to a T

1117
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
I don't think they were talking about 5G

1118
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,247
I think they were I think they knew it

1119
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
I don't think that's

1120
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
30 years is how many years ago

1121
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
20 years ago on years ago

1122
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
Flip phone

1123
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,791
20 years ago they were talking about 1 G

1124
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
Right

1125
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,055
Yeah I guess it's a hypothetical eventual thing

1126
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
We won't make it

1127
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871

1128
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,943

00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:08,159
We would have to have a

1131
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:14,303
We have a locker room environment here at the show I got my daddy's made it already

1132
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
Eric Sierra

1133
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,727
It is next clip they're having a little conversation about Alex's was another one of his talking

1134
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,007
Points is like back in the

1135
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,895
Please plan that they were discussing

1136
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Trying to

1137
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Baum's Atmos

1138
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:37,855
Nuke the atmosphere

1139
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
From like a documentary

1140
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Ladies watch

1141
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,207
Like that and this makes Alex

1142
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:50,143
Adopt

1143
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
Can you sit there

1144
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,551
I don't have an anytime

1145
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,647
I don't have time to go into it as much as you did

1146
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
That's it right there

1147
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:22,911
I don't know all about that

1148
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,959
Nearest you

1149
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
Are you in your family

1150
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
It's okay

1151
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:53,631
This is true

1152
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:58,751
So Alex text me when I say

1153
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:03,871
The government has made.

1154
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
Talkingshit

1155
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
It's not like

1156
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
Oh no he's onto our secret

1157
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
It's it's fun

1158
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
Joe did not realize that Alex

1159
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Was absolutely insulting him

1160
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Yeah he's like

1161
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
Everything you you already do everything I mean a lot of people say you're stupid all the time

1162
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,031
I don't know who saying he's stupid all the

1163
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,663
Meathead or whatever something

1164
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,367
The bigger insult that Alex is making is that you are a coward

1165
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,463
You know all the things that I know and because you want your family to be safe

1166
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,471
I can't look into it because it doesn't exist

1167
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
Like how you want me to look into extra

1168
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
Dimensional aliens make

1169
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Contract

1170
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
With the government go there

1171
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
Joe's on DMT

1172
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:18,623
Which is what Alex is going to conduit through which the government

1173
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:24,255
Alright appearance

1174
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,047
Baboon to his own

1175
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Which obviously it is

1176
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:36,543
Just some of this weirdo friends who also should be on chosen God no

1177
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
Owner of The Joe Rogan embarrassing

1178
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
Alex

1179
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,215
Is it chemicals in the food water

1180
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,823
Jim

1181
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,151
I don't know how to spell it

1182
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
It's muscle memory

1183
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:28,511
It's a way of saying I don't know how to spell it.

1184
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
Reset it

1185
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,007
It doesn't work in the inverse

1186
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,335
It does to some extent if like what you're saying is

1187
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,919
If I write the word I can tell if it looks wrong that's

1188
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,783
If that's what he's trying to express 5 but I can only write it a weird way

1189
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
Nodaway to say also Nick begich if you're curious and don't remember from our show he's the guy who has he faked

1190
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,463
Grief from a Sri Lankan

1191
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,815
Angels Don't Play this heart

1192
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
About

1193
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
The real

1194
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,823
Real cool dude

1195
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,615
He's also a favorite amongst

1196
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
The project

1197
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
So

1198
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
He's real cool

1199
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,759
In this next clip there's another instance

1200
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,599
Sense of Alex bring up something that is ostensibly dependable

1201
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,879
Google search

1202
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,231
I really wish you had written like a like Harry Potter

1203
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
David like

1204
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
A whole series of just like

1205
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,839
Angels Don't Dance

1206
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,423
Numbers of how they're finding you just

1207
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
As like

1208
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:47,103
You switch it around it's like

1209
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,991
This Outfield

1210
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Be nice I don't think he has

1211
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
I think you made enough mileage

1212
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,439
Weirdo

1213
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,535
Speaking circuit for the rest of his life doesn't have to write another book

1214
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:14,239
Does JK Rowling something if you're a weirdo and you write a book and its influence

1215
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:20,895
Thank you could all that strength by writing another book has information if it can be attacked like that

1216
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
Who wrote the

1217
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
I'm a man gorilla whatever was that serve serve

1218
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,367
Gorilla mindset wrote another book and everybody's like yours

1219
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,231
Fair enough

1220
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Control you

1221
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,399
Cell phone towers arm at 2

1222
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,959
Mind control people

1223
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,567
Things if you just do a cursory Google search you can find articles in like scientific

1224
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
American Inn

1225
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,103
And stuff like that

1226
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,455
They don't prove Alex's

1227
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,503
Discuss to be like

1228
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295
Similar technology

1229
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
You know you

1230
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:06,207
Useful in different ways and stuff like that

1231
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
Can bring this up Jamie Google

1232
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
And then

1233
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,423
It's another sleight-of-hand trick that Alex is able to do

1234
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
I don't want to talk about it

1235
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
Is begone Intuit Nora show

1236
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
In the past

1237
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
That's because

1238
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
Ectopic

1239
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Because

1240
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
Leads us to where we going

1241
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Where we going

1242
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
So this is a device

1243
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
By the Gods

1244
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
That

1245
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,255
Has developed

1246
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
What do you mean who do you think made up

1247
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
We will

1248
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:56,127
Research

1249
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,063
Major General General General

1250
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,367
CIA everybody

1251
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
100

1252
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:13,791
Before and after

1253
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:29,151
Which obvious reason

1254
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,015
Bass

1255
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:40,415
Communicating

1256
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
Are these intergalactic

1257
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
2 deals binding

1258
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,143
What's the over by the body

1259
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,215
This is bulshit

1260
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
This is Project Camelot

1261
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,223
I might be might be also I think museums in Los Angeles

1262
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,503
Real f****** close

1263
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Like

1264
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
In terms of

1265
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Just going to Los

1266
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,887
Breakaway civilization with NASA

1267
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,703
Who get the budget of fifty bucks a year

1268
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,543
That's all the shadow budget

1269
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:34,943
That includes a lots of money

1270
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
Like that

1271
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,783
It's like it's like Brittany

1272
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,319
There's a shadow Parliament

1273
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
Are the aliens

1274
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,255
Fair enough

1275
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,959
Major General General General General

1276
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,543
Ayahuasca

1277
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
Conferences

1278
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,199
God this is so disappointing

1279
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,247
This is your big news

1280
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,063
You can't prove any of this

1281
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,879
You're just talkingshit and it doesn't

1282
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
No and it's fun to talk about when your

1283
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
You're high

1284
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,279
And I think that's why Rogan is kind of like not

1285
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:26,399
Probably let him talk

1286
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Alex

1287
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
You are someone

1288
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
Who tries to make

1289
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,311
Real world political

1290
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
Statements

1291
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,895
You are somebody who supports

1292
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
I don't know

1293
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
Bolsonaro

1294
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,527
In Brazil you're someone who now even though for

1295
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Years and years has been

1296
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Like

1297
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Principal

1298
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
Opposed to regime-change

1299
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,719
You are now supporting what's going on in Venezuela

1300
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
You cannot

1301
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,815
Save the big deal

1302
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,887
When you're hunting show that I was listening to this live

1303
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,959
There was like 120 thousand people watching it live

1304
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:05,567
Jesus Christ behind

1305
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
Is

1306
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:10,943
Major General generals during Ayahuasca and make a contract with alien

1307
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
You're a f******

01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
A******

1309
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
You're a joke

1310
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,135
This is this is pathetic I don't like that I feel like he was f****** with

1311
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
That's a little bit with the

1312
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
General

1313
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,767
General General

1314
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:32,703
Hughes is vamping I think a little bit

1315
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Transfer who he's talking to

1316
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:45,247
Bring up the

1317
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,575
Real 40.2 later he says

1318
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
B double bind was

1319
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
3-star General

1320
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,559
Point Break

1321
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,007
Never done DMT

1322
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
Elizabeth

1323
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,359
That's very dumb

1324
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,663
Yep. Dmc4 obviously

1325
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,199
I don't know

1326
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,527
I don't know why they would mess

1327
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,623
If you don't do it for obvious reasons

1328
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,439
The only thing I can think of it's an obvious reason

1329
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
Is it illegal

1330
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Well

1331
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
Yeah but there's ways you can still do it like you know

1332
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,239
Stuff like that there are loopholes and stuff

1333
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
You could do it

1334
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
Without the Legos of I think it's just anything

1335
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Drugs are bad

1336
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,127
Or something like that

1337
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,943
The only obvious reason

1338
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,527
Or he thinks it's intrinsically evil to do those drugs

1339
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,879
Interdimensional beings

1340
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,463
Because he's not afraid of anything

1341
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
But I don't know

1342
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,023
The point is

1343
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
He's never done for obvious reasons

1344
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
But

1345
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
Basically.

1346
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:14,079
What does Michael alien an alien landed right now in our parking lot in a little gray

1347
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,407
Big black ice

1348
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,967
On psychedelic trip

1349
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
I just don't think he's ready for it

1350
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
Oxygen

1351
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,655
Brains

1352
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,519
Sleep apnea

1353
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,847
Oxygen

1354
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,551
First Memories Forever

1355
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,975
I want to see child

1356
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,767
Are going to shot I've seen ever

1357
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Everything

1358
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,375
God dammit

1359
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
I I have

1360
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,007
Mild hallucinations every night so

1361
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:20,895
Know that aliens are real It's seems unlikely to that he's had this his whole life

1362
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,175
You know like if what he's

1363
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,735
Describing is like his super out of shape missing

1364
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,015
Massive neck

1365
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
Causes

1366
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Sleep apnea

1367
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,367
But that's more of a recent development

1368
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
His wife

1369
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
It does seem that what like

1370
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
I don't know

1371
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,511
I don't care to litigate that

1372
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
Really I just bring that up as like

1373
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,863
Alex trying to sort of big dick

1374
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,655
Prior Lake

1375
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,471
You've done DMT and Ayahuasca a couple times

1376
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:51,103
I do it every night buddy I know more I've seen everything

1377
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
This is

1378
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,199
I got bad news for you I'm above your turf

1379
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
What a dick

1380
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
What a f****** dick

1381
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:04,927
You pretty pretty bad

1382
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,487
You think that's cool

1383
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,767
Guess what

1384
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,047
F***

1385
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,863
It's 91 of the story it's one of the license

1386
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Is everything

1387
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Yeah

1388
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,239
Gross

1389
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Right

1390
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,311
In the episode

1391
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,663
Beginning to the first instance of Alex talking about childhood memory

1392
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,759
There are a number of them that some of them are pretty close to

1393
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,063
We've heard before

1394
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,599
And those things

1395
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
Are flushed out a little bit more cuz he's wasted

1396
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,487
I meant some of them are completely new development

1397
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,303
That leads me to one of my new conclusion

1398
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,143
Did Alex Jones Is Dead David Jones

1399
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,935
Might be a complete lunatic

1400
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,751
Right though

1401
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
Touchdown him in the Sun

1402
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,871
But like you know he he was clearly into the John Birch Society

1403
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,687
And he had some weird influences the past down to Alex

1404
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,991
But some of these stories that

1405
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
Hotels

1406
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
AR

1407
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,111
It's hard to say with the line is

1408
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,415
Between like Alex's dad possibly crazy

1409
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Or

1410
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
Alex

1411
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,511
Wheatley Miss remembers things from his youth

1412
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
And is allowing his dad to

1413
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Baby cats

1414
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,863
As a lunatic

1415
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,959
Backstory remove the probably from technically probably

1416
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Bleach kill a guy

1417
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:28,127
Maybe we'll get that that'll be at the end of this episode

1418
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
So

1419
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,479
It is first one Alex was 7 years old

1420
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,295
And he heard his dad talking about his

1421
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
Free practice

1422
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,111
But Molly was more there than meets

1423
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
The 200 boy

1424
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Dishonor

1425
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,607
Okay why

1426
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
Probably

1427
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,447
20 years ago

1428
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,775
Before anybody else is talking about The Clockwork elves

1429
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,639
Precise

1430
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
Not the CIA

1431
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,015
Walmart

1432
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,575
I don't know what that means

1433
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,367
Never been part of any other stuff

1434
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:16,767
DARPA research projects

1435
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
That I don't know all the details about

1436
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Because they want

1437
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:41,599
Program in Maryland and underground basin

1438
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,623
I want you out of this

1439
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:18,719
Bored

1440
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
Okay

1441
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,839
Okay

1442
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:30,239
So a couple things I find really important in there one is that he calls his parents by their first name

1443
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,311
As opposed to like highlighting hair relation

1444
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
To each other

1445
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
Which is weird

1446
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
I meant

1447
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,735
Like I don't understand why his dad

1448
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:46,111
Movie like I can't talk about this National Security project

1449
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,951
But that's what you're not supposed to talk about

1450
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,303
About this

1451
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,095
That's how Alex talks

1452
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,167
That's how Alex reveals information

1453
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:03,263
The prefaces things like I am I can't get into these I'm not supposed to talk about this

1454
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,359
Give this more as an expression

1455
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Alex Jones

1456
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
From his childhood

1457
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
Then

1458
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,759
Actually actually a memory

1459
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Of his dad explaining

1460
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
2

1461
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,647
What was going on with these two cyborgs

1462
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,999
Either that or DDS David was

1463
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,863
I think that if if Alexandra

1464
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,911
Whole time

1465
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,239
Is brought a horrible

1466
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,519
But I think I did

1467
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,823
I think that even if he wasn't f****** with him there's

1468
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,895
Clear indications that he's allowed Alex to

1469
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
I believe these things

1470
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
4

1471
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Without correct

1472
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:51,391
Or maybe he just doesn't give a s*** you know it wasn't working on f****** cyborg

1473
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
When you were a kid that's ridiculous

1474
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,463
And Alex is like

1475
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,743
I just hear you

1476
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
Confessing quite frankly

1477
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:08,799
But you made two cyborgs CIA has a rule about

1478
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,335
Well

1479
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:16,735
Let go for it but I mean like going under in in that kind of thing like getting any kind of laugh

1480
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,575
I'm positive that there's some sort of like

1481
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
NDA

1482
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,903
Yeah it sucks because of

1483
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,511
If you're unconscious or I'm in Twilight or whatever something

1484
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,535
That you

1485
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,839
Shouldn't exactly that sort of thing

1486
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:39,007
But with DDS David which is the new way that I'm going to say it

1487
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
Hey man

1488
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
I could definitely see a situation where

1489
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,527
If you had to go under anesthesia or something like that for 3 minutes

1490
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,831
They would only allow a dentist

1491
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,135
Or Doctor Who had been vetted

1492
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,671
Manhattan mdan

1493
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:03,071
In-Place yapping like that or I could see it being a thing where you can own

1494
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
Only get local anesthetic

1495
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:10,751
Or topical anesthetic Novocaine

1496
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,775
Best of YouTube

1497
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,592
Revealing comforter is too high

1498
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
Or

1499
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,688
Impossibility

1500
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,224
Wow that's a fourth possibility

1501
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,296
Discount Tire

1502
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,112
Syrupy like you can go in but you're always being monitor

1503
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:32,512
Like someone is there

1504
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,304
In order to make sure you don't say

1505
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,864
I like to imagine that at Tache has a

1506
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,264
So I don't know whatever is cases I don't believe Alex

1507
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
His story is

1508
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,592
Your old memories

1509
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,920
Wingstop

1510
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,736
Is not on the up-and-up

1511
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
Or at least

1512
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
What does version of hip

1513
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
Because Alex showed him endgame

1514
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
When he was making it

1515
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:06,560
His dad endgame response

1516
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,448
This is all bulshit

1517
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Is that

1518
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Quite different

1519
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,544
My dad never told me about all this stuff

1520
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,080
Boulder chill

1521
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
20 year old daughter she's like 14 hour

1522
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,912
They should have like an hour to watch

1523
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,032
That's not true

1524
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
It's all true

1525
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,944
I was in junior high school recruiting of the program there

1526
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,040
Everybody

1527
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:04,672
Government

1528
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:11,072
Special

1529
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,168
Smartest in Texas

1530
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,032
This is stuff we talked about before David globalist work

1531
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:26,432
But

1532
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,832
I didn't harm enough people

1533
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:39,232
Villain before these kids the plan or not

1534
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Reject the offer

1535
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
Or whatever

1536
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,864
It's a completely ludicrous childish idea

1537
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,680
Of how some sort of operation would work

1538
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,216
He's talking about Ender's Game

1539
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
Yeah that's what it is

1540
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,664
Yeah probably

1541
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,272
I trust you

1542
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:08,928
But this is a child's understanding or something and child hero-worship their dad

1543
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
I don't even believe

1544
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Leave the

1545
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,792
Statewide test

1546
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:19,936
Exists to decide who the smartest kid in Texas

1547
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,240
I found this out

1548
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,288
Get that out but I mean

1549
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:30,688
You need some DMT and figured it out

1550
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:38,368
Blood

1551
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,184
Bring it up

1552
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,488
He doesn't have much SB Raptors

1553
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:51,680
Are you angling for Carrie

1554
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,264
Absolutely

1555
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,056
So

1556
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,336
Alex brings up

1557
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
Abortion

1558
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,640
And

1559
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,664
Cowboy

1560
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:05,248
They have a little conversation about how there are

1561
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,784
People who are trying

1562
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,576
Babies alive

1563
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
Just Elder Oregon

1564
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
Post-birth

1565
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,000
Right Center in Virginia

1566
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
Was talking about when

1567
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
In Black

1568
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,096
Nope

1569
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,888
But we do find out why that happened

1570
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
Racist black Facebook

1571
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Now what about that

1572
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:29,312
I really think it was right might have initially been but the reason story came forward is because

1573
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,616
Will get to work

1574
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
But

1575
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
Blackface

1576
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,456
Actually what we call it now

1577
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,064
We'll get to that in a second

1578
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
But in this next

1579
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,136
Alex talks about how abortion is

1580
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,928
Just about stealing babies

1581
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Is Oregon

1582
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720
I have some thoughts

1583
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:10,784
I'm confused

1584
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,488
Well I didn't see that I am very

1585
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:25,888
Very concerned with late-term abortion

1586
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,448
Poster how much money

1587
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,592
Wait a minute lyrics

1588
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,688
Oregon

1589
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,928
The fifty grand for a fetus

1590
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:53,280
But your 500,000

1591
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,840
His whole argument about chimera

1592
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
Is there trying to

1593
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,912
Create organ harvesting

1594
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
Type things

1595
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,752
Chimera

1596
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
Kind of defeats the purpose of chimeras

1597
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
These are kind of the same thing

1598
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:12,992
I don't understand why you need both

1599
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
Rates are going down of course

1600
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,880
Wow you got to eat for not having enough kids

1601
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:25,280
I know I know Jim Cramer for mad money is big massive is always Diversified portfolio

1602
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
That's true I guess my complaint

1603
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,496
They control a lot more oil so we're trying to find our own sources

1604
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
Energy

1605
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,312
Women control all the babies

1606
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,896
We can't be having that we got to make sure that their stuff was that.

1607
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,456
So creating spider

1608
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
It makes perfect sense

1609
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,064
Make sense entire argument hinges

1610
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,184
Around the idea that the governor of Virginia was on a radio show was asked about

1611
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,464
A measure that

1612
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
Was being

1613
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
Scuffed

1614
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
That would

1615
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,584
Put No Limit really on when abortion

1616
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
Could be

1617
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,680
Done

1618
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:08,800
I don't like between the between the appropriate care of a physician

1619
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
And a woman

1620
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,104
There should not be

1621
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,920
Appropriate

1622
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,504
Of course you know you need to have doctors

1623
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,040
You know what they're doing interacting

1624
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
Responsibly

1625
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
Unfortunately

1626
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,952
But

1627
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,232
I don't like

1628
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,792
40 something year old men talking about abortion

1629
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,352
. no like I don't like it

1630
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:37,472
I kind of don't even don't even like when we talked about it other than to be like

1631
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,240
Hey

1632
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
Go for it if you want it

1633
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,224
Because Alex and Jo at 4 start it would be

1634
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:56,160
Consider is that Ralph Northam

1635
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,952
Get on this radio show

1636
01:27:59,232 --> 01:27:59,744
Something

1637
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,096
The effect of actor

1638
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,888
Keep the

1639
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,424
The baby

1640
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Comfortable

1641
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:10,240
And resuscitated if that's what the

1642
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,664
He wasn't precise enough in his language and he was speaking really poorly but what he was talking about he's a non-viable

1643
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
Stillborn

1644
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
Bye

1645
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:27,136
Being by labor a non-viable child or child with a birth defect like

1646
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
Examples

1647
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
You can find all over the place like a child

1648
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
The brain

1649
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,120
Or something like that

1650
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
Abortion

1651
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
Not talking

1652
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
About euthanasia already

1653
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,776
Like that talk about a very very rare situation

1654
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,824
Where in

1655
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,104
Looking up baby is

1656
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Born

1657
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Completely on

1658
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Yeah

1659
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,760
If the parent does water resuscitated and try

1660
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,928
Keep it alive yeah then why would they not do that right in the meantime keeping the baby comfort

1661
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Super Bowl 2

1662
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
The greatest extent you can

1663
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
Isn't

1664
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,352
Necessarily some sort of a weird nefarious

1665
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
They're making

1666
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,656
Are complete

1667
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,192
Movie bad argument out of

1668
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,496
Intentionally misunderstanding with the guys

1669
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,848
And I got no skin in the game

1670
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,664
How could you not have empathy

1671
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
24vac

1672
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Situation where

1673
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
It's a baby is alive

1674
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,832
You know you don't most rather it was stillborn

1675
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,648
Because the babies alive and they're trying

1676
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
To keep it alive for something slowly die

1677
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,352
Ladies come out

1678
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
And she got

1679
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,680
Did not have a late-term abortion

1680
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,984
Because it was very difficult for her

1681
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
To get one in the

1682
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
Yeah

1683
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,080
And she had this child

1684
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
I am

1685
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
She

1686
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,432
Did she had got a later

1687
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Proportion

1688
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,248
Because the child ended up

1689
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
So many

1690
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,320
Medical complications

1691
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,368
Spend so much money trying

1692
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,208
Keep it alive it still died anyway

1693
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Of being born

1694
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,024
And there wasn't

1695
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,048
Like

1696
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,096
It's still in utero that that was going to

1697
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
To be the case yeah

1698
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,168
But you couldn't travel across state line

1699
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,960
Get the abortion pill

1700
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:21,824
Brutal and that's exactly the sort of situation

1701
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
This governor was talking

1702
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,176
To feed Hugh

1703
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
Anti-abortion

1704
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
And a position

1705
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
How come you're out

1706
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,808
Take position

1707
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,856
I want to watch a parent

1708
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
B torture

1709
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,416
And then have them watched

1710
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,584
Cuz he doesn't care

1711
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,120
Talk about in the crassest

1712
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
Possible

1713
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,936
It's because everybody on the right

1714
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
Really understand

1715
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
Maintaining this abortion

1716
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,312
Is essential to them ever winning an election

1717
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:56,384
Go vote

1718
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,784
A big part of how they hinge the evangelicals without that block block this Within

1719
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
The right-wing

1720
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,576
Coalition

1721
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,648
Exactly

1722
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,184
The single-issue floaters

1723
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
In terms of abortion

1724
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:15,072
The right-wing in the GOP alive right and so you have to

1725
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,448
If you give even an inch

1726
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,240
It's going to be whittled away

1727
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
Yeah guns and abortion

1728
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
Go to the biggest

1729
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,336
Little Owl

1730
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
The GOP

1731
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Conservative

1732
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:34,016
Built their f****** party into giving all of their money away

1733
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:39,136
Yo G

1734
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,464
That don't fit with like let's say the evangelicals

1735
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
God I hate everything

1736
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,024
So anyway

1737
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,608
Alex is wrong about this makes a meal out of talking about it

1738
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
That's gross

1739
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,912
And then he plays the video

1740
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,472
He has been played as boj me.

1741
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
And yeah

1742
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,056
Do you know Governor Northam does day

1743
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,360
You keep the baby comfortable

1744
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,408
And he does have a bit of a Southern accent so Alex

1745
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,760
To be like that didn't I do a good impression

1746
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,064
Because they have that like that

1747
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,624
That

1748
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952
And they don't have

1749
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:20,352
Explanatory context or anything like that there's no time for that on the show

1750
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,680
I told you the governor said Vicky babies alive

1751
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,984
Therefore my conjecture that they

1752
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,752
Keep them alive

1753
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,544
For two weeks the Harvester Oregon

1754
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
He's also true

1755
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,384
And Joe doesn't have a foot to stand on because

1756
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,712
Got his mind blown by this clip of Governor Northam

1757
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:40,832
Really goddamn that's how this works what happened literally

1758
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,416
All I can think of while if you're if you're putting clip

1759
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,952
My next thought is like

1760
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
Tell me how this makes sense

1761
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,144
Because this is this is

1762
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:58,496
Because you're sitting next to duplicitous

1763
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
I know

1764
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:06,176
So Alex needs a little bit more support for his argument other than this

1765
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,712
Completely misrepresented

1766
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
Clip of the governor

1767
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,080
Okay

1768
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,432
What kind of would it be like a is it like a stealth cleaning van

1769
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
Thought

1770
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:47,136
Check project

1771
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:52,256
Manipulative

1772
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,048
Edited videos about

1773
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
Planned Parenthood

1774
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:00,448
This is the Center for Medical progress videos that came out in 2015

1775
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
Completely

1776
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:06,592
The dirt like manipulative Lee additive that got these guys in a bit of hot water about Italy

1777
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,896
Videotaping

1778
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,176
These people without consent

1779
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
A misrepresenting what

1780
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,504
Full tapes

1781
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,528
Show right

1782
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,576
So I was just bored

1783
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
Happens

1784
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,208
So

1785
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,256
When you actually do that

1786
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
You get into legal trouble

1787
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:30,144
Droop and ilex

1788
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
So

1789
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,984
Yeah we'll get back to this topic of Alex's

1790
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,568
About abortion a little bit later because he has a bit of a blow up

1791
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,920
And start screaming in a probably fake way but also see

1792
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Kind of real

1793
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
Terrifyingly angry where 14

1794
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:01,888
You're a revelation

1795
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,176
Mercedes

1796
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,480
Incredible

1797
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
13

1798
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
But

1799
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:41,056
There's so many levels

1800
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,080
Like just like

1801
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Just

1802
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,408
Like if you take even the having sex with

1803
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
With this

1804
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
Older woman

1805
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,552
At the top of the equation

1806
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,344
Being in the household

1807
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,904
Experiencing something like that

1808
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,232
Look at that he's just friends with this girl and he's over in the dads like

1809
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,792
I f***** my daughter go to join our satanic cult

1810
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
That would be deeply traumatizing

1811
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,144
Incorporated

1812
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,936
You think the sex with her was awesome

1813
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
V

1814
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,008
Oh yeah at least

1815
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
It's

1816
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,104
You are not capable of processing

1817
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Sexual inter

1818
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,456
Intercourse and the intimacy that comes along with it when your 13

1819
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,760
A seventeen-year-old girl

1820
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,088
Having sex with a 13 year old boy is abuse

1821
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:30,720
Is profoundly f***** up I don't care if Alex looks like he was 16 at the time

1822
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,024
Or anything like that that is not good

1823
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,816
Very thetis

1824
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,400
Very bad now when I was 15 I was dating

1825
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:42,240
Somebody older than me she was 17 she was a senior at the

1826
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,312
And it was very much like

1827
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
Sleep together

1828
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,128
Because that was a whole mess

1829
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,456
You know like it that was one of those things were both of us were like

1830
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,504
Warren High School list

1831
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Just be

1832
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
Cool

1833
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,344
I think that's good

1834
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,160
I also want to say I'm sorry I didn't mean to

1835
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:03,232
Cut you off

1836
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,512
Expressing I don't think

1837
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
He tried to get it

1838
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
Get inducted into a satanic cult

1839
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:12,448
I think that's probably just his weird fantasizing

1840
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
Memory

1841
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,288
That's probably a function of him being

1842
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,592
Really f***** up

1843
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,944
But can you imagine going anywhere

1844
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,504
And having somebody's father who you're

1845
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,088
Fishing with say I sleep with her too that doesn't end in like

1846
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,392
Best Joker

1847
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
No

1848
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:36,768
Okay cool I'm going to run as far as I do

1849
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:40,864
So I don't care

1850
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,936
Alexander like the idea to satanic cult

1851
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,728
Tried to get him involved in

1852
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,008
Part of the

1853
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:54,176
He said that he was a hardcore Satanist on a past episode

1854
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
With it

1855
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:01,088
Cuz this isn't trying to get recruited into a satanic group

1856
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,136
Now a little bit later he says

1857
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,416
In order to get into

1858
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
Groups you have to kill your dog

1859
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,000
What

1860
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:08,768
Yeah

1861
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,864
Yeah you don't say that

1862
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,984
It's implied

1863
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,616
He's presenting it as like I would never do that I never did that

1864
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:29,504
If not necessarily his dog maybe was just a dog with rabies

1865
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
He said he had to stop at the

1866
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
Lakeview little

1867
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,464
The little parts

1868
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,328
You killed dog in order to get into a satanic cult that is a possible

1869
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:49,472
Believe most

1870
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
Cruelty

1871
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,568
Is one of those Signature Signs of Assyria

1872
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Real killer

1873
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,152
I believe you was cruel to animals but I don't believe

1874
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
The window dressing over

1875
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,480
The story

1876
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,528
The satanic cult that Dad was f******

1877
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,296
King's Daughter

1878
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,064
Alex

1879
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,880
I believe maybe he had inappropriate sexual relations

1880
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,536
As a younger man

1881
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,632
Trauma involved in that and not processing it in any real way

1882
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
No

1883
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,544
Here is something that Alex says

1884
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,336
That

1885
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,944
Is really one of the reasons why Joe should think twice about having him on his show

1886
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,528
And also if you're going to let him be on the show

1887
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,576
Push back on things like

1888
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
Because joke.

1889
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,160
This is so f***** up

1890
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,280
Works there

1891
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:55,008
And they're tough and

1892
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,128
Cool

1893
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:04,480
And just a little bit

1894
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,528
Cuz they're powerful

1895
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
Why is that

1896
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,288
Chinese

1897
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:39,552
Like that

1898
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:58,496
Mongols Seattle Marvel

1899
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:16,672
I'll give you think about Japan Japan has a long history of being a noble Warrior culture with a samurai

1900
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,744
All the martial arts of compliment

1901
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,168
Oh boy

1902
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:35,104
I said presented without comment because I refuse to even engage

1903
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,152
Alex

1904
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,432
Deeply fuk up

1905
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,736
Crazy crazy things

1906
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
This is something

1907
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,904
Want to ask because I do feel like it's in Port

1908
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:53,024
Joe is coming off like the shittiest piece of s***

1909
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,304
That

1910
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Could be

1911
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,352
In your clips

1912
01:41:56,608 --> 01:42:00,704
Confirm that this is the tenor of the interview

1913
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
And not like

1914
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,312
Cuz you clips about Alec

1915
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:09,664
Yeah have his highlight-reel

1916
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,064
A little bit further

1917
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,088
Variable

1918
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
The changes every

1919
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,672
But I will say this

1920
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,464
I don't want to say look he's a thing

1921
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:33,216
Fully understood that Alex was lying to him about the even

1922
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,008
First 20 minutes or so of like

1923
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
F***** up

1924
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,592
Does Alex comes in with a head of steam

1925
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:42,688
And he's just ranting while Joe tries to respond

1926
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:47,552
Slowing down

1927
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,088
Going to be whatever I want it

1928
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,648
Right-leaning Intuit

1929
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:56,768
Instead of being like Alex what are you saying Native Americans are easy to mine

1930
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,072
Control

1931
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,096
Prove your promise

1932
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,144
Or anything like that he's just like

1933
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:05,728
Well do you think there's a cultural explanation for why

1934
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,800
Asian militaries like military turd

1935
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:13,664
Vision goes the way that it does in China

1936
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,016
Because I think he's a little bit realizes

1937
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
He's playing handball with the curtains

1938
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,648
Play an actual game or have a real time

1939
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:26,720
Alex is going to get the points you want across

1940
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,280
Emily soon is Joe response not like Alex will take

1941
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
Conversation

1942
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,584
In a new direction that he can

1943
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,864
In control

1944
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,960
Do a certain extent it is still a show

1945
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:40,032
So he can either have a

1946
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:46,432
Or he can have a fight and then it's over after an hour

1947
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:51,040
Is Merrick

1948
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,464
I think what's going on to is

1949
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Is that like

1950
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,328
Yeah it's just sort of like a Don't Rock the Boat

1951
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
Kind of thing

1952
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
8 a recognition of like

1953
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
What would we going to do

1954
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,472
What's

1955
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,008
What's the what's the game that

1956
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:11,776
Going to play but

1957
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,824
Question more specifically

1958
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,640
You're saying but Joe's coming off like a pilot

1959
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,968
I think there's an argument you could make that that's a fair assessment

1960
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,272
But I also think there's an argument

1961
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:25,344
Could make of him being a showman in the situation

1962
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,392
Moderate

1963
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
Whatever is

1964
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,184
Being sad is bestie

1965
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,744
You can and then just doing a terrible job

1966
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,048
I don't think it's

1967
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
Penchant

1968
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,168
But I also think he doesn't recognize

1969
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:43,264
Yeah I think he gets caught up in trying to make sense of Alex's

1970
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:44,544
Words

1971
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Rhetoric

1972
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
And he misses

1973
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,128
He misses point a

1974
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,408
Because Alex is already on

1975
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,992
Right right right

1976
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,088
It's one of the intrinsic problems why you should never have Alex on your show

1977
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,112
He's going to say things

1978
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,648
You're just incapable of

1979
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
Responding to

1980
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,208
And then it's broadcast

1981
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,000
Unchallenged unquestioned

1982
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,840
On your show right

1983
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:13,728
And more people after-the-fact record of like either

1984
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,312
You don't challenge him and he says a ton of b*******

1985
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,592
And you gave him a platform

1986
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,152
Challenge him

1987
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:23,712
And he gets in a fight with you and then he gets

1988
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:29,600
Even more publicity gets really weird like that Patrick bet-david

1989
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,672
Yeah that's it

1990
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,720
It's like a

1991
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,792
The only way to win

1992
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,352
Like that's the situation there's more game

1993
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,120
I agree

1994
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,912
So you talk about these genetic

1995
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,240
Mind control ability

1996
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,288
Levels of various races

1997
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,592
Isn't good

1998
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:54,688
The type of racism that you're like this is bad racism but also

1999
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
I mean nobody else is throwing that racism around I think so people are I think there are

2000
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,904
Pacific point

2001
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Pretty specific

2002
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:07,232
Offshoot of a lot of

2003
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,792
This sort of race realism the

2004
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:16,960
Racism

2005
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,240
Yeah those those sort

2006
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,056
I think there is some of that

2007
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,384
Which is naturally transitions into

2008
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,664
I talked about him

2009
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:29,504
About how like

2010
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,904
The Japanese and the white so this must be televised

2011
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:40,000
I don't care about that we don't need to listen to that but it leads

2012
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Is preposterous

2013
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,888
For sure yeah

2014
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,912
Is this

2015
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:53,568
There's test that you can run terms of math

2016
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,336
Psychic

2017
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:02,784
My skill is a swamp music

2018
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
That's not why they

2019
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
That's how I

2020
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:17,376
I don't think anyone would give a s***

2021
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,728
The song morph acknowledge and all of that

2022
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,752
That's so stupid

2023
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Complains about

2024
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,848
People making accusations

2025
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616
Oceans about him

2026
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:28,896
The real world

2027
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:32,736
Deeply ironic

2028
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:39,648
Stephen Colbert

2029
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,464
Well that's unfortunate

2030
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:48,864
And then people yelled at you

2031
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:55,008
Houston died our actors as it got harassed and got death threats

2032
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,544
I don't give a fuk

2033
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,360
If someone yelled at you could someone made a joke about you

2034
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,896
In a late night show

2035
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
I mean sure

2036
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:05,248
I don't like any kind of harassment falling on people I think that's

2037
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,784
I would support that

2038
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,600
I'm sure that Stephen Colbert didn't say that Alex

2039
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,624
The clan member

2040
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:17,024
I'm sure there was a joke that he was making that compared to the two or something like that

2041
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,120
Welcome back to you

2042
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:27,520
Listen

2043
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:33,920
The guys that Alex was a clan member but

2044
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,784
I take no pleasure in reporting this to you Alex Jones at the clan member

2045
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,648
Interview with Bradley Cooper

2046
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:50,560
Knock knock

2047
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:55,168
What Alex did to the Sandy Hook

2048
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,472
Any kind of

2049
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,800
It's a hymn to be like I'm a victim of this negative attention

2050
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,848
Does people melt Molina me

2051
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,664
Take a pick a number ass-whole

2052
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:12,064
Way more guilty of that than anybody else so I'm going to revoke that victim card from

2053
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
Go fuc yourself

2054
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:17,440
Alex talks about how he knows a guy

2055
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,208
In the UFC

2056
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,488
Who you want

2057
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:20,768
He will not die

2058
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,072
He's about to name that guy

2059
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:29,472
He's not

2060
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,664
But then things turned bad because

2061
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Because the network

2062
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
That is strange

2063
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
Demand

2064
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,880
Okay

2065
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,416
Okay

2066
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:51,232
Monster

2067
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,768
This is incredible

2068
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,120
Set alarm for this new big lucrative shall what they said

2069
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,680
You're going to come out to downtown Alex Jones on the show

2070
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,336
On the show

2071
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,384
Well they need that from you

2072
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:16,320
Yeah but why would they need that from him

2073
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,112
But that gives you even more tension

2074
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:22,976
They're Duluth

2075
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:28,864
Ponderosa

2076
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:33,984
Going to give you a few specifically denounced Alex Jones

2077
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,800
The cooking show

2078
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:39,616
Okay

2079
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,432
I believe you

2080
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:46,016
I believe you but I'm saying it just seemed so crazy

2081
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,344
To denounce you on the television show I'm not saying it's impossible

2082
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,136
That's what everybody

2083
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
You're a rarity

2084
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:06,496
This is the moment where Joe is like hey dude I am actually in

2085
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,800
Show Business

2086
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:15,200
Done all of that I've been given not how it goes

2087
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,368
And how everybody has to denounce your else

2088
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:28,768
It is the mark of the beast is saying that Alex Jones

2089
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:32,608
Close to where JoJo lives USB related

2090
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,888
8 he's trying to

2091
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:38,752
Appeal to Jodi like they're people you entering

2092
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,032
Could be you next

2093
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:51,808
At the end of the few

2094
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,088
No he's pandering

2095
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:59,744
The only people whose Independence and does their own thing

2096
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:05,120
Reneging on all of the things that he said about Joan the last month or so

2097
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,400
You said that you

2098
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,192
Complete shell all this stuff

2099
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:14,592
Easy protective recognizing exactly

2100
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,616
What's going on

2101
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:21,504
In both that story and not recognizing the same thing is going on on his show

2102
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,552
Wait

2103
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:26,368
If that guidance is that only give you more attention

2104
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,672
And you liked it

2105
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:35,840
Are you get it understand

2106
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,656
That he's giving Alex more attention but I think he thinks

2107
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:43,008
More harmless than he is because he doesn't recognize those things that Alex says that are

2108
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,568
Completely not based in reality that our soup

2109
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,336
Super dangerous

2110
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,872
And racist

2111
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,640
Native American

2112
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:51,200
To mind control

2113
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:53,760
He doesn't recognize that it being is toxic

2114
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:57,600
Cancerous

2115
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,392
Whatever

2116
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:05,792
He's obsessed with being the guy who I'll talk to whoever looking at Tyson on the other day like not the other day but little bit

2117
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:17,568
Is really gone up Stars

2118
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,200
Joe's obsessed with that

2119
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:31,648
Don't care right-wing left-wing it's important

2120
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,416
Interesting

2121
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,720
First Alex came for the Native Americans

2122
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,792
Then he went for the Asians

2123
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:38,816
And I said nothing

2124
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,120
But he came at me about UFC

2125
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
And I'm going to shut

2126
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,192
Right I'm going to push back pretty hard

2127
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,520
Like the two of them had a bit of a fight

2128
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:50,080
I think it's an open question how much

2129
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,384
Of that was up.

2130
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,920
On Alex's part

2131
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,712
The intensity with which he

2132
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,992
You followed through with it

2133
01:53:57,248 --> 01:54:01,344
And like I said the level

2134
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,112
Streets

2135
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
And stuff like that betrayed

2136
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,672
Confidences

2137
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,048
If that's what Alex was intended

2138
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,120
If he was trying to bait him into a war

2139
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
Or something like that

2140
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,424
That makes sense

2141
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:21,824
But the end result of that wouldn't be to get on his show

2142
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,152
You know some sort of

2143
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,688
Yeah but

2144
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,224
Whatever the case is Alex

2145
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,504
Explain for this next cliff

2146
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,552
What he felt the breaking point

2147
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,832
With Joe was

2148
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
When he realized this guy

2149
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,392
Too far gone

2150
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,672
I got to take him on

2151
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:39,744
Where

2152
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:42,304
When I saw you was Breaking Point

2153
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:46,400
Do shelters full of crap George Soros

2154
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:52,544
Was a victim of the Nazis and Holocaust

2155
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,104
I go the story that I watch the interview

2156
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:58,432
And I don't know what he did I don't know I don't know him

2157
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:00,480
I don't know I've no very little about him

2158
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:03,552
Remember from the story was that he was saying

2159
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,600
The one the Nazis occupied

2160
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:08,928
He was with his I believe it was his uncle

2161
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:15,328
Is Godfather and took him around as a Christian and pretended he was a Christian where they were stealing from these Jews

2162
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,608
Hollywood

2163
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,632
Take the end

2164
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:21,216
He just thought it was normal because you was 13 years old but was talking about it

2165
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:23,264
It did he was shielded by the

2166
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,592
Disperse

2167
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,360
What

2168
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640
What

2169
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:33,248
Well then it's over I would be willing

2170
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:35,808
Wow I mean to be fair he does go on to say

2171
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
Eddie doesn't

2172
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:40,672
But it is more reasonable

2173
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:44,768
I'm irrational because he's talking like I watch that interview

2174
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,560
You can't pull the like

2175
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,328
Sleight of hand

2176
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,632
That you normally do I know what you're talkin

2177
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:52,704
And about your version of it isn't true

2178
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,008
Start with that qualification

2179
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,312
I don't believe that interpretation

2180
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,640
He says

2181
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:03,712
It's worse for Alex after he explains why he doesn't take that into a

2182
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,160
Joe Rogan

2183
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,792
Goodies to eat to settle that was just taking proper

2184
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:22,400
Now they work

2185
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:27,264
This is b******* already been taken away

2186
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,056
The Godfather was part of cleanup

2187
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:32,640
Cruise that would go around to the houses of people who

2188
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,200
It's not Alex and presenting it as

2189
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:39,552
They showed up. And then yeah

2190
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:42,112
Supposed to

2191
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,160
Catalog the property

2192
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,184
Nazis were going

2193
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,744
Yeah this is b*******

2194
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,024
If Alex knew anything

2195
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,792
If you would know that

2196
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,584
He's trying to presented as

2197
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,864
They were the

2198
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:57,216
I don't know what the Silver Surfer that came around us via The Herald

2199
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:59,008
Of the Nazis

2200
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,824
Rare is coming to me

2201
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:02,848
Circus World

2202
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,384
I don't know

2203
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:10,272
I mean

2204
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,856
It was more

2205
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:21,792
George Soros

2206
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:24,608
Cuz I don't know much about it

2207
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:30,240
Feed the real Absolute Auto on Shepherd

2208
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,520
No it's f****** not

2209
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:35,360
It's open to interpretation you have Justin validated your entire arm

2210
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:38,944
If you are just saying that this is how I look at it

2211
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,224
Then you are

2212
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,504
You can't make the claims that

2213
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,272
But you do

2214
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:45,600
Especially when you presented as fact

2215
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:50,720
A million times

2216
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,024
Nazi collaborator it's not

2217
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,304
From his words

2218
01:57:54,560 --> 01:58:00,704
I get the sense that he was a Nazi collaborator

2219
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,472
Collaborator

2220
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,496
He's reporting it

2221
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,288
The fact that he's on Rogan show

2222
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,312
And Rogan

2223
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,616
Smallest amount of pushback on this guy

2224
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:10,688
That's not what I said no so that interview doesn't say what you're saying

2225
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,224
It's a matter of interpretation

2226
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,504
Because he knows that he

2227
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,528
He pushes harder

2228
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:17,344
Or like if Joe pushes harder or is Alex's

2229
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,928
No absolutely

2230
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:23,488
How do you know that and it's like no answer

2231
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:29,888
Well that's why our that's why our interview cuz Joe hadn't watched

2232
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,264
That was such a

2233
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,336
Move on Alex's part of just like

2234
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:42,176
I lie about all the time

2235
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,456
There's another interview

2236
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:49,856
It does contain all of the information then even I don't even know that I always

2237
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:53,952
What I want to make this point

2238
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,744
It's moving the goalposts entirely

2239
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,072
When you realize that you're f****** argument doesn't staying everytime

2240
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,608
Every f****** time

2241
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,144
And because he's able to

2242
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,680
Because Joanne

2243
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,960
NPR interview

2244
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
And because

2245
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,520
Have the f****** time

2246
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:11,616
Do this stuff looking into this.

2247
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,408
He ends up having to

2248
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:16,224
Stipulate Alex's conjecture

2249
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:20,320
Or whatever he has to at least allow it to be like I don't know

2250
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Right

2251
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,648
Say I don't know and then Alex

2252
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,464
He has to see the point to him to some extent

2253
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:27,744
And Alex

2254
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,048
Interpretation

2255
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:32,096
That's enough

2256
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,120
Thing for Alex

2257
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:33,888
Text effect

2258
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:38,752
Because he would never say that on his own show

2259
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,544
Going to be like it's open to interpretation

2260
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,824
That's pathetic

2261
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,920
More about Soros and

2262
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,944
A claim about him

2263
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,224
That he's never made

2264
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:48,992
Before

2265
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:49,760
And is

2266
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:52,320
Cockamamie bulshit he's actually a dog

2267
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:56,416
George Soros

2268
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,024
George

2269
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:04,096
George Soros

2270
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,376
Tried to crash the pound

2271
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:07,936
The pound

2272
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:13,056
So the pound stuff is fine we'll talk about that a little bit

2273
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:19,712
The stone

2274
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,736
Governments all the time

2275
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,504
Which is just

2276
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
Him trying to

2277
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,320
Help democratizing forces in

2278
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,600
Soviet Bloc countries

2279
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:26,880
Roots Cafe

2280
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,928
Add Nas

2281
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:32,256
But he's never I've never I'm not going to say he's never said it

2282
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:35,072
Because I don't know but I've never heard him say the George Soros

2283
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:37,376
Rams the breakup of the Soviet Union

2284
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:40,960
And I'm here to say that if he did he should be Alex's

2285
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:41,728
Hero

2286
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,032
Alex hates the buckets

2287
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:47,872
They are guys of the antique

2288
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,408
Communist propaganda

2289
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
Hero worship

2290
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:54,528
Rose quarterback

2291
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,320
In Alex's World shoot

2292
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,416
It's crazy

2293
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,184
What a f******

2294
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,792
That's a great question

2295
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,328
That is not

2296
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:14,240
Who's like

2297
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:17,824
That Reagan speech by Tear Down the Walls

2298
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
Talking about

2299
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,640
It's nonsense

2300
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,944
Diculous so like I said

2301
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,248
We're going to get to this this question

2302
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,528
About breaking

2303
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:29,344
I think we talked about it a little bit

2304
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,880
Before but there's a little bit of clarification

2305
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,416
Location that might be useful

2306
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,696
And this is really funny

2307
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,488
Because this is one of the only

2308
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,536
I think it might be the only incident

2309
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,328
Where Jamie look something up

2310
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:44,704
Did Alex is talking about

2311
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,288
Rogan reads it on air

2312
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,848
Wow he's doing it to just read

2313
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:54,432
Get a derailleur

2314
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,088
Against

2315
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:09,792
George Soros

2316
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,840
If highest level ditch day

2317
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:17,216
He is the manager or was the manager are you shooting again

2318
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
But how do you know if you remember research

2319
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,944
Marshall Dyer

2320
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,528
Did George Soros break the bank of England little bigger please

2321
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:37,184
In Britain black Wednesday September 16th

2322
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:37,952
Break it

2323
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:44,352
But they force the British government from the European exchange rate mechanism joining the ERM card

2324
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:49,472
Grown-up please

2325
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:55,872
Although stood apart from the European currencies the British pound blah blah blah compounding the underlying problems inherent in the pounds include

2326
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:59,712
I'm not seeing this where's the park with George Soros Douglas

2327
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:06,368
I'm just trying to find it

2328
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:12,768
Interest rates to teens

2329
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:14,560
Shorting the currency

2330
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:20,960
British government gave in with Drew traderma

2331
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:25,312
Although was a Biddle

2332
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:31,712
Bitter pill to swallow the pound came back stronger because the excess interest in high inflation

2333
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:39,904
Searles pocketed

2334
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
Dollars on the deal

2335
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,768
And cemented his reputation as the premier currency Speculator in the world

2336
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:52,448
If your currency speculators know what you do though I don't know what

2337
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:57,568
George Soros

2338
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:06,784
So you just moves on today

2339
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,088
But that are important

2340
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,136
She was didn't crash the pound

2341
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:11,904
At all

2342
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
You profited off it

2343
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,000
Because he was shorting the pound

2344
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:18,816
And the reason he was shorting the pound is because of that

2345
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,352
European exchange rate

2346
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:24,960
Mechanism when the pound got into a deer resistant

2347
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:25,728
Get intuitive

2348
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,520
Begin with but when they did

2349
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:31,104
Huge mistake in terms of tying it to

2350
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,128
The German mark

2351
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:36,224
BRB amount

2352
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,760
The exchange rate

2353
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,784
Nailed it

2354
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,576
Was something that was unsustainable

2355
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:45,184
Yeah and it had to stay within a certain range above or below

2356
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,464
That exchange rate

2357
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,512
And because of the inflation rate

2358
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:52,096
And the interest rates in the United Kingdom at the time

2359
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,888
It was just impossible for them

2360
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:56,704
Keep that up

2361
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,984
He wasn't the only one

2362
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:04,128
Just the one that made the biggest Bet On It were able to recognize the signs

2363
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
The place for anyone to see

2364
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,456
That they were about to

2365
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,736
To have to default on

2366
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
That was going to cause the p

2367
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:11,808
To go down

2368
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,624
And if you were able to

2369
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,904
See what was coming

2370
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,184
Did You Bet On It

2371
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,976
You would make a lot of money

2372
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:25,376
Doris looked was like that's a bad idea and then bet a s*** ton of money that it was a bad idea

2373
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:28,192
He had some concerns about if it will made him end up making

2374
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:31,264
The big bet that ended up winning him a billion dollars

2375
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:37,664
In all of this

2376
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
Billion dollars off

2377
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:45,088
Regulate speculations that articles to come back much

2378
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:46,880
Stronger because of the

2379
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,416
The crashed it was terrible

2380
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,208
In the immediate but it was

2381
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,000
Better in the long run

2382
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,304
But the issue is

2383
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,864
Was acting on

2384
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,144
A report that

2385
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,680
If you get heard up from

2386
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,240
The head of the German Central Bank

2387
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,520
You'd given an interview

2388
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,824
And he was talking about how some

2389
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,592
Even if

2390
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:08,128
Some

2391
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,200
Currencies would have to be

2392
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:11,968
Devalued

2393
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,760
Essentially because of

2394
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:17,088
What was going on

2395
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,112
The prevailing

2396
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,672
Standard of the

2397
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:26,816
Strawberry

2398
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,352
And so the idea

2399
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,632
The president of

2400
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:32,448
German Central Bank was coming out of those things

2401
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,472
Throws is like

2402
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:35,264
If we're going to move we gotta move to

2403
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,568
Today we're going to bed

2404
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
Life

2405
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:41,920
So much more signs here

2406
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,712
So he

2407
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,992
And his his boys

2408
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,784
Made a massive bat

2409
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,552
Paid off you

2410
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:49,088
Yeah that's what it is

2411
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,368
Break the bank

2412
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,440
The back did it to themselves

2413
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,744
He had nothing to do with getting into

2414
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,512
Erm

2415
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,280
He had nothing

2416
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:00,096
Things to do with the rate that they ended up nailing the

2417
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:02,144
The pound to as it relates to

2418
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,424
There's nothing

2419
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:06,240
Thing that he's responsible for in this other than

2420
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:12,896
Yeah capitalist speculation

2421
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:20,320
The perfect job

2422
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,112
There's a lot more little detail

2423
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,928
But he's just blaming Soros

2424
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
4 thing

2425
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,464
They

2426
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
He has enough

2427
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,584
Explain it in the morgue

2428
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,168
Detailed and complicated way but it does seem like the basic story is

2429
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:37,728
The British government did a bad thing

2430
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,944
Stupid yeah yeah

2431
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,968
Entirely stupid

2432
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:48,736
The time it's

2433
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,040
Maybe foolish and short-sighted

2434
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:54,368
But it was in response to financial troubles that

2435
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Pound was in

2436
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:58,208
When they decided it wasn't

2437
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,744
The decision that was taken lightly

2438
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,792
State resisted getting involved

2439
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,560
For a long time

2440
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,888
Right

2441
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,448
I'm being in the ER and the exchange

2442
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,776
What's something that would help stabilize the economy

2443
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,312
So they chose to do that

2444
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,080
We're foolish

2445
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:17,408
In terms of the rate

2446
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,432
Songs like

2447
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,200
Got it

2448
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,248
Bet all the money

2449
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,528
Are they made a billion dollars

2450
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,344
Pretty

2451
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,136
In retrospect

2452
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:32,000
I imagined Soros

2453
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:34,560
Absolutely on the Vanguard

2454
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:36,096
So many other people were like

2455
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:42,240
This is a great idea and we're going to work it out

2456
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,544
Because the ways East

2457
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,336
Speculatory

2458
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:48,384
You're borrowing a ton of money

2459
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,432
To make the bat right

2460
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,712
You know and if if

2461
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,504
You're wrong in the pound goes up

2462
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:57,088
You have just now borrowed a ton of money and lost everything

2463
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,368
You have to pay that money back

2464
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,440
Relatively speaking of

2465
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:04,512
Is probably a good probably wasn't

2466
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:06,304
It probably wasn't that scary

2467
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,328
Because

2468
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,656
It's one of those things where even if the pound does go up

2469
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,960
It is definitely not going to go up

2470
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:15,264
By as much as the pound eventually went down

2471
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:19,616
You know I'm saying Shirley 20 million dollars

2472
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,920
At the risk of making a billion-dollar

2473
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:29,600
You're playing is variables and right

2474
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:31,136
Felt like if something

2475
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,416
Epsom salt

2476
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:33,952
World

2477
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,000
The British economy

2478
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,024
British

2479
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,608
Replacing all of that was able to

2480
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,888
Like they were able to

2481
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,168
Make it work

2482
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:46,752
Erm

2483
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,544
Yeah I'm and it went up

2484
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,848
He would have stood to lose

2485
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:55,968
So much more that are not very high

2486
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:57,760
But if it went bad

2487
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:04,928
You wouldn't be George Soros possibility did exist

2488
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:09,280
This goes to history of reflux

2489
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,328
The idea that you have to

2490
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:13,120
Be flexible within Market

2491
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:15,936
We have to see what's going on and act accordingly

2492
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:17,728
This giant Bethany

2493
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
An act of his

2494
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:20,544
Reflexivity

2495
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
Principles

2496
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,592
In practice

2497
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,128
Because the idea was weak

2498
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,664
At like 10 million dollars

2499
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
Or whatever

2500
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,736
And that's one way to do it

2501
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:30,528
But reflexivity would tell you

2502
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:33,600
This is an opportunity where you can make a billion

2503
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:38,208
Right why not do that Ocean's 11

2504
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:39,232
You're going to lose

2505
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:43,840
To the house but if you make a big bet by the window is only open it

2506
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:45,888
But now

2507
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,912
So whatever

2508
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,192
I do believe that there is

2509
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,472
Ethical conversations

2510
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,520
You can have about that but they're not with Alex's

2511
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,080
He has nothing you have no f****** idea what he's talkin

2512
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:55,360
About you just wants to

2513
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,384
To demonize this guy be

2514
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,712
And supports liberal democracy

2515
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,736
Forces

2516
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:03,040
In countries that he wishes were still part of the sofa

2517
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,320
Union I guess

2518
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:06,112
Or in America

2519
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:09,952
Yeah I told you when it is that you think he has it's a bad idea

2520
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,256
I told you this a rogue variable

2521
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,048
Annual correctly guess what it is

2522
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:20,448
Eddie Bravo Bravo because I can't

2523
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:24,288
Schedule to do an episode after Alex

2524
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,128
Have you showed up early

2525
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:28,896
Embarrassed because

2526
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:33,248
Aleve somebody dumber than him

2527
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,296
He needs to have an elevated status

2528
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,064
Over somebody

2529
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,600
He can't have that with Joe

2530
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:44,256
And also Joe realize this isn't going all that well if I get in here will at least have a third wheel

2531
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:48,608
It's everyone's problem

2532
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:53,728
Might be a part of why the episode

2533
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:54,752
5 hours long

2534
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,544
Because they just decided

2535
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,592
Keep calling but here is Eddie's in

2536
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
Introduction

2537
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:01,408
To the episode Alex gets

2538
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:04,224
Oh my God any problems here

2539
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,016
Jesus Christ

2540
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:10,368
Great

2541
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:21,120
So he

2542
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,656
Alex is wearing a

2543
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:25,984
Part of it was to troll

2544
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:30,592
Either flat-earth guide

2545
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:33,152
It's complicated

2546
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:34,944
So I think he was trying to f*** with Eddie

2547
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,736
By wearing the shirt

2548
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:38,784
And Eddy

2549
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,856
You son of a good workout

2550
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:45,440
T-shirt

2551
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:49,792
No no please don't

2552
02:12:54,656 --> 02:13:00,800
Skillet

2553
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:05,920
This which is why I don't want to do it tell me

2554
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:11,808
So this goes on for a while

2555
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,368
Is a sad display of a drunk a*******

2556
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,160
So

2557
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:20,000
Eddie shows up story about being like

2558
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,280
I guess maybe he worked at the

2559
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:23,584
Strip club

2560
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,120
It's irrelevant

2561
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:26,912
It was a flat strip club

2562
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,984
The guy who ran the place was like

2563
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,264
If this little lady

2564
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,800
You can choke me out then I'll give her

2565
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:34,080
Are the keys to my car

2566
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:40,224
And it's young guy small woman who Eddie had taught how to do a chokehold

2567
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:40,992
The guy out

2568
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,552
He passed out hit his head on the ground as soon as

2569
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:45,088
Brownie

2570
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
He was Furious

2571
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
Got to give her those keys

2572
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:53,792
That's fine story

2573
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:00,960
Sick mask what is the same time in the realm of Joe Rogan show

2574
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:05,568
It's a fine story told well

2575
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,920
Suspense

2576
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:10,944
Fair

2577
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,016
So whatever

2578
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:16,320
Amanda Alex tells this story

2579
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:18,112
I think he's trying to build on

2580
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:20,928
And be like art

2581
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:22,464
Deeply Disturbed

2582
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:29,120
I don't think I've ever been choked completely out

2583
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,656
Super hot chick

2584
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:35,264
Tied up

2585
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:40,128
Have sex with you

2586
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,408
Is it true story

2587
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:53,696
And she's super hot

2588
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:59,072
Relationship like 30 year old boyfriend

2589
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:03,680
Show me the parking lot

2590
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:04,704
Oh my God

2591
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,496
Yeah oh my God

2592
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:08,800
So that's the guy probably

2593
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,568
Nicola killed

2594
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:12,896
No no no no

2595
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:13,664
Dude

2596
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:18,016
Hey Jason

2597
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,856
Community in France

2598
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:23,392
People in particular probably

2599
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:29,792
Maybe from abuse

2600
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:34,144
Who he was sexually active with who forced him into cross-dressing

2601
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,168
At a young age

2602
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:37,216
Requirement to have sex

2603
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:40,032
With her if the story is true at all

2604
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:44,896
Tails are weird

2605
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:46,432
There is

2606
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:52,832
No problem with that among two consensual adults yes yes

2607
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:59,232
Nono twelve-year-old experimenting with makeup or any of that stuff is Noble

2608
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:05,632
Big deal that's another piece of this another piece of that she is also a victim

2609
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:10,240
Girls f****** a twelve-year-old and a thirty-year-old sign

2610
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:12,288
She's got range

2611
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:14,080
Difficult

2612
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:20,480
No but I mean you're describing here not you but if you really take all the packaging off

2613
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:24,320
F***** in the choked out

2614
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,088
Kind of stopped

2615
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:25,856
How does a

2616
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:29,184
You're describing Alex Jones as a 1213

2617
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,208
Danger old child

2618
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:31,744
Being in a

2619
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,024
Super chaotic and

2620
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,328
Like to the point where Justin

2621
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:37,632
Existing in that space like I said

2622
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:38,656
Story told

2623
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:39,424
Just

2624
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,960
Existing in a space

2625
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:43,008
Where you're at

2626
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:48,128
With a seventeen-year-old girl who is being abused by a thirty-year-old boyfriend

2627
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:50,944
In the context of a quote-unquote relationship

2628
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,992
That is enough

2629
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:55,040
Really have a lasting impression

2630
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:58,112
That's terrifying to a child

2631
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:58,880
That

2632
02:16:59,136 --> 02:16:59,648
Control

2633
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:01,440
And in blackest debility

2634
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:03,232
Lack of any kind of

2635
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,256
Real

2636
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:08,352
What you need in your formative years

2637
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,120
It's great

2638
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,400
Took to come to Ethel

2639
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,424
Adulthood

2640
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,448
Is absinthe

2641
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,008
He's saying that this is a girl whose parent

2642
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,032
We're never home

2643
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,056
So she was f******

2644
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:17,824
30 Euro

2645
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:20,640
And then she acted out on me as well

2646
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:22,176
Like There's No Parental soup

2647
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:22,944
Supervision around

2648
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,736
There's profound abuse happen

2649
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,272
It's just like

2650
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:28,320
Thank you take everything

2651
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,856
You take everything out of in your life

2652
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:31,136
Like what you're left with is like

2653
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:36,512
This should be a story for therapy not laughed on Rome Show

2654
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:38,560
A combination of a lot of

2655
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,840
Like f*****-up things like

2656
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,888
But the worst part is

2657
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:44,960
Is the way that this story is being told as if

2658
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:46,752
Putting makeup on

2659
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:47,520
Is

2660
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:48,544
First off geisha

2661
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:50,592
Yourself

2662
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,176
This story is being told like

2663
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,200
Like how

2664
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,808
Whenever a

2665
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,856
Adult male teacher

2666
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:04,672
Has sex with one of his students everybody like this

2667
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:09,792
F***** up right but whatever I had sex with one of her students were like

2668
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:15,680
Given that

2669
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:18,240
And you're like no no it doesn't

2670
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:19,008
Bissell

2671
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:19,776
F***** up

2672
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:22,336
It's people's brain

2673
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:25,408
Yeah

2674
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,968
To some extent

2675
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,760
Alex has the right

2676
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,552
To tell the story however he wants to

2677
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:32,320
Cuz it is expiry

2678
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:34,624
You know what I'm saying

2679
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,416
I don't think that you know

2680
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,696
We need to

2681
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:43,072
I don't know it's such a weird line like because what he's doing is normalizing all of these

2682
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:46,912
Which is bad

2683
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:49,216
But at the same time if that like

2684
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,240
I don't believe this is a

2685
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,264
But if

2686
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,544
In the context of

2687
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,336
His lifelong therapy

2688
02:18:54,592 --> 02:19:00,736
He's come to peace with these experiences that he has

2689
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:03,040
About it and be like in this crazy

2690
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,832
I don't think that's bad

2691
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:09,952
Are response

2692
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,000
Rogan and Bravo

2693
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,280
To both be like

2694
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:15,072
Hahaha this is funny

2695
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:18,912
Like there's no way that anybody could tell me that story and I wouldn't be like

2696
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,192
That's

2697
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:22,496
You need to deal with that

2698
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
You need to

2699
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,800
Deal with that in a

2700
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:27,872
Much better way than telling me the story like it's a joke

2701
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,664
Cuz that's f***** up

2702
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,432
SMS

2703
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:34,016
Wow irresponsible friends or

2704
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,040
Accomplices

2705
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:35,808
Yeah

2706
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:36,832
Enabler

2707
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:40,160
For sure

2708
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,696
Everything that happened on the show

2709
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:43,232
And I staszak

2710
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:47,328
Like in the same way like when you buy an album when you're a kid

2711
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:49,632
And your favorite song on it is the single

2712
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:51,424
Yeah it's just not a good album

2713
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:03,200
Why did anybody

2714
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:05,760
Express

2715
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:07,808
Whatever is that sort of thing

2716
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:09,600
You get the album like f*** this

2717
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:14,208
That's kind of how I feel about this this is the single and I think this is one of the clips that

2718
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,232
Probably going to be

2719
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:18,048
Gift around and go big

2720
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:19,328
And what it is

2721
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,608
Is Eddie Bravo

2722
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,400
Trolling Alex

2723
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,680
Really hard

2724
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:25,216
And it's hilarious

2725
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:26,240
Level

2726
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:35,712
The studio

2727
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:36,736
Italics

2728
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:37,760
Freaks out

2729
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:57,216
Do you really think

2730
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:02,848
People out there campaigning for late-term abortions

2731
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:18,208
To give a little bit of context

2732
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:20,768
The reason that idea scrolling him like this

2733
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:27,168
Is because Alex does that about Eddie's flatters belief

2734
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:33,824
Actually believes

2735
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,920
Is there's a flat or like that stuff

2736
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
Just to f*** with him

2737
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:41,504
And Alex is losing

2738
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,944
Okay

2739
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:23,744
Play Maddie

2740
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:30,144
Plainview we went into a long

2741
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:35,520
Conversation

2742
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:40,640
First off

2743
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,968
If you allow yourself to get f***** with by Eddie Bravo

2744
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:50,368
It's not even human.

2745
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:57,792
There's a delightful on some levels

2746
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:04,192
In much the same way when I was

2747
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:10,336
Stop the guy in the crowd like I don't know if that

2748
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:14,176
Same way listening to this I don't know if Alex is Anguirus

2749
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:18,016
Performative yeah if you watch it you see his face he does look

2750
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:20,320
Not like he's playing

2751
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:24,928
Yeah a little bit

2752
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:26,720
All of his outburst

2753
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:28,256
Emotional

2754
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:29,024
Like this doesn't

2755
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:30,560
That's not you

2756
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:35,680
I don't really care

2757
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:36,960
Clearly f****** with him

2758
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:46,432
30-second Alex I was f****** with you

2759
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,272
Daily fix

2760
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:53,344
It's bad that Alex got f***** with by Eddie Bravo

2761
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:57,696
That's pretty sad the worst part though is Eddie Bravo going

2762
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:59,232
Of course I believe that

2763
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:02,304
You didn't even have to do that for

2764
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,352
You could have just said you were f******

2765
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:13,824
More about this about

2766
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:14,848
The house

2767
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:17,664
The governor Virginia's Brothers t-shirt

2768
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
Just of course I believe you

2769
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:25,088
Organ harvesting doctor

2770
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:26,624
That's just

2771
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:29,696
Yeah

2772
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:30,720
But

2773
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:32,000
This is

2774
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:32,768
What happened

2775
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:33,536
And how he was on

2776
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:34,304
Blackmail

2777
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:41,216
Organ harvesting

2778
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:58,112
Kkkk

2779
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:07,072
Oregon

2780
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:07,840
That's a good

2781
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:14,240
Conspiracy

2782
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:23,456
I'm so happy

2783
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:28,320
So you shouldn't tell just married

2784
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,600
Has created

2785
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:31,136
Completely different environment

2786
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:32,672
Even if like

2787
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:34,720

02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,584
They threw out the rest of it

2791
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:45,216
It becomes much more palatable feel like everyone has

2792
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:49,568
A position that they can work with Eddie Bravo is there

2793
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:56,224
The steaks are gone but you don't have to talk about this

2794
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:06,464
Sandy Hook have a shutdown Showdown

2795
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:11,584
Also I would say that Alex another reason besides the fact

2796
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,632
You're forced to f*** sheep and give guys jobs

2797
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:15,424
No reason you didn't join a fraternity

2798
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,824
If you went to a junior college if I dropped out

2799
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,664
But that's just my take on it you know

2800
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,712
So

2801
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:28,736
Eddie is there

2802
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:29,760
Alex wants to

2803
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:30,528
Impress him

2804
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:31,296
I am Joe

2805
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,856
Start talking about

2806
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,392
Course

2807
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:37,440
It's some point Alex talks about the Piazza

2808
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:41,024
Really long thing that he goes on about how you used to have like a bunch of box

2809
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,048
Garage

2810
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:48,448
And even know what was in them and then one of his family is going through and they found like a Nazi

2811
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:54,848
Metal he bought at a garage sale or something like that and they're like oh my God

2812
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,384
That's a family issue

2813
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:03,040
Family member if your family member found a Nazi metal you're not able to have that conversation

2814
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:04,064
That's on you

2815
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:05,856
That's on you and your family

2816
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:08,672
I don't think that you have any Nazi metal makes you a Nazi

2817
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:11,232
I understand people who have like historical

2818
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:13,792
Interest in that sort of

2819
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:20,704
Possibility of that

2820
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:21,472
Into World War

2821
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,824
Antiques their relics

2822
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,104
Holding those things

2823
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,896
As long as you own

2824
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:31,200
American sings also

2825
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:34,016
Or you know the Allied Powers I guess

2826
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:36,064
As long as you have a spectrum

2827
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:37,344
Of these antiques

2828
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:38,624
And not just

2829
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:40,160
Please.

2830
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:44,256
Very normal describing is

2831
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:45,280
More like

2832
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,840
How he has no idea what humor is

2833
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,400
Like there's no way they

2834
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,424
Cuz if you

2835
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,960
Because if you did find that

2836
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:55,264
Not to meddle you wouldn't think that he was in

2837
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:58,848
What you were saying

2838
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:05,248
Probably because he's running joke

2839
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:08,064
Would definitely be something that you start throwing in there where you like

2840
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:11,904
Oh yeah because I met

2841
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:17,792
But that's just how people respond

2842
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:23,936
It's whatever but

2843
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,216
Besides

2844
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:27,520
Dirt

2845
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:32,384
Oh

2846
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,664
Your secrets

2847
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:38,528
What are the dishes

2848
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:40,832
Who's telling you the stuff

2849
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:44,416
Beyond classified Eddie

2850
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:51,072
Do I mean

2851
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:55,680
You work for a dinner of indoor air conditioning

2852
02:28:55,936 --> 02:29:01,056
What about dinner

2853
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,848
Housing Authority

2854
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:16,928
There's a huge Park

2855
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:25,376
But the point is is that

2856
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:29,216
Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine

2857
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:31,776
That did that

2858
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:39,200
Stop like they've been very clear about their Man of the Year. Reflected leaving Port them

2859
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:43,040
Unfortunate

2860
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:45,600
Hitler was on the cover of time

2861
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:47,904
Does not mean that they were like

2862
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:49,952
There's a conversation to be had about how the

2863
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,720
Like the buns and

2864
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,512
Stuff like that there were tons of America

2865
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,280
Nazis

2866
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,304
Lot of business

2867
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:55,072
Centrist

2868
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,352
In favor of

2869
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:05,568
Now you can go back and read a lot of probe killing all the Jews

2870
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:06,592
Greens are really shity

2871
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:07,872
That's what

2872
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:08,640
Comes up with

2873
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:10,944
Because he doesn't want to talk about his grandfather

2874
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,760
He wants to introduce the idea that his grandfather gave

2875
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:17,344
Secret information was a German living in Dallas

2876
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,648
He also killed

2877
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,232
I don't remember when

2878
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,024
Nope

2879
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,792
I don't want to get

2880
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:28,352
I don't want to

2881
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:29,888
Eddie

2882
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:30,656
F***** me on

2883
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:32,192
When I was going to tell some

2884
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:35,264
Straight up a male Authority

2885
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,288
Grandfather

2886
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,056
But

2887
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,080
Alex regroup

2888
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:39,872
Who is grandfather

2889
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:42,432
And I don't know if this is what he intended to say

2890
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,480
But this is where the story goes

2891
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:48,064
Xbox.com

2892
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:52,672
Because he worked for this guy that was a refrigeration air conditioning

2893
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:56,512
Recycle your dad all the car dealerships in Dallas

2894
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,328
And what did they tell you

2895
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:12,128
Your grandfather is little

2896
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:16,992
Braun

2897
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:19,040
What

2898
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:23,904
Army Warner von Braun

2899
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:31,840
I get it now

2900
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:40,544
Is f****** brigan fire if there's a hero once again

2901
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:44,384
Distantly

2902
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:50,528
That's good timing on 80th part like

2903
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,344
That's actually being funny

2904
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,112
Now I get why you

2905
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:03,072
Jesus a new Wernher von Braun

2906
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,608
Great

2907
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:05,888
I guess

2908
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,424
I don't know if that's

2909
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,192
Truewerk

2910
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,472
Courtside

2911
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:11,520
If we allow it to be the truth

2912
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:13,568
It makes this next clip

2913
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:19,200
This is eclipse

2914
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:20,480
I'll let that slide

2915
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:21,504
You say something like

2916
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,040
I got question

2917
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,208
Uber mention

2918
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:34,816
Oh shut okay

2919
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:45,568
Dude if you want to be clear about this

2920
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:49,408
Alex is up here on Rogan show straight up saying that his family was recognized

2921
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:50,944
As part of the master race

2922
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:56,832
I don't think I need to take any more time out anyone today to explain why that's f***** up

2923
02:32:57,344 --> 02:33:00,416
Because uberman she's like it doesn't that's a Nietzsche

2924
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:06,816
What after he'd pass

2925
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:09,376
About the timeline

2926
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:11,168
But his sister was involved

2927
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:13,216
The term because she was

2928
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:18,848
Nazi sympathizer

2929
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:23,456
Clean off the idea that refers to the area

2930
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,480
Which

2931
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:27,552
You are reinforcing your belief

2932
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:28,320
In

2933
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:29,600
Whilst telling

2934
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:33,184
The story your family is exact

2935
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,352
Which is like

2936
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:41,376
You mean they were not

2937
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:43,424
Cuz it sounds like

2938
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:50,080
It does really sound like that

2939
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:51,616
Alex

2940
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:52,384
Alex

2941
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:54,176
Grandfather's

2942
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:56,224
Were those Metals you had a box

2943
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:58,784
Your grandfather's War medallions

2944
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:00,320
F****** know but you don't

2945
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:02,112
You if you are somebody who's like

2946
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:05,184
I f****** hate Nazis they're terrible

2947
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:08,512
You don't get drunk on a

2948
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:20,800
They only talk to other people in the club the master race

2949
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:21,568
Nothing

2950
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:29,248
It's what I heard him say We are family is

2951
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:30,784
Uber mention I was like

2952
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:32,576
Oh God

2953
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,624
You know who doesn't say that

2954
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:36,928
The family

2955
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:46,400
G with a very small

2956
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,216
No it says

2957
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:50,496
Venn diagrams

2958
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:52,544
The wrong way to look at it

2959
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,360
What's the tiniest sliver that is just Alex

2960
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:05,344
Their families were also Uber mention

2961
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:07,904
It's fun to be part of the master race

2962
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:11,488
Cuz you really don't have to deal with reality

2963
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:16,608
Sure

2964
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:23,008
In his next life we get another glimpse so earlier I was talking about when he was seven or so and he heard his dad talking to

2965
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,288
About making to cyborg

2966
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,824
And that's cool

2967
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,152
Apparently

2968
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:31,200
So we hear about his grandfather

2969
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:34,016
Don't know if it's

2970
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:35,552
We're not entirely sure

2971
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:39,648
Okay he doesn't say the last name so I'm not sure like

2972
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,928
I would assume his mom

2973
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,720
Father's last name

2974
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:43,488
Ruby Hammond

2975
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:47,840
Cuz her name is Carol his dad father's last name would be Bowie

2976
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,888
No no

2977
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:50,656
Jones

2978
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:55,520
Which is David Bowie's real name

2979
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:01,152
He overhears his grandfather talking about some

2980
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:02,432
Stopped when he was a child

2981
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:03,456
And now he related

2982
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,224
280

2983
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:16,768
Scrabble

2984
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,064
So I mean be how tangentially

2985
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,344
He's jumping around from topic

2986
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:16,672
Atopic

2987
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:17,696
No stop

2988
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:20,512
There isn't a real point to it doesn't really have any

2989
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:25,632
The only think the point to the story's just revealed that his grandfather was a Nazi

2990
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:29,216
And so now he has to rewrite that to make it sound like his grandfather wasn't

2991
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:32,544
He also talks about

2992
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,336
His grandfather worked for

2993
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:37,408
Extorted by the Nazis

2994
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,944
Like something like that

2995
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,504
He tells a really long story

2996
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,040
It's very convoluted about like

2997
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,832
The grandfather

2998
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:51,488
Is this guy that you work for had to send tons of money to the Nazis share

2999
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,632
Something along those lines kind of like informing

3000
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:58,656
What Vic

3001
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:01,984
Like what conversation Alex is trying to

3002
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,008
But because it doesn't

3003
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:04,032
Make a lot of sense

3004
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:05,824
Was that like

3005
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,616
The Nazis extorted

3006
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:10,688
Like I don't know if that's the secret of Hitler

3007
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:15,040
I don't know if

3008
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:19,392
The beginning of this conversation

3009
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,672
Information about Hitler

3010
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:21,952
It turns out that he

3011
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:25,024
Blackmailed and HV AC guy

3012
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:27,328
8 HP AC HVAC

3013
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:28,864
Yeah

3014
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,888
Not a bad strategy

3015
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:34,240
Make a little.

3016
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:40,640
Certainly is well within their repertoire

3017
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:41,664
Time.

3018
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:44,480
Indoor air conditioning was

3019
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:49,088
Outdoor air conditioner

3020
02:38:58,304 --> 02:39:00,096
Sure that's what about what about

3021
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:01,632
That's

3022
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:06,496
There's a distinction

3023
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:12,384
But is not a worthwhile to fix it guys

3024
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:14,944
Guys crazy

3025
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:18,528
So earlier we heard Alex say that NASA was the real devil

3026
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:20,576
You bought

3027
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:21,856
They were the shadow

3028
02:39:22,368 --> 02:39:24,160
Shadow equals real

3029
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,720
The real

3030
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,256
Do that

3031
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,280
I really don't think we do

3032
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,448
IFixit Knuckles is there anyway

3033
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:40,288
How it is next clip Alex doubles down on that and then explain

3034
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:41,312
How that came

3035
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,104
Because Rogan is

3036
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:56,416
Government government

3037
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:08,448
It was British run

3038
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:17,920
They said we've got all this on the drawing board

3039
02:40:27,648 --> 02:40:28,672
What's the German

3040
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:35,072
Never really used to be a cult

3041
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:41,216
Thank Patty

3042
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:45,312
Because we now bring in foreign governments there's like government

3043
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:51,712
Germany's government as well

3044
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:52,736
That will be

3045
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:56,320
EU is a plan put together by the German Breakaway

3046
02:40:56,576 --> 02:41:02,720
Secret program contacted aliens

3047
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:07,584
They were the ones who came up with the

3048
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,984
He just described the globalist plan then he attributed to the billionaire conference

3049
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,032
There's only had that conference to talk about it be

3050
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:18,336
Because they were aware and we're getting information

3051
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:20,384
From these Germans or maybe not germs

3052
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,408
Tours in contact with a

3053
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:25,248
Right

3054
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:31,648
I would assume so it does make sense

3055
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:35,744
Germans are aliens

3056
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:38,304
And they're getting pissed

3057
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:39,584
Nation from them

3058
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:42,912
Is that like what we have here is out

3059
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:43,680
Presented

3060
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:45,472
A dichotomy of to Breakaway

3061
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,496
That's one is the British

3062
02:41:46,752 --> 02:41:47,264
And one is the

3063
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:51,104
The German and they're at war with each other to some extent

3064
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:51,872
No but that's

3065
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:54,944
The German secret space program or whatever

3066
02:41:55,200 --> 02:42:01,344
He's protecting Americans

3067
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,624
He's also presenting

3068
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,648
Bebe

3069
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:08,512
British Breakaway government as being involved in our government as well

3070
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:10,816
If the two were at War be in congruous 4A

3071
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:11,584
To have both

3072
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:13,120
Existing within the

3073
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:13,888
The same body

3074
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,424
But he doesn't really

3075
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,704
Sweat the small stuff

3076
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,496
Here is the other things that I think

3077
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:19,264
Everybody's

3078
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:21,312
And I would say even out

3079
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:23,360
King George

3080
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,152
Immortal

3081
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:27,200
Okay and the scenes

3082
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:27,968
Of the British got

3083
02:42:28,736 --> 02:42:30,784
Everything else is a f******

3084
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:31,808
Clock

3085
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:36,160
Sleight of hand

3086
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:38,464
Still alive you're serious

3087
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:45,376
Alex is missing ever

3088
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:47,168
One is missing and your theory is

3089
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:48,192
Thing is citation

3090
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:56,384
Missy underlying proof other than I heard a weirdo

3091
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:01,248
That's not good

3092
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:03,808
But that is not good

3093
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:06,624
Microsoft Encarta

3094
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:09,696
Another problem is

3095
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:12,000
It's one is the British one is the German

3096
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:13,792
The Germans influence

3097
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:16,864
Are NASA through the Operation Paperclip

3098
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:19,424
And all the Nazis coming over in

3099
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,216
Right

3100
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:22,752
It also makes it

3101
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:24,032
Difficult for me to

3102
02:43:24,544 --> 02:43:25,312
Integrate all of these ID

3103
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:35,296
Okay

3104
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:38,880
Okay

3105
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:48,352
You don't need to do all that

3106
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:50,656
What we're in contact with

3107
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:55,264
Are you getting this from you stating until confident

3108
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:59,360
Literature literature

3109
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:05,760
Historical books about mainstream

3110
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:31,616
Surreal definition

3111
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:40,832
Problem

3112
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:42,112
Go to statements

3113
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:48,512
Cuz they were in contact with the aliens

3114
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:54,912
IL million

3115
02:45:03,872 --> 02:45:04,384
Okay

3116
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:09,504
I'll prove it to you but I need a rebooking

3117
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:15,904
In order to do in front of Joe

3118
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:16,928
Duval of Micah

3119
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:21,280
Conjecture about

3120
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:23,072
But I will send you those

3121
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:26,400
We're going ahead of time

3122
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:27,168
Got to be great

3123
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:29,216
Those books are not going to say the

3124
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,032
This is never going to happen

3125
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,056
Although

3126
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,360
That probably that bezel problem

3127
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:36,640
Why would you mail

3128
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:44,320
Also if you have those books

3129
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:45,600
Got the little tabs

3130
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:47,392
You should know what books

3131
02:45:47,904 --> 02:45:48,416
You would think

3132
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:50,208
Especially when they are

3133
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:51,232
Pieces of

3134
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:53,792
What you think is the big truth of the

3135
02:45:54,048 --> 02:45:58,912
The world technology

3136
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:00,192
And all that stuff

3137
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:02,496
Where are you getting this from

3138
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:04,287
If you can only say

3139
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,567
The literature

3140
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:07,615
You don't know what you're talkin about

3141
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:09,919
You don't want to give that citation

3142
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:11,199
Because you know that if

3143
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:11,967
You do

3144
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:15,295
Someone to look at it be like

3145
02:46:15,807 --> 02:46:19,391
This is a nonsense book this is a Project Camelot book

3146
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:20,927
Of the idea

3147
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:22,719
Fat

3148
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:23,743
German

3149
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:26,047
Came to

3150
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:27,071
Eisenhower

3151
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:28,095
And we'll like

3152
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:29,375
Guess what

3153
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:30,399
All our technology

3154
02:46:32,191 --> 02:46:32,703
That

3155
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:34,239
A good meat

3156
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:38,079
That's a good meeting that's a good day

3157
02:46:38,591 --> 02:46:39,871
Very boring man

3158
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:41,407
Bit of a teetotaler

3159
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:44,223
Has a meeting with some German

3160
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:50,879
Aliens are real

3161
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:56,767
The guy with the brown bag dude

3162
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:58,559
Brown Bag me up

3163
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:02,399
The part of the Project Camelot like a alien

3164
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:03,167
Narrative

3165
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:04,191
In some

3166
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:05,471
I don't know how

3167
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:06,239
Pervasive it is

3168
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:09,311
It's fairly common

3169
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:11,359
Treaty with aliens in order to allow them

3170
02:47:11,871 --> 02:47:16,991
Kidnap people for scientific purposes

3171
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:20,063
But it's also based on people actually believe

3172
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:26,719
Artful retelling of that

3173
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:29,279
Where is incorporating the Nazis come

3174
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:31,327
And being a part of that

3175
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:33,631
And maybe that's a part of people's

3176
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:34,911
Paranormal

3177
02:47:35,167 --> 02:47:35,679
Argument

3178
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:37,983
As well I don't know

3179
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:42,847
Catfish guide

3180
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:48,735
I don't know I read Hellboy years ago I thought it was

3181
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:50,527
So Alex

3182
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,831
Gets into a bit of a Jag

3183
02:47:55,647 --> 02:47:56,415
Which we know

3184
02:47:56,671 --> 02:47:59,743
Yeah yeah yeah

3185
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:03,839
The oldest misrepresentation of Carol Quigley's work there's no source of

3186
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:04,607
It's about like

3187
02:48:04,863 --> 02:48:05,375
These

3188
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,167
The globalist

3189
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:08,703
As it were or the inside

3190
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:09,727
Whichever

3191
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:11,263
Terminology the Rider 2

3192
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:13,823
They controlled all sides of

3193
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:14,591
The conflict

3194
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:17,663
Manipulated Hitler into doing what he did in order to

3195
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:20,991
Blah blee bloo

3196
02:48:21,503 --> 02:48:23,039
The saying that Sandy Hook was fake

3197
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:28,927
In this next clip Alex is talking about his beliefs

3198
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:30,719
All that Hitler setups

3199
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:33,791
His biggest piece of evidence

3200
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:35,071
Answer his biggest argument

3201
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:38,399
Is that b******* story that we've talked about a bunch of times

3202
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:39,423
Rudolf Hess

3203
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:41,983
About him flying in with a

3204
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:44,799
Peace treaty ride parachuting into England

3205
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:47,359
Scotland

3206
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:48,383
But

3207
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:49,919
Do you know all this nonsense

3208
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:50,687
About his fly

3209
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:52,479
Alex talks about this

3210
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:53,503
And then I

3211
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:55,551
I realized

3212
02:48:56,063 --> 02:48:56,575
Summit

3213
02:48:56,831 --> 02:48:57,599
Major problem

3214
02:48:57,855 --> 02:48:58,879
We've never pointed out

3215
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:00,159
With Alex's Theory

3216
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:01,183
And I'll tell you what I'm doing

3217
02:49:02,463 --> 02:49:04,511
Rudolf Hess was the

3218
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:07,583
The guy Hitler

3219
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:08,863
Just 1941

3220
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,959
Corsicana

3221
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:15,775
Who was a Nazi in German

3222
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:22,943
The French do down beachy French 75

3223
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:26,271
Here's the

3224
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:31,135
Nothing we've talked a lot about the problems of Alex's fake story about Rudolph house

3225
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:33,439
The peace treaty that would have ended World War

3226
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:35,487
Set off all that check

3227
02:49:35,743 --> 02:49:36,767
His name was Rudy

3228
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:38,559
Kind of rude

3229
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:39,327
To call him rude

3230
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:40,607
Rudy

3231
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:43,935
Nice rehash that here but I do want to point out that

3232
02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:44,703
Glaring hole

3233
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:47,775
Alex says that Rudolph has had a treaty for

3234
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:50,591
Peace that representative deal between the Germans and Edward

3235
02:49:51,615 --> 02:49:52,639
The problem with this is that

3236
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,687
Has flight for Scott

3237
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:56,735
Happened on May 10th 90

3238
02:49:56,991 --> 02:49:57,759
1841

3239
02:49:58,271 --> 02:49:59,039
And why is that a problem

3240
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:04,671
Well because Edward the 8th abdicated the throne on December 11th 1936

3241
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:07,999
P-39

3242
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:10,047
Three years after you'd step down as

3243
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:13,887
So he never would have actually been in a position to negotiate a peace

3244
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:14,911
This narrative

3245
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:17,983
Complete trashed it only works if you have no idea

3246
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:19,263
I like the basic facts

3247
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:20,799
About when things happen

3248
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:26,175
No grasp on no in your heart

3249
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:27,199
You cannot step down

3250
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:29,247
Once a king always

3251
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:30,527
No

3252
02:50:30,783 --> 02:50:36,927
Yep no cuz you wanted to marry a divorce divorce not done

3253
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:38,719
It was absolute

3254
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:42,303
Yeah abdicated the throne for that

3255
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:43,839
Couple years later WWII

3256
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:47,935
Two broke out he was in no position to charge

3257
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:49,215
He wasn't even in

3258
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:53,311
England for most of that time right because he was kind of

3259
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:54,847
A scandalous figure

3260
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:59,199
Yeah and that whole narrative like

3261
02:50:59,455 --> 02:51:00,223
And in all that stuff

3262
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:06,111
The royal families of most of Europe at that have been f****** each other for

3263
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:10,463
Forever

3264
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:14,559
We're related to each other as their royalty was related to him

3265
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:16,351
Because royalty has such a

3266
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:18,655
Delineate

3267
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:20,703
Countries borders

3268
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:24,031
So you have like Old Kingdom

3269
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,823
Stuff like that that existed

3270
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:29,919
It's all you have intermarriages of

3271
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:30,943
The kingdom of

3272
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:32,479
What part of Germany

3273
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:38,367
Holy Roman Empire

3274
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,903
Yeah you have all that stuff

3275
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:41,695
That makes it incredibly complicated

3276
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:43,999
Misrepresent

3277
02:51:44,255 --> 02:51:45,279
There's there's

3278
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:46,303
It's fertile ground

3279
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:47,583
For lying about stuff

3280
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:49,375
But the reality.

3281
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:53,727
Don't match up I just think it's hilarious but Alex

3282
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:54,495
Rudolph

3283
02:51:54,751 --> 02:51:55,775
Past would have had

3284
02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:59,103
Peace treaty signed by Edward the 8th

3285
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:00,127
That would mean

3286
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:06,527
Between

3287
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:07,295
Existed

3288
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:09,343
Before World War II

3289
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,111
Even started

3290
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:11,647
If your five-year-old

3291
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:12,415
Peace treaty that

3292
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:14,207
Predated the outbreak

3293
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:14,975
WWII

3294
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:19,839
Which makes no sense furthermore the chicken was not in control

3295
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:23,167
Right

3296
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:26,751
Talkingshit on Chamberlain he does talk some Chill Chamber

3297
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:27,519
Hey that's fine

3298
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:28,543
But

3299
02:52:29,567 --> 02:52:30,591
Because this next month is Farm

3300
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:34,175
Get that motherfuking thought so loose

3301
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:37,503
Fake

3302
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:40,319
I need to hear about aliens

3303
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:48,255
Don't take pill that cigar but I don't smoke marijuana

3304
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:49,791
Nobody is ever

3305
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:55,679
Swisher Sweets

3306
02:52:56,191 --> 02:52:56,703
Just f******

3307
02:52:58,495 --> 02:53:02,079
And you're doing the whole like

3308
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:04,383
Shittily swearing at

3309
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:06,431
Cuz you're really bad at it

3310
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:07,967
You might as well say you're getting

3311
02:53:11,039 --> 02:53:14,623
Nonsense doesn't serve any real purpose I just

3312
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:16,159
I don't know

3313
02:53:16,927 --> 02:53:19,487
And you're in La probably without your family because you're going

3314
02:53:19,743 --> 02:53:21,023
Fly back the next day or whatever

3315
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:25,375
Where would I look at it

3316
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:26,655
It's probably just bad here

3317
02:53:27,679 --> 02:53:28,447
Janoski Nike

3318
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:32,543
This is fake vodka

3319
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:34,335
No one would believe

3320
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,103
Yeah

3321
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:35,871
It's not saving

3322
02:53:36,127 --> 02:53:36,639
Face or any

3323
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:38,175
Big box just water

3324
02:53:38,687 --> 02:53:41,759
Dump it

3325
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,783
Is a stupid f******

3326
02:53:43,551 --> 02:53:44,063
Grow up

3327
02:53:44,575 --> 02:53:47,647
Joe wants to know

3328
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:49,439
When did

3329
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:50,207
The connection

3330
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:50,975
Between aliens

3331
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:51,999
Did Nazis

3332
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:55,327
Now you might think that

3333
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:58,911
You might think that's a question that Alex can answer you be wrong

3334
02:53:59,423 --> 02:54:01,471
He just decides to start rambling about other thing

3335
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:08,127
Tell me how the connection between aliens and the Nazis took place when did all the start

3336
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:14,271
At the beginning

3337
02:54:15,039 --> 02:54:16,063
It's people

3338
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:19,391
A genetically available

3339
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:25,791
To interface Native Americans incredibly diverse Universe with all these dimensions

3340
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:28,351
Where's consciousnesses

3341
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:31,935
Has no energy ever destroyed all continues on

3342
02:54:36,031 --> 02:54:37,311
Hive organism

3343
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:41,919
Race memories

3344
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:43,967
But not ingest some compressed

3345
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:46,271
Epigenetic system

3346
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:48,319
Electrochemical

3347
02:54:48,575 --> 02:54:52,927
Lower dimensions

3348
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:08,031
They're holding their breath really like my family

3349
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:19,807
Give us more XP

3350
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:22,367
The idea that ghosts

3351
02:55:22,879 --> 02:55:25,695
And they're holding you all the time right there loving us

3352
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:28,255
I don't either I also don't like most of my family

3353
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:34,655
Like not to say that I don't like my family or anything like that

3354
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:37,471
Don't like my family

3355
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:39,007
Die from serious question

3356
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:40,543
You go past them

3357
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:41,567
I don't know any of those

3358
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:44,383
People I've never met them I would like them to leave me the f*** alone

3359
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:48,223
I don't care for this idea of us being organism of

3360
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:50,271
Likelihood Vincennes in

3361
02:55:50,783 --> 02:55:51,807
Victories of our

3362
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:55,647
Our path

3363
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:56,415
Free Willy

3364
02:55:56,671 --> 02:55:57,183
Completely Nautica

3365
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:04,095
Rugged individualism

3366
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:08,191
How is individual Eva isn't even possible if you were a hive organism

3367
02:56:08,447 --> 02:56:09,983
Of everyone in the past

3368
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:11,519
Also

3369
02:56:11,775 --> 02:56:12,543
Brother

3370
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:16,639
Write to me my brother come from the exact same genetic life right

3371
02:56:17,151 --> 02:56:19,199
So you want pictures are they

3372
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:25,599
No no okay I want to go in

3373
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:31,999
Divorce situation where they have to choose or your fingertips

3374
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:40,447
But you know what I'm saying

3375
02:56:41,727 --> 02:56:44,543
Or does all of you all of your ancestors

3376
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:46,079
Depending on how many children

3377
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:48,383
And then after like five generations

3378
02:56:49,151 --> 02:56:49,663
Split 100

3379
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:50,431
Different places

3380
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:51,455
This makes no sense

3381
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:54,271
It's ludicrous. Since Metallica

3382
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:55,295
Romanticize

3383
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,575
And pretended that he

3384
02:56:56,831 --> 02:57:02,975
You proved as the idea

3385
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:03,743
Proof

3386
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:06,303
Find it or whatever it is

3387
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:07,327
It's right

3388
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:09,119
You think it's something Beyond

3389
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:10,143
Right

3390
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:10,911
Crazy

3391
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:13,983
But here's the bigger point is that we know this from listen

3392
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:16,543
Goes back to like

3393
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:17,823
Religious ideas

3394
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:20,127
Expressing

3395
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:21,151
Some sort of a Trippy

3396
02:57:21,407 --> 02:57:24,479
Far-out kind of ibf

3397
02:57:24,735 --> 02:57:26,015
The piece of his religious zealot

3398
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:28,319
Joe is allowing him to

3399
02:57:28,575 --> 02:57:29,599
Express these sorts of things

3400
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:30,623
That really

3401
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:32,159
There are fundamental

3402
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:33,439
Pieces of what makes him

3403
02:57:33,951 --> 02:57:35,231
A religious radical

3404
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:37,791
Christian Fundamentalist

3405
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:38,559
Weirdo

3406
02:57:38,815 --> 02:57:40,351
And it's just one question.

3407
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:42,655
And what else has even think

3408
02:57:43,167 --> 02:57:44,191
He just thinks it's

3409
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:47,263
He thinks they're high and they're talking about space

3410
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:49,055
He doesn't realize that

3411
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:50,079
Alex is like

3412
02:57:50,335 --> 02:57:51,871
And that's why God is

3413
02:57:52,127 --> 02:57:55,199
Controlling the world and but also there's

3414
02:57:55,455 --> 02:57:57,247
Shadow governments but it's all under God

3415
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,015
He does kind of get

3416
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:59,551
Get to that in a little bit

3417
02:57:59,807 --> 02:58:02,623
If we get another glimpse of what Alex's

3418
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:03,647
His dad has told him

3419
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:04,927
About the past

3420
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:05,951
Anakin

3421
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:06,719
And if so

3422
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:07,743
Dubious

3423
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:09,791
My dad didn't tell me this

3424
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:11,071
Dentist

3425
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:12,863
Chili sauce

3426
02:58:13,119 --> 02:58:15,423
Southside we had virtual reality goggles

3427
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:18,751
And we are eating wrong

3428
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:23,359
Something else happened and I'm not at Liberty to get into it but I was shown

3429
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:24,895
3 years ago

3430
02:58:25,663 --> 02:58:28,735
What University of Washington was doing under Bill Gates

3431
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:30,527
Images of a nice

3432
02:58:30,783 --> 02:58:31,807
What were they doing

3433
02:58:34,111 --> 02:58:37,695
What are used to date that they don't know what they're being given this year

3434
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:39,231
So you think it's some sort of

3435
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:42,559
Alien intervention types

3436
02:58:43,839 --> 02:58:46,911
Your heart off 45 minutes

3437
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:49,471
They pump oxygen in your blood

3438
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:54,335
In the meeting

3439
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:59,199
You're in the meetings with freaking aliens

3440
02:58:59,455 --> 02:59:05,599
But there's no power shutting your heart off it makes you have that psychedelic experience biking blood in your oxygen keep you alive

3441
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:07,647
Okay

3442
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:17,375
So you can stay longer

3443
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:21,471
Understatement of the century I don't know officer

3444
02:59:21,727 --> 02:59:26,079
Like Bill Gates run Washington University

3445
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:32,991
He donated a bunch of money there because his dad wasn't alone for there any grew up in Washington

3446
02:59:33,247 --> 02:59:36,063
Yes there is an association of Bill Gates in the University wash

3447
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:42,463
45-minute for next week on how

3448
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:48,351
In order to save it

3449
02:59:48,863 --> 02:59:50,399
They house

3450
02:59:50,655 --> 02:59:52,191
Killer

3451
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:54,495
Jesus

3452
02:59:57,055 --> 02:59:58,591
I'm no doctor I'm not a scientist

3453
03:00:00,127 --> 03:00:00,639
I'm like if you

3454
03:00:00,895 --> 03:00:03,199
You did stop someone's heart and you were able to

3455
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:04,991
Blood flow to their brain

3456
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:07,295
You could keep them dead for

3457
03:00:07,551 --> 03:00:08,063
Like 5 minutes

3458
03:00:08,575 --> 03:00:10,623
It's very possible because

3459
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:12,927
The difficulty is when your heart stops

3460
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:18,815
It stops pumping blood and therefore there is an oxygen that ends up going to your brain right brain doesn't

3461
03:00:19,071 --> 03:00:20,095
Have oxygen

3462
03:00:20,351 --> 03:00:21,375
A certain amount of time

3463
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:22,143
It becomes

3464
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:23,167
Damaged

3465
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:24,191
To the point where you

3466
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:27,775
I believe that there is a

3467
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:33,663
Theoretical theoretical possibility

3468
03:00:34,175 --> 03:00:34,687
But it seems

3469
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:35,967
Incredibly

3470
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:41,087
A way that you have them go into meeting.

3471
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:42,367
I don't know

3472
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:44,159
I think that there's a lot more he needs

3473
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:45,951
Prove if

3474
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:48,767
Medically hypothetically father

3475
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:49,535
Right

3476
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:52,095
That's what I'm saying also

3477
03:00:52,863 --> 03:00:54,399
Like even though

3478
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,167
More like

3479
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:57,727
You're describing those

3480
03:00:58,495 --> 03:01:02,079
I died for 2 minutes on the table and I saw heaven

3481
03:01:02,335 --> 03:01:02,847
Vision

3482
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:03,615
Things where it's like

3483
03:01:03,871 --> 03:01:05,663
No your your ranges

3484
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:12,063
Hallucinate or anything like that

3485
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:18,463
Does deserve like a shout-out

3486
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:19,231
Outdoor whatever

3487
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:21,279
When he talks about his own

3488
03:01:22,047 --> 03:01:22,815
Experiences

3489
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:26,655
Communicated

3490
03:01:26,911 --> 03:01:27,423
With something

3491
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:29,471
But that's not to say that it wasn't

3492
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:32,287
Within my head there's no reason to assume

3493
03:01:32,543 --> 03:01:33,567
And out

3494
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:35,871
Even says I'll never be able to know

3495
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:38,175
Either way right what's the point

3496
03:01:38,431 --> 03:01:42,783
Your own subconscious

3497
03:01:45,599 --> 03:01:46,367
So like

3498
03:01:46,879 --> 03:01:47,391
Yeah

3499
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:50,463
Like

3500
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:52,767
Your best bet is

3501
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:53,791
Schrodinger's cat

3502
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:54,559
Kind of

3503
03:01:55,839 --> 03:01:57,119
Jumping into the multi

3504
03:01:57,631 --> 03:01:58,399
Swear it's like

3505
03:01:58,655 --> 03:02:02,495
You have a you keep shooting you have one bullet and you keep shooting

3506
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:03,263
You keep shooting

3507
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:04,799
And at a certain point

3508
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:08,895
You're actually realizing that you've jumped into the Multiverse

3509
03:02:09,407 --> 03:02:11,455
The only person that you could ever prove that to

3510
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:14,783
Subway

3511
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:16,319
We can

3512
03:02:17,343 --> 03:02:18,623
Subconscious mind does exist

3513
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:20,671
We haven't proven

3514
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:21,695
Extra-dimensional

3515
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:22,463
National bae

3516
03:02:22,719 --> 03:02:23,231
Do exist

3517
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:29,887
These entities that I'm talking to when I'm hallucinating

3518
03:02:30,143 --> 03:02:32,703
Are either a part of my own subconscious

3519
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:36,287
Or their demons from another dimension trying to talk to me

3520
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:39,359
Considering one of those things I'm confident is real

3521
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:41,151
The other I don't know

3522
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:44,223
I think it's probably rational to err on the side of

3523
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:45,247
I don't know

3524
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:47,807
But if I had to choose an explanation I would go with it's in your head

3525
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:48,831
No wonder you believe

3526
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:53,439
You didn't

3527
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:56,767
Alex talks about the

3528
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:59,327
Of the Bill Gates

3529
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:01,119
45 minutes ago to be just aliens

3530
03:03:01,375 --> 03:03:02,399
It turns out

3531
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,167
You technology

3532
03:03:03,423 --> 03:03:05,727
When you're in there

3533
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:08,287
Joe asks for example

3534
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:10,079
Knock knock

3535
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:14,687
And it's like the things that you tell him they come out and they tell scientist it works

3536
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:16,479
Like we're going to shed

3537
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:23,647
They didn't

3538
03:03:24,415 --> 03:03:27,743
How would you microwave

3539
03:03:27,999 --> 03:03:30,815
Yeah we're not you do with microwave anything

3540
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:38,239
Anything absolutely

3541
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:41,055
Some technology premise that

3542
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:47,455
Kill people for saying specific Technologies

3543
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:51,807
Gave them the technology flying for any kind of

3544
03:03:52,063 --> 03:03:54,623
World government to draw

3545
03:03:54,879 --> 03:03:55,391
F****** stupid

3546
03:03:56,159 --> 03:03:58,719
So now we get another childhood memory of Alex

3547
03:03:58,975 --> 03:03:59,743
Cuz where he overheard some

3548
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:00,767
But I don't believe is

3549
03:04:01,023 --> 03:04:01,791
True

3550
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:02,559
But

3551
03:04:03,071 --> 03:04:03,583
Turns out

3552
03:04:03,839 --> 03:04:04,351
Does lady

3553
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:05,631
Come over to his house

3554
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:07,935
This is is this all about f******

3555
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:09,471
No this is

3556
03:04:09,727 --> 03:04:12,287
This one's just overhearing another

3557
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:14,847
Stories are Gruffs yeah

3558
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:16,383
Gross it's just

3559
03:04:21,247 --> 03:04:22,783
This Walk This Way with come over

3560
03:04:25,599 --> 03:04:27,135
She talked about

3561
03:04:27,391 --> 03:04:30,207
Yeah we called the Psychedelic research

3562
03:04:37,375 --> 03:04:39,935
Population

3563
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:43,007
Breezy certain plans in India

3564
03:04:51,199 --> 03:04:56,831
San Francisco

3565
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:04,511
Addicted

3566
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:08,095
Google are YouTuber

3567
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:16,031
No squeezing drawing

3568
03:05:19,871 --> 03:05:23,967
They won't tell me specifically

3569
03:05:24,223 --> 03:05:28,063
Girl you sexist pig

3570
03:05:31,903 --> 03:05:32,927
For the wind one more time

3571
03:05:33,183 --> 03:05:37,535
YouTube is just alphabet

3572
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:43,935
It's just the same company

3573
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:45,727
YouTube sets 2014

3574
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:53,151
He doesn't deal with these things realistically

3575
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:54,175
If he did

3576
03:05:54,687 --> 03:06:00,319
Movie Yelling about Susan all the time because he got kicked off YouTube

3577
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:01,087
Jack

3578
03:06:01,343 --> 03:06:02,111
Yeah there's like

3579
03:06:02,367 --> 03:06:06,719
For companies who own all Media or whatever it is like everybody has their own Subs

3580
03:06:13,375 --> 03:06:16,703
Who's the CEO of YouTube

3581
03:06:17,727 --> 03:06:20,031
Yeah like in that indicates to me a lack of

3582
03:06:20,287 --> 03:06:22,079
Interest or lack of knowledge about

3583
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:23,103
And hey Eddie

3584
03:06:24,127 --> 03:06:24,639
The woman

3585
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:36,159
He does know that a lot of money off YouTube

3586
03:06:36,415 --> 03:06:38,975
CEO of YouTube

3587
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:45,375
Pretty safe to say he's in the top 1% of YouTube channel

3588
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:46,655
He's probably matter

3589
03:06:46,911 --> 03:06:47,679
Before

3590
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:51,775
Unlikely he hasn't

3591
03:06:52,031 --> 03:06:53,311
Where were you better

3592
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:01,503
Because he's one of their biggest

3593
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:04,063
But you have somebody else

3594
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:08,927
Text Samantha

3595
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:11,743
Imagine Dragons

3596
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:16,607
Not our podcast I don't think this has been a good

3597
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:17,887
Did Rogan and Alex

3598
03:07:21,727 --> 03:07:23,263
So made me real bummed out when Alex

3599
03:07:26,847 --> 03:07:28,639
Alien

3600
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:47,327
It back somehow that's disappointing

3601
03:07:47,583 --> 03:07:49,887
I figured

3602
03:07:50,143 --> 03:07:50,655
Get some Tito's

3603
03:07:51,679 --> 03:07:53,215
Disappointed

3604
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:56,799
I have lost

3605
03:07:57,055 --> 03:07:57,567
Respect

3606
03:07:58,079 --> 03:07:58,591
Alex

3607
03:07:59,871 --> 03:08:04,991
The first time he was a Highwayman

3608
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:10,367
So they talked a bit more about aliens

3609
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:11,647
And it's most

3610
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:12,671
Lee in concert

3611
03:08:12,927 --> 03:08:13,695
Sequential bulshit

3612
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:16,511
That is so vague as to be meaningless

3613
03:08:19,327 --> 03:08:19,839
The Great

3614
03:08:20,863 --> 03:08:22,143
An hour Grace well

3615
03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:23,935
If not the greys

3616
03:08:24,447 --> 03:08:26,495
What is it our Grace

3617
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:30,591
What do you mean by our grade project

3618
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:31,615
Okay alright

3619
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:37,759
Do you think grades are like a like a robot

3620
03:08:38,015 --> 03:08:41,855
I think I might've heard that theory

3621
03:08:42,111 --> 03:08:48,255
Did the ideas

3622
03:08:48,511 --> 03:08:50,815
Leaving

3623
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:05,663
Biological Android

3624
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:07,199
I mean

3625
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:13,087
Cool

3626
03:09:16,671 --> 03:09:22,559
Display Flyers that we talked about all the time

3627
03:09:22,815 --> 03:09:28,959
It's really disappointed he's way better than him because

3628
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:30,495
How's Joey

3629
03:09:30,751 --> 03:09:36,895
About stuff helps the pill go down

3630
03:09:37,151 --> 03:09:38,431
Yeah

3631
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:45,343
Because she's she has an agenda

3632
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:47,391
I need to know that Alex is going to get drunk

3633
03:09:47,647 --> 03:09:50,207
Start yelling about how aliens give us all the technical

3634
03:09:53,535 --> 03:09:59,679
Cuz now that they're past the rapprochement getting relationship

3635
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:04,543
New lies or my refined lies clear the beginning of this

3636
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:07,359
And now I'm going to make an angle for your listeners

3637
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:09,919
Because

3638
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:10,943
Spirits of God

3639
03:10:11,199 --> 03:10:11,711
But no

3640
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:18,111
I don't DMT every night because my thick neck exit and I know everything I'm a psychic I know about

3641
03:10:18,367 --> 03:10:18,879
The German

3642
03:10:19,135 --> 03:10:19,903
And the Nazis

3643
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:21,183
Meeting with aliens

3644
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:24,511
Continues to build back when he was at Washington University

3645
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:25,279
The killing people

3646
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:26,047
5 minutes

3647
03:10:26,303 --> 03:10:32,447
Ibf

3648
03:10:32,959 --> 03:10:33,727
At all

3649
03:10:33,983 --> 03:10:35,775
He does talk about it later

3650
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:42,175
Okay what he says

3651
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:44,223
But he has to reiterate it

3652
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:45,247
But

3653
03:10:45,759 --> 03:10:46,527
Because he reiterates

3654
03:10:47,039 --> 03:10:48,319
He accidentally said something

3655
03:10:48,831 --> 03:10:50,879
That most people probably don't know what he saying

3656
03:10:51,391 --> 03:10:53,951
We do

3657
03:10:54,463 --> 03:10:55,999
Me neither

3658
03:10:56,255 --> 03:10:58,303
Me neither

3659
03:10:58,815 --> 03:11:04,959
You think I give you this information sometime before the filter like for sure

3660
03:11:18,527 --> 03:11:19,807
And just because

3661
03:11:20,063 --> 03:11:21,087
He was famous

3662
03:11:25,439 --> 03:11:28,255
So you think there are

3663
03:11:28,511 --> 03:11:30,047
Especially

3664
03:11:30,303 --> 03:11:31,583
27

3665
03:11:31,839 --> 03:11:33,887
I'm sure there's people setting everybody up

3666
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:40,543
SoJO Spa because I never realized it was 2012

3667
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:44,383
Supercomputers Vic

3668
03:11:44,639 --> 03:11:50,527
Answer somebody from MIT

3669
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:51,295
Clearly misspeak

3670
03:11:51,551 --> 03:11:52,319
You said two weeks ago

3671
03:11:54,879 --> 03:11:56,927
Weeks after a

3672
03:12:03,583 --> 03:12:04,095
But

3673
03:12:04,351 --> 03:12:05,119
You-know-who

3674
03:12:05,375 --> 03:12:05,887
Alex

3675
03:12:06,143 --> 03:12:07,423
Book says in the CIA

3676
03:12:07,679 --> 03:12:08,703
You know

3677
03:12:09,727 --> 03:12:13,311
You know who else believe the Sandy Hook was fake and told Alex to say it

3678
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:18,943
Stevie punches you know who else has a degree in international relations from MIT

3679
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:25,343
He's talking about Steve pieczenik a hundred percent 100 probably doesn't want to bring that up though because Eddie Bravo

3680
03:12:27,647 --> 03:12:28,159
Yeah

3681
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:29,439
God dammit

3682
03:12:29,695 --> 03:12:32,255
He's a phantom

3683
03:12:32,511 --> 03:12:35,327
Alex

3684
03:12:35,583 --> 03:12:36,095
Direct

3685
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:38,911
Right

3686
03:12:39,167 --> 03:12:40,191
Elastic cause ripples

3687
03:12:40,447 --> 03:12:42,495
He doesn't want to have it

3688
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:44,287
But he's pretty clearly

3689
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:45,823
Bolstering

3690
03:12:46,335 --> 03:12:47,359
Steve CIA credentials

3691
03:12:47,871 --> 03:12:48,639
Stuff like that

3692
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:51,455
Probably mixing up multiple

3693
03:12:51,967 --> 03:12:52,735
But the

3694
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:54,015
He's clearly talking about

3695
03:12:54,271 --> 03:12:55,295
Is

3696
03:12:56,319 --> 03:13:00,415
A picture of match up with Xavier Verizon

3697
03:13:00,671 --> 03:13:04,511
Is this another situation where we're finding a

3698
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:06,047
1

3699
03:13:06,303 --> 03:13:09,887
Bore excuse that it's not his fault

3700
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:12,447
It's not as f*** off

3701
03:13:12,703 --> 03:13:14,495
Specific example of the excuses he was making

3702
03:13:14,751 --> 03:13:17,567
Earlier this house

3703
03:13:20,127 --> 03:13:22,175
Do you think that's possible that your sources give you missing

3704
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:28,319
If

3705
03:13:28,575 --> 03:13:29,087
You

3706
03:13:30,623 --> 03:13:31,647
Did your sources

3707
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:33,695
Sometimes give you misinformation

3708
03:13:34,719 --> 03:13:37,023
Don't operate on the information

3709
03:13:37,279 --> 03:13:37,791
People give you

3710
03:13:38,047 --> 03:13:38,815
Any of that information

3711
03:13:39,327 --> 03:13:40,095
Figure out

3712
03:13:40,351 --> 03:13:42,655
Clean information sources

3713
03:13:42,911 --> 03:13:43,935
Heaven's use those

3714
03:13:44,191 --> 03:13:48,031
Instead of his record lying to you because their own agenda

3715
03:13:48,287 --> 03:13:50,079
Rogan credits 48

3716

3717
03:13:52,895 --> 03:13:57,247
I've been followed around by a all by lights

3718
03:13:57,503 --> 03:13:58,015
That

3719
03:13:59,039 --> 03:13:59,551
Spoke

3720
03:14:00,063 --> 03:14:06,207
Volume brevity

3721
03:14:06,463 --> 03:14:06,975
Well place

3722
03:14:12,863 --> 03:14:15,423
Wouldn't work without the I'm not in the CIA

3723
03:14:15,679 --> 03:14:21,823
Mediator

3724
03:14:23,103 --> 03:14:28,479
Such a good it's clear he's been doing stand-up for decade

3725
03:14:28,735 --> 03:14:33,599
Alex's sort of press to the wall here by by the

3726
03:14:33,855 --> 03:14:34,623
At the party

3727
03:14:35,135 --> 03:14:35,903
You give

3728
03:14:36,415 --> 03:14:38,207
How do you know this stuff

3729
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:38,975
You so,

3730
03:14:39,231 --> 03:14:43,071
Confident about the ideas

3731
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:47,935
And here is where we get back to General Albert

3732
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:49,215
Dirt

3733
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:49,983
Stubblebine

3734
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:53,311
Literally been trying to find out what's going on

3735
03:14:56,639 --> 03:14:59,199
I'm not the one saying there's all these aliens

3736
03:14:59,455 --> 03:15:00,991
The entire government

3737
03:15:01,759 --> 03:15:04,831
And all these Advanced groups that's what I've given up on space

3738
03:15:05,087 --> 03:15:07,647
You're all about interdimensional

3739
03:15:08,159 --> 03:15:11,743
Okay

3740
03:15:17,375 --> 03:15:20,703
About what

3741
03:15:20,959 --> 03:15:22,495
There's not just one group of lately

3742
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:25,567
Rappers what's the different groups

3743
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:32,223
Christmas song

3744
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:36,063
You know about General stubblebine right

3745
03:15:36,319 --> 03:15:36,831
No don't

3746
03:15:39,903 --> 03:15:42,719
General

3747
03:15:42,975 --> 03:15:45,535
Clandestine operations for your scammer flight 15 years

3748
03:15:47,071 --> 03:15:50,399
Shovel for whatever

3749
03:15:51,167 --> 03:15:54,239
Also private discussions and this is like 67 years ago

3750
03:15:54,495 --> 03:15:56,031
50 years ago

3751
03:15:56,287 --> 03:15:58,335
This is the guy that ran the whole show

3752
03:16:00,383 --> 03:16:00,895
Yeah

3753
03:16:01,919 --> 03:16:05,247
That's a joke about Washington

3754
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:07,551
So this indicates

3755
03:16:08,575 --> 03:16:10,879
I hate this so much Penny does the dabancheng

3756
03:16:11,135 --> 03:16:13,439
On the Shelf like when he's talking about that invest

3757
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:16,767
The pedia article about Soros and the pound

3758
03:16:17,023 --> 03:16:23,167
Cirrhosis history

3759
03:16:23,423 --> 03:16:24,703
Walkthrough walls and teleported

3760
03:16:24,959 --> 03:16:25,727
Or whatever

3761
03:16:25,983 --> 03:16:28,799
You can just say whatever information you confide

3762
03:16:29,055 --> 03:16:31,615
You do whatever you can find

3763
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:36,735
Is a whitewash of the reality that I've been able to find now I refuse to tell you

3764
03:16:36,991 --> 03:16:43,135
Where I found that information I won't give you any citations on it I'll say it's mainstream literature

3765
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:44,671
Documents

3766
03:16:44,927 --> 03:16:46,975
All that stuff but I won't tell you anything

3767
03:16:49,023 --> 03:16:49,535
The Anythink

3768
03:16:49,791 --> 03:16:50,815
You think it's real

3769
03:16:51,327 --> 03:16:52,095
The f****** whitewash

3770
03:16:52,863 --> 03:16:53,631
And that mentality

3771
03:16:53,887 --> 03:16:57,215
He is exactly what helps was talking about the beginning of the show as being

3772
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:05,407
I got it right now

3773
03:17:05,663 --> 03:17:06,175
All the articles

3774
03:17:06,431 --> 03:17:11,295
Okay well the article doesn't say what you want

3775
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:12,575
The whitewash

3776
03:17:12,831 --> 03:17:13,343
F*** you

3777
03:17:15,135 --> 03:17:16,159
It has much to do with anything

3778
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:17,951
But it's

3779
03:17:18,207 --> 03:17:18,719
Like

3780
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:20,767
Talk to Rabbit

3781
03:17:23,327 --> 03:17:27,423
I like to celebrate that I like

3782
03:17:27,935 --> 03:17:29,727
Like a pure kind of like

3783
03:17:30,495 --> 03:17:33,055
A true esoteric

3784
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:39,455
What do you say the ocean with the Tri-River is the triage

3785
03:17:43,295 --> 03:17:43,807
It seems to

3786
03:17:44,063 --> 03:17:44,575
Tubidy

3787
03:17:44,831 --> 03:17:45,343
These moments

3788
03:17:45,599 --> 03:17:46,111
Where he's getting

3789
03:17:46,367 --> 03:17:48,671
Deeply poetic and there's no agenda

3790
03:17:48,927 --> 03:17:54,303
The two it necessarily just something weird

3791
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:58,143
Consciousness in the universe is inter-dimensional space craft

3792
03:17:58,655 --> 03:17:59,423
Beyond that

3793
03:17:59,679 --> 03:18:00,703
Those are common

3794
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:01,727
My research

3795
03:18:07,103 --> 03:18:08,127
A consciousness

3796
03:18:08,383 --> 03:18:12,223
Location

3797
03:18:15,551 --> 03:18:16,063
Okay

3798
03:18:18,879 --> 03:18:19,903
System of

3799
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:22,463
Survival ofthe fittest

3800
03:18:22,719 --> 03:18:23,231
Gotshell

3801
03:18:23,487 --> 03:18:25,279
What okay

3802
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:31,935
Hop

3803
03:18:37,055 --> 03:18:41,151
What

3804
03:18:41,663 --> 03:18:42,175
That's not a comics

3805
03:18:43,967 --> 03:18:47,295
Stop this podcast is a good way to end this motherfuker

3806
03:18:51,135 --> 03:18:52,927
Is it's gone long already passed the

3807
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:58,047
The 3-hour mark that they usually Rogan shows usually go

3808
03:18:58,303 --> 03:18:59,071
Would like both him

3809
03:19:02,655 --> 03:19:06,239
We just got the Consciousness is a comet in evils of the tail

3810
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:13,663
Call the guy that's late house party I got a lot I don't know

3811
03:19:13,919 --> 03:19:18,783
F****** baseball game extended nothing let's move on there four ways to work what kind of

3812
03:19:19,295 --> 03:19:21,087
Someone's expressing that you like

3813
03:19:21,599 --> 03:19:24,671
Not much more than enough

3814
03:19:25,183 --> 03:19:27,999
You are gone

3815
03:19:28,255 --> 03:19:34,399
Research I find comet

3816
03:19:41,055 --> 03:19:43,359
That was the fish f******

3817
03:19:44,383 --> 03:19:46,431
That was actually an

3818
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:47,455
From Al

3819
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,735
I could have been

3820
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:50,271
Back when he was 30

3821
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:55,647
Fish joke about

3822
03:20:01,279 --> 03:20:02,047
This is just

3823
03:20:02,303 --> 03:20:03,327
I mean

3824
03:20:03,839 --> 03:20:07,167
I enjoy it on one level and I enjoyed

3825
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:08,703
Incredulousness

3826
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:09,471
About it like

3827
03:20:18,175 --> 03:20:19,199
Sure man

3828
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:20,223
That's a lot of words

3829
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:26,623
Hey yeah so we're out of beer we got three left

3830
03:20:26,879 --> 03:20:28,671
Beer drinking ability

3831
03:20:30,463 --> 03:20:36,607
You know it's really time to go when I was 12 okay

3832
03:20:36,863 --> 03:20:41,727
Comment in the back part of it is evil

3833
03:20:41,983 --> 03:20:42,495
Jesus's get behind

3834
03:20:42,751 --> 03:20:46,079
Show me Satan blah blah blah

3835
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:47,103
I'm about how he's a psycho

3836
03:20:47,615 --> 03:20:50,431
He's already talked about heavy as BMT dream

3837
03:20:50,943 --> 03:20:51,711
Every night

3838
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:54,015
Everything everything

3839
03:20:56,319 --> 03:20:57,087
If I want to stay

3840
03:20:57,343 --> 03:20:58,111
The dismayed

3841
03:20:58,623 --> 03:20:59,135
Sodalite

3842
03:20:59,647 --> 03:21:00,159
Because

3843
03:21:01,695 --> 03:21:05,791
He's talked on his own show about the idea that he saw himself getting mugged in a

3844
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:11,935
What do you leave with is this

3845
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:13,215
This made me laugh so

3846
03:21:16,799 --> 03:21:18,079
Let me tell you what my

3847
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:23,455
Okay

3848
03:21:26,271 --> 03:21:29,087
Talk about 12

3849
03:21:29,343 --> 03:21:31,903
12 presents

3850
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:33,183
What

3851
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:36,511
To say that is arrogance I won't say that

3852
03:21:38,815 --> 03:21:40,351
Have had Dreams by whole life

3853
03:21:40,863 --> 03:21:41,887
It come true

3854
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:44,959
And the weirdest thing like a lady drops

3855
03:21:45,471 --> 03:21:48,799
Pickles at the store

3856
03:21:49,055 --> 03:21:50,591
I'm there

3857
03:21:54,943 --> 03:22:01,087
It was more intense it happen

3858
03:22:01,343 --> 03:22:02,879
Was it exactly how you draw

3859
03:22:04,927 --> 03:22:06,719
I would also be

3860
03:22:06,975 --> 03:22:07,487
F***

3861
03:22:07,743 --> 03:22:11,327
Because a dream about a woman dropping a jar of pickles

3862
03:22:11,583 --> 03:22:16,191
If there was some sort of like Celestial intelligence there was granting Alex his

3863
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:17,471
Prophetic vision

3864
03:22:23,615 --> 03:22:28,223
You could stop it or not doesn't matter it's inconsequential they don't care to

3865
03:22:28,479 --> 03:22:29,247
Charged with Pickles.

3866
03:22:29,503 --> 03:22:30,527
To drop someone's going to have to

3867
03:22:30,783 --> 03:22:32,319
Clean it up I guess it'll be a mile

3868
03:22:32,575 --> 03:22:33,855
Inconvenience for an employee

3869
03:22:34,111 --> 03:22:37,439
So low stakes this psychic ability

3870
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:38,975
Is

3871
03:22:39,231 --> 03:22:39,743
It turns out

3872
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:40,767
Very bad

3873
03:22:42,303 --> 03:22:42,815
Not it

3874
03:22:43,071 --> 03:22:45,631
Or try

3875
03:22:49,215 --> 03:22:50,239
This lady is going to drop

3876
03:22:50,495 --> 03:22:51,263
You f****** pickle

3877
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:53,055
What are the universal

3878
03:22:55,615 --> 03:22:56,383
God is a cucumber

3879
03:22:58,175 --> 03:22:58,943
Possible

3880
03:23:07,135 --> 03:23:08,671
Pickles because God despises

3881
03:23:08,927 --> 03:23:15,071
The pickle no no no you want it

3882
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:16,863
Alex

3883
03:23:17,375 --> 03:23:17,887
Because

3884
03:23:18,143 --> 03:23:18,655
Pickling

3885
03:23:19,167 --> 03:23:19,935
The Cucumber becomes it's

3886
03:23:20,447 --> 03:23:24,287
Much like a caterpillar

3887
03:23:24,543 --> 03:23:25,311
Into a larva

3888
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:28,383
A butterfly

3889
03:23:28,639 --> 03:23:29,919
Stager whatever

3890
03:23:31,199 --> 03:23:32,479
You put those cucumbers

3891
03:23:32,735 --> 03:23:33,503
In pickling juice

3892
03:23:33,759 --> 03:23:36,575
Become so much better not realized

3893
03:23:37,087 --> 03:23:39,135
Cucumbers are Audrey Hepburn

3894
03:23:39,391 --> 03:23:40,927
Got cucumbers are races

3895
03:23:41,183 --> 03:23:42,463
Pickles

3896
03:23:43,743 --> 03:23:44,255
Cucumbers

3897
03:23:44,511 --> 03:23:48,863
Pickles our nation is to

3898
03:23:49,119 --> 03:23:55,263
That's the that's the only

3899
03:23:57,055 --> 03:24:02,175
This conversation makes as much sense as anything Alex is so that's a bad sign

3900
03:24:05,759 --> 03:24:06,271
Prophetic dream

3901
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:07,551
And he said something

3902
03:24:07,807 --> 03:24:08,575
Think about a dream he had

3903
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:09,855
Was a much younger man

3904
03:24:10,623 --> 03:24:11,903
At this is this this

3905
03:24:12,159 --> 03:24:12,671
To me was

3906
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:14,207
Real f*****-up

3907
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:16,255
It is a little bit of a longer clip but it be

3908
03:24:16,511 --> 03:24:18,559
Because I wanted to illustrate how Alex is

3909
03:24:20,095 --> 03:24:23,167
Like the wage is not together

3910
03:24:23,423 --> 03:24:24,191
Is

3911
03:24:24,959 --> 03:24:25,471
Traveling

3912
03:24:25,727 --> 03:24:27,007
. you'll see what I mean as soon as

3913
03:24:36,735 --> 03:24:38,527
I would have this dream

3914
03:24:39,039 --> 03:24:41,855
Cuz God knows everything is a super intelligent

3915
03:24:42,111 --> 03:24:44,927
Omnipresent

3916
03:24:46,207 --> 03:24:48,511
We're trying to find out where we came from

3917
03:24:48,767 --> 03:24:51,583
God is like a virtual reality simulation as well

3918
03:24:51,839 --> 03:24:54,143
I want to jump in here really quick and say that I think that

3919
03:24:54,399 --> 03:24:54,911
Recently he

3920
03:24:55,167 --> 03:24:55,935
He read Scott out of

3921
03:24:56,191 --> 03:24:56,703
The book God

3922
03:24:57,983 --> 03:25:01,567
The guy who created Dilbert

3923
03:25:01,823 --> 03:25:03,359
Hypothetical thought experiment

3924
03:25:03,615 --> 03:25:04,383
Call God's debris

3925
03:25:04,639 --> 03:25:06,431
Many many years ago

3926
03:25:06,687 --> 03:25:08,991
Please try to be like I'm not just a Dilbert guy

3927
03:25:09,247 --> 03:25:11,807
He wrote this book it was basically the argument

3928
03:25:12,063 --> 03:25:13,343
The God knows everything

3929
03:25:13,599 --> 03:25:14,879
Except what universe

3930
03:25:15,135 --> 03:25:15,647
Without him would be

3931
03:25:16,671 --> 03:25:17,695
Receipts searches

3932
03:25:17,951 --> 03:25:18,719
For this wisdom

3933
03:25:19,743 --> 03:25:20,767
It's a lot of things that I was

3934
03:25:21,023 --> 03:25:21,791
Describing in this

3935
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:24,095
3 when he was 3 years old his dream

3936
03:25:24,351 --> 03:25:26,143
He had from the perspective of God is

3937
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:27,679
Kind of similar it's not

3938
03:25:27,935 --> 03:25:29,727
When I was 3 years old I

3939
03:25:29,983 --> 03:25:32,543
Had a dream for three straight years

3940
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:35,103
Gilbert would be a hit

3941
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:37,663
Came true

3942
03:25:37,919 --> 03:25:38,687
1 parallel

3943
03:25:38,943 --> 03:25:39,455
With Scott Adams

3944
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:42,015
Close enough that any know that

3945
03:25:42,271 --> 03:25:44,575
You've Got a Friend

3946
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:46,623
Who's been on the show botched

3947
03:25:46,879 --> 03:25:48,927
It's close enough that I think that maybe he's being a

3948
03:25:49,695 --> 03:25:50,207
Bye

3949
03:25:51,743 --> 03:25:57,887
Every program every operation

3950
03:26:01,983 --> 03:26:06,847
But the earliest memories The Edge of Insanity

3951
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:09,151
And that's not a thing

3952
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:09,919
You can say

3953
03:26:11,199 --> 03:26:14,271
It was a message

3954
03:26:14,527 --> 03:26:18,879
Skyward

3955
03:26:19,391 --> 03:26:20,927
I would have to go into that

3956
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:25,279
Trying to figure out what was going on in Everett

3957
03:26:35,775 --> 03:26:41,407
And like knowing what's going to happen before it happens and then questioning it and then it never been wrong

3958
03:26:43,967 --> 03:26:46,271
Crazy stuff man like

3959
03:26:46,783 --> 03:26:50,367
I just so much stuff where it becomes like

3960
03:26:52,671 --> 03:26:54,207
You just reach that point where

3961
03:26:56,255 --> 03:26:59,327
You don't even know what's real anymore because it's so crazy

3962
03:26:59,583 --> 03:27:02,143
Can you see like

3963
03:27:04,447 --> 03:27:10,079
You talk about it

3964
03:27:14,175 --> 03:27:17,247
That's what freaked him out

3965
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:27,999
What about to do with the speech

3966
03:27:28,255 --> 03:27:29,791
Trump speech

3967
03:27:31,327 --> 03:27:37,471
Sometimes

3968
03:27:51,295 --> 03:27:52,063
Your brain works

3969
03:27:52,831 --> 03:27:53,855
He's changing

3970
03:27:54,367 --> 03:27:54,879
Making Connections work

3971
03:27:55,135 --> 03:27:56,159
Connections don't exist

3972
03:27:56,415 --> 03:27:58,207
He's talking about one thing and realizing

3973
03:27:58,463 --> 03:27:59,231
He's in over his head

3974
03:27:59,487 --> 03:28:01,023
And not making sense so we can

3975
03:28:01,279 --> 03:28:02,047
Something else like

3976
03:28:02,303 --> 03:28:05,887
I say things on the president repeat them in the CIA is freaked out by it

3977
03:28:08,191 --> 03:28:08,959
Yeah

3978
03:28:09,215 --> 03:28:09,727
Childish

3979
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:10,495
Affect

3980
03:28:13,311 --> 03:28:13,823
Like

3981
03:28:14,079 --> 03:28:14,847
As much of a goof

3982
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:18,431
Gullible weirdo

3983
03:28:18,687 --> 03:28:21,247
Do you still on the level enough to be like I don't

3984
03:28:21,759 --> 03:28:22,527
You're talkin about

3985
03:28:22,783 --> 03:28:24,063
What is that

3986
03:28:24,319 --> 03:28:28,415
This subject you were talking about you started by talking about dreams you had from

3987
03:28:28,671 --> 03:28:29,439
God's eyes

3988
03:28:29,695 --> 03:28:31,743
Or whatever when you were three and now we're talkin

3989
03:28:31,999 --> 03:28:33,023
I'm about you and the president

3990
03:28:33,279 --> 03:28:34,815
Mirroring each other in the CIA

3991
03:28:35,071 --> 03:28:40,703
You aren't making sense if I were ever to be

3992
03:28:40,959 --> 03:28:45,311
Gifted with the opportunity to see the edge of infinity

3993
03:28:46,079 --> 03:28:47,615
I would come back

3994
03:28:48,127 --> 03:28:51,199
With a bit more of a higher mindset then

3995
03:28:51,711 --> 03:28:54,271
Become a talk show host and claimed at Sandy Hook

3996
03:28:55,039 --> 03:28:57,087
And aggressively never read

3997
03:28:57,855 --> 03:29:03,999
But then expanded to the point where I

3998
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:07,839
Bulshit

3999
03:29:08,351 --> 03:29:09,119
Some sort of a yacht

4000
03:29:09,887 --> 03:29:13,471
Star baby doesn't want to become a positive influence

4001
03:29:13,727 --> 03:29:15,007
Of people like 8

4002
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:16,799
Leave these Petty differences behind

4003
03:29:17,823 --> 03:29:23,967
Or even then or what Alex impulsively

4004
03:29:24,479 --> 03:29:29,343
It doesn't mean anything literal edge of infinity

4005
03:29:30,367 --> 03:29:30,879
Friar version

4006
03:29:31,647 --> 03:29:32,415
Nihilistic

4007
03:29:34,463 --> 03:29:37,535
Yeah he thinks that he's the guy who's telling people all this stuff doesn't matter

4008
03:29:38,047 --> 03:29:40,607
When in reality all he does is

4009
03:29:40,863 --> 03:29:42,655
Aggressively over-inflate

4010
03:29:44,447 --> 03:29:47,263
To reinforce status quo whether it be racial

4011
03:29:47,519 --> 03:29:48,543
Gender-based

4012
03:29:50,079 --> 03:29:50,591
Leaving like that

4013
03:29:52,895 --> 03:29:53,663
The definition

4014
03:29:53,919 --> 03:29:54,431
Of

4015
03:29:54,687 --> 03:29:55,455
Of make

4016
03:29:55,711 --> 03:29:56,223
Looking things

4017
03:29:56,479 --> 03:29:56,991
Regressive

4018
03:29:58,783 --> 03:30:01,343
The presentation is I'm above the right left paradigm

4019
03:30:01,599 --> 03:30:02,879
Whatever

4020
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:04,927
It's nonsense

4021
03:30:05,695 --> 03:30:06,207
Anyway

4022
03:30:06,463 --> 03:30:08,511
It should make this is also this next clip

4023
03:30:09,023 --> 03:30:10,047
Want to play this

4024
03:30:10,303 --> 03:30:10,815
Kind of half

4025
03:30:11,327 --> 03:30:12,351
If you're going over this episode

4026
03:30:12,607 --> 03:30:14,655
This is the other thing that everyone's going to put into

4027
03:30:14,911 --> 03:30:15,423
Gifts

4028
03:30:15,679 --> 03:30:19,007
And I understand why but I thought

4029
03:30:23,871 --> 03:30:26,175
Problem

4030
03:30:26,431 --> 03:30:27,711
What's not funny

4031
03:30:27,967 --> 03:30:32,831
Rap music

4032
03:30:38,719 --> 03:30:39,743
Alex

4033
03:30:40,255 --> 03:30:41,535
Exhaling aggressively

4034
03:30:42,047 --> 03:30:42,559
Cuz you realized like

4035
03:30:43,839 --> 03:30:44,351
Going to make a point

4036
03:30:44,607 --> 03:30:45,119
With that but I just

4037
03:30:46,143 --> 03:30:46,911
Everything is done

4038
03:30:47,935 --> 03:30:51,007
Yeah I find that disgusting even in terms of Alex

4039
03:30:51,263 --> 03:30:53,311
Whatever you trying to say about himself

4040
03:30:53,567 --> 03:30:54,591
Or whatever

4041
03:30:55,103 --> 03:30:57,151
F*** off you think that's.

4042
03:30:57,407 --> 03:30:58,943
He's being like self-effacing in

4043
03:30:59,199 --> 03:30:59,711
Humble

4044
03:30:59,967 --> 03:31:01,503
And what he's really big is

4045
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:02,527
Dismissive

4046
03:31:02,783 --> 03:31:04,319
And disgusting

4047
03:31:05,599 --> 03:31:07,391
We get to the tobacco

4048
03:31:08,159 --> 03:31:09,183
I can I can say for sure

4049
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:10,719
If you watch if you hadn't smoked

4050
03:31:10,975 --> 03:31:11,487
Penny tobacco

4051
03:31:11,743 --> 03:31:12,255
Before then

4052
03:31:16,607 --> 03:31:21,471
Regular marijuana

4053
03:31:32,735 --> 03:31:35,551
I ain't got no blunt

4054
03:31:36,575 --> 03:31:37,343
Is God is always

4055
03:31:38,879 --> 03:31:41,183
In the beginning of the show

4056
03:31:41,695 --> 03:31:42,463
He was misled

4057
03:31:43,231 --> 03:31:45,023
He was all of this s***

4058
03:31:45,535 --> 03:31:50,911
And then later on in the show he says his guts never wrong

4059
03:31:51,167 --> 03:31:51,935
Going to drop pickles

4060
03:31:52,447 --> 03:31:55,519
Or something like that

4061
03:31:55,775 --> 03:32:01,919
Oh this vilamit scientist guy named Steve

4062
03:32:02,175 --> 03:32:02,687
Miss leave you at

4063
03:32:02,943 --> 03:32:05,503
Completely destroy right whatever you were doing

4064
03:32:05,759 --> 03:32:06,783
You don't have any of

4065
03:32:07,039 --> 03:32:07,551
The important

4066
03:32:07,807 --> 03:32:08,319
Instinct

4067
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:11,135
Whatever he has like he thinks like my guts never wrong

4068
03:32:11,391 --> 03:32:14,719
On the table is God is always wrong

4069
03:32:14,975 --> 03:32:15,487
Beatles

4070
03:32:15,999 --> 03:32:16,767
Is

4071
03:32:17,023 --> 03:32:18,047
Heathen taken to a cow

4072
03:32:18,303 --> 03:32:19,071
These other things were

4073
03:32:19,839 --> 03:32:20,351
Cinctive light him

4074
03:32:20,607 --> 03:32:21,119
Deeply

4075
03:32:21,375 --> 03:32:21,887
People astray

4076
03:32:22,143 --> 03:32:22,655
Right

4077
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:23,679
And that's

4078
03:32:23,935 --> 03:32:24,447
To me like

4079
03:32:27,263 --> 03:32:28,543
It's like he's describing

4080
03:32:28,799 --> 03:32:29,567
The worst

4081
03:32:29,823 --> 03:32:30,847
X-Men power you

4082
03:32:31,103 --> 03:32:31,615
You could have like

4083
03:32:31,871 --> 03:32:32,895
I look

4084
03:32:33,407 --> 03:32:34,175
I'm a mutant

4085
03:32:34,943 --> 03:32:35,455
I have these

4086
03:32:35,711 --> 03:32:36,479
Psychic powers

4087
03:32:36,991 --> 03:32:39,039
But they're all cucumber base

4088
03:32:40,063 --> 03:32:40,831
That is my gift

4089
03:32:41,599 --> 03:32:43,391
And then Professor X's

4090
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:45,183

Weave

4092

03:32:57,471 --> 03:32:58,239
Be more like ad

4097
03:32:59,007 --> 03:33:01,567
No like

4098
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:06,687
You're not useful fighting Magneto right unless

4099
03:33:07,199 --> 03:33:09,247
True words can you make

4100
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:15,903
A Marvel hit us up

4101
03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:18,207
I just saw that trailer for dark Phoenix

4102
03:33:19,231 --> 03:33:22,047
Peruse the magnetic

4103
03:33:22,559 --> 03:33:23,071
Put

4104
03:33:24,351 --> 03:33:27,423
Gene Dragon do against the magnetic pickle guy

4105
03:33:28,447 --> 03:33:29,471
F****** nothing

4106
03:33:29,727 --> 03:33:31,519
So at this point Alex guitar

4107
03:33:31,775 --> 03:33:33,055
And you type pretty

4108
03:33:36,895 --> 03:33:37,407
Conversation

4109
03:33:37,919 --> 03:33:38,687
They had off air

4110
03:33:39,199 --> 03:33:39,711
Addition

4111
03:33:39,967 --> 03:33:40,479
Bulshit

4112
03:33:40,735 --> 03:33:42,271
Whatever he was telling Joe

4113
03:33:42,527 --> 03:33:44,319
Before they started is b*******

4114
03:33:44,831 --> 03:33:45,343
The ways percent

4115
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:46,879
Also both

4116
03:33:47,647 --> 03:33:53,791
Tell me what

4117
03:33:54,047 --> 03:33:56,351
You were actually you even before all this happen

4118
03:33:56,607 --> 03:33:58,143
You were planning your exit strategy

4119
03:33:58,655 --> 03:33:59,679
Are you get weary of the

4120
03:34:03,263 --> 03:34:04,287
Fredo fight

4121
03:34:04,799 --> 03:34:05,567
945

4122
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:09,151
Long adventurous lifestyle power like 60

4123
03:34:09,663 --> 03:34:10,175
That isn't

4124
03:34:10,431 --> 03:34:12,735
Sure

4125
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:14,271
He had to have

4126
03:34:14,783 --> 03:34:15,295
Thinking about cash

4127
03:34:15,551 --> 03:34:16,575
Hangout

4128
03:34:17,087 --> 03:34:17,599
For sure

4129
03:34:17,855 --> 03:34:19,391
But I also don't believe that it was

4130
03:34:19,647 --> 03:34:20,159
Before the

4131
03:34:20,671 --> 03:34:23,231
Looking

4132
03:34:24,511 --> 03:34:27,839
There wasn't there wasn't part of him that was like

4133
03:34:28,095 --> 03:34:29,631
Eager for The Fray he was all in

4134
03:34:29,887 --> 03:34:31,679
It what happened is after the election

4135
03:34:31,935 --> 03:34:33,471
We realized I've committed

4136
03:34:35,007 --> 03:34:41,151
And also I have nobody who can take over the operation that I can get a piece of retired

4137
03:34:41,407 --> 03:34:41,919
Selfie

4138
03:34:42,687 --> 03:34:43,455
Negative situation

4139
03:34:43,967 --> 03:34:45,247
But it does Judaism

4140
03:34:45,503 --> 03:34:46,015
Mythology

4141
03:34:46,527 --> 03:34:47,039
Beneficial to

4142
03:34:47,807 --> 03:34:50,879
To make it look like he wanted to quit before all this started

4143
03:34:51,135 --> 03:34:52,159
Of course

4144
03:34:52,415 --> 03:34:53,183
Victimization

4145
03:34:53,695 --> 03:34:54,207
Globalist

4146
03:34:54,719 --> 03:34:55,999
Really kicked into overdrive

4147
03:34:56,255 --> 03:34:56,767
And that's what he

4148
03:35:00,607 --> 03:35:01,631
I was already

4149
03:35:01,887 --> 03:35:03,935
Like I wasn't sure about Trump or whatever

4150
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:18,015
Elephant attack me so much makes me have a battle at 5 never give up

4151
03:35:18,783 --> 03:35:20,575
And an insult

4152
03:35:23,647 --> 03:35:25,439
They kept me in the game I was playing

4153
03:35:25,695 --> 03:35:28,255
They kept me in the game attacking me lying about me

4154
03:35:32,863 --> 03:35:34,143
Now I do a lot of stuff

4155
03:35:34,655 --> 03:35:35,679
So

4156
03:35:36,447 --> 03:35:36,959
He always

4157
03:35:40,031 --> 03:35:40,543
F*** off

4158
03:35:40,799 --> 03:35:42,079
You got reinvigorated by

4159
03:35:43,103 --> 03:35:45,407
Christmas present supremacist

4160
03:35:46,175 --> 03:35:47,967
Guy was ahead of chance

4161
03:35:48,223 --> 03:35:50,527
The Wynn

4162
03:35:50,783 --> 03:35:51,551
But now the consequence

4163
03:35:51,807 --> 03:35:52,575
The chickens have come home

4164
03:35:52,831 --> 03:35:54,111
You don't like it

4165
03:35:54,623 --> 03:35:55,391
Because people are like

4166
03:35:55,647 --> 03:35:56,415
Hey dick

4167
03:35:57,183 --> 03:35:58,975
We put up with this for a long time

4168
03:35:59,231 --> 03:36:00,767
And now it's unsustainable

4169
03:36:01,023 --> 03:36:02,047
Now you're a problem

4170
03:36:02,559 --> 03:36:05,375
We should go

4171
03:36:05,631 --> 03:36:06,911
Should have dealt with you but you were too

4172
03:36:07,167 --> 03:36:09,983
Just a goofy soccer who was lying about everything

4173
03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:10,751
In a

4174
03:36:11,775 --> 03:36:12,287
Find what

4175
03:36:12,543 --> 03:36:15,103
Systemic

4176
03:36:15,359 --> 03:36:16,383
Piece of a

4177
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:17,663
Upholding a system

4178
03:36:17,919 --> 03:36:18,431
That is

4179
03:36:19,455 --> 03:36:19,967
Killing people

4180
03:36:20,479 --> 03:36:25,343
So the report recently about the

4181
03:36:26,879 --> 03:36:29,183
Yep set up at the border

4182
03:36:29,695 --> 03:36:31,231
He's a part of Defending

4183
03:36:31,999 --> 03:36:36,351
Do the part of Defending bolsonaro in Brazil

4184
03:36:36,607 --> 03:36:37,375
Defending now

4185
03:36:37,631 --> 03:36:39,167
The regime change in Venezuela

4186
03:36:39,679 --> 03:36:42,495
He's a part of rationalizing trump doing this

4187
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:43,775
Dumbass

4188
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:45,823
Publicity stunt b******* in North

4189
03:36:46,079 --> 03:36:47,871
Korea the only helps

4190
03:36:48,127 --> 03:36:49,663
Like he's a part of Defending these

4191
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:51,711
Dangerous

4192
03:36:52,735 --> 03:36:54,015
And I understand like

4193
03:36:54,271 --> 03:36:55,039
The foreign policy tonight

4194
03:36:55,551 --> 03:36:56,063
Wasn't

4195
03:36:56,831 --> 03:36:58,367
4 or anything like that

4196
03:37:00,159 --> 03:37:00,927
Worse now

4197
03:37:05,023 --> 03:37:08,607
Yeah I'm not going to go to American foreign power am I

4198
03:37:08,863 --> 03:37:15,007
Ciara

4199
03:37:15,263 --> 03:37:17,055
American f****** Revolution

4200
03:37:17,311 --> 03:37:19,615
As American foreign policy

4201
03:37:19,871 --> 03:37:22,943
Yeah the difference

4202
03:37:23,455 --> 03:37:24,479
Today is

4203
03:37:24,991 --> 03:37:26,015
Or at least the appearance of a

4204
03:37:27,295 --> 03:37:28,575
I think of that does has

4205
03:37:29,599 --> 03:37:30,111
A marked difference

4206
03:37:30,623 --> 03:37:31,391
And how you're presenting

4207
03:37:31,647 --> 03:37:32,927
Yeah

4208
03:37:33,183 --> 03:37:33,695
That is

4209
03:37:33,951 --> 03:37:34,719
Is deeply chaotic

4210
03:37:36,255 --> 03:37:37,535
It allows a lot of Bad actors

4211
03:37:39,071 --> 03:37:39,583
Advantage of

4212
03:37:40,095 --> 03:37:40,863
I think

4213
03:37:41,375 --> 03:37:42,655
Huge part of

4214
03:37:42,911 --> 03:37:46,239
Mainstreaming even before the election in the lead-up to

4215
03:37:47,007 --> 03:37:49,055
Mainstreaming in normalizing a lot of those eyes

4216
03:37:49,311 --> 03:37:50,079
He has that now

4217
03:37:50,335 --> 03:37:51,615
Have grown Beyond him

4218
03:37:52,127 --> 03:37:53,663
Like they're now on Tucker every

4219
03:37:58,783 --> 03:37:59,295
Before

4220
03:37:59,551 --> 03:38:00,575
Well in the way that they had.

4221
03:38:00,831 --> 03:38:01,599
Hide

4222
03:38:01,855 --> 03:38:05,951
Exactly believed all this s*** but they had it's not part of public this

4223
03:38:07,999 --> 03:38:10,303
I'll help make that apart of public

4224
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:11,327
Hell yeah

4225
03:38:12,863 --> 03:38:13,375
So

4226
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:15,935
I don't know I mean if you don't like you want to duck the consequence

4227
03:38:16,191 --> 03:38:16,703
Satisfying

4228
03:38:17,727 --> 03:38:18,239
Not fine

4229
03:38:18,495 --> 03:38:21,567
No I mean I understand it.

4230
03:38:23,103 --> 03:38:23,615
You can't

4231
03:38:23,871 --> 03:38:27,455
In the same way you can't jump the consequences of what you said about Sandy Hook

4232
03:38:27,711 --> 03:38:28,735
I don't care if you're staying

4233
03:38:29,759 --> 03:38:30,271
You did

4234
03:38:30,527 --> 03:38:31,039
You did that

4235
03:38:31,807 --> 03:38:33,087
You had millions of listeners

4236
03:38:33,599 --> 03:38:34,623
You knew what kind of info

4237
03:38:36,159 --> 03:38:36,927
Who doesn't matter

4238
03:38:37,183 --> 03:38:38,975
Whatever you want to do now doesn't matter

4239
03:38:39,487 --> 03:38:40,255
The damage is done

4240
03:38:41,023 --> 03:38:41,791
So when he's

4241
03:38:42,047 --> 03:38:45,119
He's talking about all this b******* like I wanted to quit I don't have a heart attack

4242
03:38:45,631 --> 03:38:46,143
50 50

4243
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:48,703
That's just his mythology

4244
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:51,519
That's rationalizing where he is now

4245
03:38:52,543 --> 03:38:54,847
Pretending all of these attacks that are coming against him

4246
03:38:55,871 --> 03:38:56,383
I just came out of nowhere

4247
03:38:57,919 --> 03:38:58,687
The strawman version

4248
03:39:00,735 --> 03:39:01,503
I hate

4249
03:39:01,759 --> 03:39:02,527
All these people

4250
03:39:03,551 --> 03:39:04,063
The way that I

4251
03:39:05,599 --> 03:39:06,367
Becoming an that made

4252
03:39:07,647 --> 03:39:11,487
Endometriosis

4253
03:39:13,535 --> 03:39:15,071
You don't talk that much about Trump

4254
03:39:15,839 --> 03:39:16,607
But he does

4255
03:39:18,655 --> 03:39:19,935
Not as strong as

4256
03:39:20,191 --> 03:39:21,215
Trump shows that Isis

4257
03:39:21,471 --> 03:39:22,239
Is a dirty a******

4258
03:39:23,007 --> 03:39:23,519
But it's not

4259
03:39:23,775 --> 03:39:24,799
For off in some way

4260
03:39:36,319 --> 03:39:37,599
I hate Donald Trump

4261
03:39:39,135 --> 03:39:41,951
Because I got behind Hillary was bad

4262
03:39:42,207 --> 03:39:47,071
And then he became my

4263
03:39:48,095 --> 03:39:54,239
Because

4264
03:40:02,431 --> 03:40:03,199
Your trunk

4265
03:40:04,991 --> 03:40:11,135
In a fight like this with so dumb.

4266
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:20,607
Place like

4267
03:40:30,335 --> 03:40:32,127
Personal perspective than I appreciate that

4268
03:40:32,383 --> 03:40:36,223
But he's not here. I don't know how many people actually think that he's your identity

4269
03:40:36,735 --> 03:40:37,247
I do

4270
03:40:37,503 --> 03:40:39,807
I do you know

4271
03:40:41,855 --> 03:40:42,367
Complaining about

4272
03:40:42,623 --> 03:40:44,159
The end result of his

4273
03:40:45,183 --> 03:40:45,951
He's complaining

4274
03:40:46,207 --> 03:40:48,767
People perceive in him as like Donald Trump as my identity

4275
03:40:49,023 --> 03:40:51,071
14 years all he did

4276
03:40:51,327 --> 03:40:52,351
Was get on his show in

4277
03:40:52,607 --> 03:40:57,727
Everything possible to muddy the water in defend indefensible things that Trump was doing

4278
03:41:00,031 --> 03:41:03,359
Nationalism

4279
03:41:03,615 --> 03:41:04,383
Like all that s***

4280
03:41:04,895 --> 03:41:05,919
The idea that he's like

4281
03:41:06,431 --> 03:41:07,199
He made his

4282
03:41:07,455 --> 03:41:08,223
F****** bad if you

4283
03:41:09,503 --> 03:41:13,599
That is what's going on with my identity

4284
03:41:14,111 --> 03:41:15,391
Then why you behave the way you

4285
03:41:15,647 --> 03:41:16,159
You did

4286
03:41:16,671 --> 03:41:17,695
Problem

4287
03:41:18,207 --> 03:41:19,231
Your behavior

4288
03:41:19,487 --> 03:41:20,511
Is what led to this

4289
03:41:21,023 --> 03:41:23,583
If you hadn't said that everyone at Sandy Hook

4290
03:41:23,839 --> 03:41:24,351
Where actor

4291
03:41:24,863 --> 03:41:26,399
And you haven't called that pain

4292
03:41:26,655 --> 03:41:27,935
You hadn't done that

4293
03:41:28,191 --> 03:41:29,727
No one would say you did

4294
03:41:30,495 --> 03:41:31,775
That is absurd

4295
03:41:32,031 --> 03:41:33,055
No one would do that

4296
03:41:33,567 --> 03:41:34,335
I wouldn't do that

4297
03:41:34,847 --> 03:41:36,127
I treat Alex

4298
03:41:36,383 --> 03:41:39,711
The most fairly than anybody ever.

4299
03:41:39,967 --> 03:41:43,295
It's disconcerting for someone who has much as I do

4300
03:41:43,807 --> 03:41:44,575
And studies in

4301
03:41:45,855 --> 03:41:46,367
Next time buddy

4302
03:41:46,879 --> 03:41:47,391
I am

4303
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:49,183
Overly Fair

4304
03:41:49,951 --> 03:41:51,487
And I would never characterize him

4305
03:41:51,999 --> 03:41:53,535
Is acting the way

4306
03:41:55,327 --> 03:41:56,095
Is part of his identity

4307
03:41:56,351 --> 03:41:56,863
If he he

4308
03:41:57,375 --> 03:41:57,887
Mated apart

4309
03:41:58,911 --> 03:42:02,751
I would never say that Trump is his identity just said if he had

4310
03:42:03,007 --> 03:42:07,359
Branded himself that way intentional I was going to say

4311
03:42:07,615 --> 03:42:09,151
So for 3 years

4312
03:42:09,407 --> 03:42:15,551
Non-stop I talked about how great was and how close I am all the time

4313
03:42:15,807 --> 03:42:21,951
I would die for her

4314
03:42:24,255 --> 03:42:26,559
And now people think that I'm just the Trump guy

4315
03:42:30,143 --> 03:42:30,655
People think I like

4316
03:42:30,911 --> 03:42:32,703
Props

4317
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:38,079
Dude that's your career

4318
03:42:38,335 --> 03:42:39,871
He discovered the prop active

4319
03:42:40,127 --> 03:42:40,639
Electric

4320
03:42:41,407 --> 03:42:42,175
To the main

4321
03:42:43,711 --> 03:42:44,735
Headlining

4322
03:42:44,991 --> 03:42:45,759
Yeah Alex

4323
03:42:46,015 --> 03:42:46,783
Have

4324
03:42:47,039 --> 03:42:49,343
A career that was based on other things

4325
03:42:50,367 --> 03:42:52,671
But it certainly turbocharged your career

4326
03:42:52,927 --> 03:42:53,439
Did you ran with

4327
03:42:53,951 --> 03:42:54,463
Intentional

4328
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:55,487
That was your

4329
03:42:55,743 --> 03:42:57,791
Gimmick you accepted

4330
03:42:58,047 --> 03:42:59,839
And you now have to accept

4331
03:43:00,095 --> 03:43:00,863
That you did that

4332
03:43:01,375 --> 03:43:02,911
To deny that is

4333
03:43:07,519 --> 03:43:08,031
For money

4334
03:43:08,287 --> 03:43:10,335
Right and you didn't believe a f***

4335
03:43:10,591 --> 03:43:12,639
King word

4336
03:43:12,895 --> 03:43:13,919
To do cuz it would

4337
03:43:14,431 --> 03:43:16,735
Give a little bit more Credence to these like

4338
03:43:17,247 --> 03:43:18,271
I don't want this

4339
03:43:18,527 --> 03:43:19,295
To be me I just

4340
03:43:19,551 --> 03:43:20,063
Accepted this

4341
03:43:20,319 --> 03:43:21,087
Because of crass

4342
03:43:21,343 --> 03:43:24,671
Consideration

4343
03:43:24,927 --> 03:43:29,279
Exactly

4344
03:43:29,791 --> 03:43:33,375
Yeah it's the only way what he's presenting worth that get the f*** out of here

4345
03:43:33,887 --> 03:43:34,399
With your like

4346
03:43:34,911 --> 03:43:37,215
I don't want I don't want people to think that that's my ident

4347
03:43:39,263 --> 03:43:39,775
Because of

4348
03:43:40,287 --> 03:43:40,799
Gofucker

4349
03:43:41,311 --> 03:43:41,823
Exactly

4350
03:43:42,079 --> 03:43:43,103
So

4351
03:43:43,615 --> 03:43:44,127
East High

4352
03:43:44,639 --> 03:43:45,407
Okay

4353
03:43:48,479 --> 03:43:50,783
But the fact that quick

4354
03:43:51,295 --> 03:43:54,623
Does kind of give me some

4355
03:43:56,159 --> 03:44:00,767
Yeah maybe you don't get high but he doesn't get high

4356
03:44:01,023 --> 03:44:05,631
If you're getting that quick you probably won't talk to me

4357
03:44:09,471 --> 03:44:09,983
And paranoid

4358
03:44:13,055 --> 03:44:13,567
I totally

4359
03:44:14,847 --> 03:44:15,871
I probably

4360
03:44:16,895 --> 03:44:18,175
Ingested marijuana

4361
03:44:18,431 --> 03:44:19,199
Edible

4362
03:44:20,479 --> 03:44:21,759
Three times in the last

4363
03:44:23,295 --> 03:44:24,319
Or something like that

4364
03:44:24,575 --> 03:44:30,207
Loved it when I was much younger but

4365
03:44:34,047 --> 03:44:34,815
And what have you put like

4366
03:44:35,071 --> 03:44:36,607
I understand that the idea

4367
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:37,375
Because like I don't smoke

4368
03:44:37,887 --> 03:44:39,423
And it's be fair if I were in

4369
03:44:39,679 --> 03:44:40,191
Situation

4370
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:42,239
Comprable to Alex being in a stew

4371
03:44:42,495 --> 03:44:45,311
Studio with Eddie Bravo and Rogan

4372
03:44:45,823 --> 03:44:47,359
Of course

4373
03:44:47,615 --> 03:44:50,175
If the stakes were tires without stealing with right now

4374
03:44:50,687 --> 03:44:52,223
Probably wouldn't smoke

4375
03:44:52,735 --> 03:44:58,623
I get doesn't seem like a good idea to f****** your heads face while at the same time being sued by Sandy Hook

4376
03:44:58,879 --> 03:45:00,415
Victor

4377
03:45:00,671 --> 03:45:03,743
I think he thinks he's navigated the territory successfully

4378
03:45:03,999 --> 03:45:04,511
And now we're going to the

4379
03:45:04,767 --> 03:45:06,815
The fun part of the trip

4380
03:45:07,071 --> 03:45:09,119
I'm not coming down on him

4381
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:10,143
I think it's a dumb idea

4382
03:45:10,399 --> 03:45:13,471
I wouldn't do it just because

4383
03:45:15,007 --> 03:45:15,775
I would rather this

4384
03:45:16,287 --> 03:45:18,335
Disappeared

4385
03:45:21,151 --> 03:45:21,919
Real weird

4386
03:45:25,759 --> 03:45:31,903
It's like how some people react like getting Doug with high or whatever it is where it's black

4387
03:45:32,159 --> 03:45:36,767
Take down

4388
03:45:37,279 --> 03:45:38,303
Yeah

4389
03:45:38,815 --> 03:45:39,327
Yeah

4390
03:45:43,167 --> 03:45:44,191
But like I said hi

4391
03:45:44,447 --> 03:45:45,727
And he should be

4392
03:45:45,983 --> 03:45:46,495
Responded

4393
03:45:47,263 --> 03:45:47,775
Campaign

4394
03:45:48,031 --> 03:45:49,567
Cool

4395
03:45:54,175 --> 03:45:56,735
But I'm just

4396
03:45:57,759 --> 03:46:00,575
So can I have a little bit more of a personality

4397
03:46:00,831 --> 03:46:01,599
He's a in them

4398
03:46:03,135 --> 03:46:04,415
Give me more weed

4399
03:46:04,927 --> 03:46:05,695
It fucken tired

4400
03:46:05,951 --> 03:46:06,463
Because I think

4401
03:46:07,487 --> 03:46:11,327
Killing the park

4402
03:46:11,583 --> 03:46:12,607
I want more weed

4403
03:46:12,863 --> 03:46:18,239
Example of

4404
03:46:19,007 --> 03:46:20,799
And your

4405
03:46:21,823 --> 03:46:22,847
Complete enabling

4406
03:46:23,103 --> 03:46:24,383
Personality

4407
03:46:24,895 --> 03:46:26,175
Again

4408
03:46:26,687 --> 03:46:27,199
If Joe Rogan

4409
03:46:28,735 --> 03:46:31,295
I think I would be f****** fascinating

4410
03:46:36,415 --> 03:46:37,951
Yeah get it really f***** up because they

4411
03:46:38,207 --> 03:46:38,975
Crazyshit

4412
03:46:39,231 --> 03:46:39,999
But to be fair

4413
03:46:40,255 --> 03:46:42,047
The craziest s*** that he said

4414
03:46:42,303 --> 03:46:43,327
Was when he was

4415
03:46:44,351 --> 03:46:45,887
Early parts of drunk

4416
03:46:46,143 --> 03:46:46,655
Just

4417
03:46:47,167 --> 03:46:50,751
Just dropped glasses of Tito's in he's talking about Native

4418
03:46:51,007 --> 03:46:51,519
Perkins being easy

4419
03:46:51,775 --> 03:46:52,543
The mind control

4420
03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:57,919
F***** up things like his grandfather being Uber mention

4421
03:46:58,175 --> 03:47:00,735
And stuff like that before any of the weed comes in

4422
03:47:00,991 --> 03:47:01,503
Yeah

4423
03:47:02,783 --> 03:47:03,295
Your

4424
03:47:04,063 --> 03:47:09,695
You're on grounds that you're comfortable being on you drink a bit it's super weird

4425
03:47:10,207 --> 03:47:11,231
Artio

4426
03:47:11,487 --> 03:47:11,999
In that

4427
03:47:12,255 --> 03:47:18,143
What that what he said earlier we've just kind of moved on from we have to and then and then you're like

4428
03:47:18,655 --> 03:47:20,191
You brought it up again like wait

4429
03:47:20,703 --> 03:47:25,055
It really did save Native Americans were susceptible to Minecon

4430
03:47:25,311 --> 03:47:26,847
Control

4431
03:47:28,895 --> 03:47:31,967
That's at the end of the ship you don't like

4432
03:47:32,991 --> 03:47:34,271
Get out of here

4433
03:47:37,343 --> 03:47:37,855
Huh

4434
03:47:39,135 --> 03:47:40,159
Just wife isn't good

4435
03:47:40,415 --> 03:47:41,183
As an exercise

4436
03:47:41,439 --> 03:47:42,719
You know it's just not a good thing to

4437
03:47:42,975 --> 03:47:43,487
To do

4438
03:47:43,743 --> 03:47:44,255
Disorder show

4439
03:47:44,511 --> 03:47:45,023
Right

4440
03:47:46,047 --> 03:47:46,815
F****** positive

4441
03:47:47,327 --> 03:47:48,607
If we paid as much attention to

4442
03:47:48,863 --> 03:47:49,887
Two other episodes of Rogan

4443
03:47:50,143 --> 03:47:50,911
Pinchot as we do with what

4444
03:47:51,167 --> 03:47:53,983
More than enough

4445
03:47:56,543 --> 03:47:57,055
Yuna

4446
03:47:57,567 --> 03:48:02,175
Alex puskita more tobacco

4447
03:48:02,431 --> 03:48:02,943
Super

4448
03:48:06,527 --> 03:48:09,599
So that's popped a little more tobacco.

4449
03:48:10,111 --> 03:48:10,879
Shout out to

4450
03:48:11,135 --> 03:48:15,231
Joe McAdams

4451
03:48:21,375 --> 03:48:23,935
Headspace

4452
03:48:24,191 --> 03:48:25,471
He starts talking about races

4453
03:48:26,239 --> 03:48:28,031
And most of it is super unimportant

4454
03:48:28,543 --> 03:48:29,567
He's just saying that he isn't

4455
03:48:30,591 --> 03:48:31,103
And it's stupid

4456
03:48:31,615 --> 03:48:32,127
Videos

4457
03:48:33,151 --> 03:48:34,431
This is a big

4458
03:48:35,967 --> 03:48:38,783
Let's wrap this up

4459
03:48:39,039 --> 03:48:42,623
I don't know what it is

4460
03:48:42,879 --> 03:48:44,927
Oh you're a racist

4461
03:48:49,023 --> 03:48:55,167
Say your car someone is they are

4462
03:48:55,679 --> 03:48:56,959
Restaurants

4463
03:48:57,727 --> 03:49:03,871
Text & Beyond bike rack

4464
03:49:05,919 --> 03:49:12,063
Or because there is one

4465
03:49:12,319 --> 03:49:13,343
Mexican for 3 hours

4466
03:49:14,367 --> 03:49:16,927
A hundred percent believe in the tower real of Mexicans

4467
03:49:17,695 --> 03:49:18,207
I do too

4468
03:49:19,999 --> 03:49:20,767
Mexican food

4469
03:49:21,535 --> 03:49:22,815
Do you want that long pause there

4470
03:49:23,071 --> 03:49:24,607
That was because Alex was like

4471
03:49:24,863 --> 03:49:31,007
What are you talkin about you doesn't realize it's Bravo's

4472
03:49:31,263 --> 03:49:35,871
Next to a Mexican for 3 hours

4473
03:49:37,151 --> 03:49:37,919
You said wait

4474
03:49:38,943 --> 03:49:45,087
I don't think the pause is Alex feeling like I can't believe I sent next

4475
03:49:47,135 --> 03:49:47,647
Claritin

4476
03:49:47,903 --> 03:49:49,183
Justin being like I don't

4477
03:49:49,439 --> 03:49:50,463
What you're saying

4478
03:49:50,975 --> 03:49:51,743
I don't get

4479
03:49:53,023 --> 03:49:53,535
Processing

4480
03:49:54,047 --> 03:49:55,071
He's f****** soda

4481
03:49:55,327 --> 03:49:56,095
Drunken High

4482
03:49:56,351 --> 03:49:57,119
Billy

4483
03:49:57,375 --> 03:49:58,911
I'm not playing a ton of clips

4484
03:49:59,167 --> 03:49:59,935
From the end of this episode

4485
03:50:00,191 --> 03:50:01,727
Because it is so

4486
03:50:01,983 --> 03:50:02,495
Disaster

4487
03:50:03,263 --> 03:50:04,543
It's just them

4488
03:50:04,799 --> 03:50:05,567
2nd episode

4489
03:50:05,823 --> 03:50:07,103
And the natural rhythm

4490
03:50:07,359 --> 03:50:07,871
Are over

4491
03:50:08,127 --> 03:50:09,407
I meant Alex being like

4492
03:50:15,039 --> 03:50:17,087
The prop in order to start a conversation

4493
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:18,111
Like it's trash

4494
03:50:18,623 --> 03:50:19,135
It's awful

4495
03:50:19,903 --> 03:50:20,415
There is something

4496
03:50:21,439 --> 03:50:22,207
Ends up being discussed

4497
03:50:22,719 --> 03:50:23,999
That I think is very important

4498
03:50:27,839 --> 03:50:29,119
Use somebody pile drive to you

4499
03:50:29,375 --> 03:50:30,143
What happened

4500
03:50:31,423 --> 03:50:32,447
How old are you

4501
03:50:33,215 --> 03:50:39,359
1313

4502
03:50:40,895 --> 03:50:41,919
Wow

4503
03:50:42,943 --> 03:50:46,783
So was it a friend

4504
03:50:47,295 --> 03:50:50,367
And his cousin or something

4505
03:50:51,135 --> 03:50:53,695
You know Got Me Down

4506
03:50:53,951 --> 03:50:56,255
Here's a victim of racial attacks

4507
03:50:56,511 --> 03:50:57,279
I'm not like Jeffrey

4508
03:50:57,791 --> 03:50:58,815
Jussie Smollett

4509
03:50:59,071 --> 03:51:05,215
You literally said that you wrote the Mexican I got my leg broken being outside

4510
03:51:07,007 --> 03:51:13,151
Personality

4511
03:51:13,407 --> 03:51:16,991
Do you have any significant change

4512
03:51:17,503 --> 03:51:19,039
Sometimes juries

4513
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:20,063
Especially

4514
03:51:20,319 --> 03:51:22,367
It seems like

4515
03:51:22,879 --> 03:51:29,023
Real

4516
03:51:29,279 --> 03:51:34,143
Do we got to get to the route

4517
03:51:36,703 --> 03:51:39,007
Brain damage

4518
03:51:39,263 --> 03:51:39,775
There's no doubt

4519
03:51:40,031 --> 03:51:40,543
So I guess we can

4520
03:51:41,055 --> 03:51:41,823
Take that as a

4521
03:51:42,079 --> 03:51:43,103
Curiosity

4522
03:51:43,871 --> 03:51:44,383
Put check mark

4523
03:51:44,639 --> 03:51:49,759
And we definitely get rid of the probably there

4524
03:51:50,015 --> 03:51:52,319
The person that Alex is talking about who had medical copy

4525
03:51:52,831 --> 03:51:53,599
Translator that died

4526
03:51:54,111 --> 03:51:54,623
Possible

4527
03:51:54,879 --> 03:51:58,719
Yeah

4528
03:52:00,255 --> 03:52:01,023
Alright

4529
03:52:01,535 --> 03:52:03,071
But the other thing there is

4530
03:52:03,327 --> 03:52:03,839
The distance to be

4531
03:52:04,095 --> 03:52:05,119
F****** crystal clear

4532
03:52:05,631 --> 03:52:07,935
Joe is being like that's good timing

4533
03:52:08,191 --> 03:52:10,495
When Alex is his response

4534
03:52:10,751 --> 03:52:12,031
Your personality changes like

4535
03:52:12,287 --> 03:52:12,799
Who's all good for

4536
03:52:13,823 --> 03:52:14,847
I don't think that was a joke

4537
03:52:15,103 --> 03:52:15,871
I think it was Alex

4538
03:52:16,127 --> 03:52:16,639
Responding

4539
03:52:17,407 --> 03:52:18,687
Like in a dismissive

4540
03:52:18,943 --> 03:52:19,967
Kind of way

4541
03:52:20,479 --> 03:52:21,503
What he's asking me

4542
03:52:21,759 --> 03:52:22,271
Is

4543
03:52:22,527 --> 03:52:23,295
Threatening question

4544
03:52:23,551 --> 03:52:24,063
In some way

4545
03:52:24,575 --> 03:52:26,879
Because if I recognize the fact that

4546
03:52:27,391 --> 03:52:28,927
I got pile-driven on conch

4547
03:52:29,183 --> 03:52:29,695
Concrete when I was

4548
03:52:29,951 --> 03:52:30,463
13

4549
03:52:30,975 --> 03:52:32,255
How did the personality change

4550
03:52:32,511 --> 03:52:33,535
Cuz that is a very

4551
03:52:33,791 --> 03:52:34,303
Common

4552
03:52:34,559 --> 03:52:36,351
Right with severe brain

4553
03:52:36,607 --> 03:52:37,119
Trauma

4554
03:52:38,911 --> 03:52:39,679
Alex's I think

4555
03:52:39,935 --> 03:52:40,447
Dismissive

4556
03:52:40,703 --> 03:52:41,983
Answer the Joe is

4557
03:52:42,239 --> 03:52:42,751
Is a joke

4558
03:52:43,007 --> 03:52:43,519
It's not a joke

4559
03:52:43,775 --> 03:52:44,543
I want tell you this

4560
03:52:45,311 --> 03:52:47,615
The pile drivers actually moved

4561
03:52:47,871 --> 03:52:50,175
It's banned by the WWE here we go

4562
03:52:50,431 --> 03:52:55,039
If it's not performed the odds of it killing or paralyzing someone are really high

4563
03:52:55,551 --> 03:53:00,159
SummerSlam 1997 Owen Hart delivered a botched Piledriver to Stone Cold

4564
03:53:00,415 --> 03:53:00,927
Steve Austin

4565
03:53:01,183 --> 03:53:01,951
And broke his neck

4566
03:53:02,207 --> 03:53:02,975
In the middle of the match

4567
03:53:03,487 --> 03:53:05,023
Thankfully he was able to get surgery and

4568
03:53:05,279 --> 03:53:05,791
Recover from that

4569
03:53:06,047 --> 03:53:07,327
Guaranteed

4570
03:53:07,583 --> 03:53:08,863
Stone Cold career be cut

4571
03:53:09,119 --> 03:53:09,631
Way short

4572
03:53:10,399 --> 03:53:13,727
Most doctors who generally aren't thrilled to be asked to comment on this sort of thing

4573
03:53:13,983 --> 03:53:15,263
Agree that the pile driver

4574
03:53:15,519 --> 03:53:18,079
If it's delivered in a real-world scenario would almost

4575
03:53:18,335 --> 03:53:19,871
Definitely break a person's neck

4576
03:53:20,127 --> 03:53:21,919
And would very likely immediately

4577
03:53:22,175 --> 03:53:22,687
We kill them

4578
03:53:22,943 --> 03:53:26,015
The direct downward force would cause your spinal column to

4579
03:53:27,551 --> 03:53:28,831
So the odds are of

4580
03:53:29,087 --> 03:53:29,599
You not

4581
03:53:29,855 --> 03:53:31,647
Very least ending up paralyzed

4582
03:53:31,903 --> 03:53:32,927
Are very very

4583
03:53:33,695 --> 03:53:34,975
What Alex is describing

4584
03:53:35,231 --> 03:53:35,999
When is a situation

4585
03:53:37,023 --> 03:53:37,535
It doesn't

4586
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:40,351
Match with like the idea that you stood up

4587
03:53:42,143 --> 03:53:43,679
I don't know if this is true

4588
03:53:43,935 --> 03:53:48,543
It seems like it's not true or at least The Narrative of it seems not

4589
03:53:49,567 --> 03:53:52,895
Like combining two story

4590
03:53:53,151 --> 03:53:54,431
World

4591
03:53:54,687 --> 03:53:55,711
It is almost certainly

4592
03:53:55,967 --> 03:53:56,735
Exaggerating

4593
03:53:57,247 --> 03:53:59,807
Even if it even if the sequence of events that he's too

4594
03:54:00,063 --> 03:54:00,831
Describing happen

4595
03:54:01,343 --> 03:54:02,623
It wasn't that he got

4596
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:03,391
Full on

4597
03:54:03,647 --> 03:54:04,415
Piledriver

4598
03:54:04,671 --> 03:54:05,695
Write more like

4599
03:54:05,951 --> 03:54:06,719
He got

4600
03:54:06,975 --> 03:54:09,023
Thrown or whatever it is and he's been

4601
03:54:09,279 --> 03:54:10,303
Describing it as a pie

4602
03:54:11,583 --> 03:54:16,191
In order to kind of mental image

4603
03:54:16,447 --> 03:54:18,239
What he survived and end

4604
03:54:19,775 --> 03:54:23,615
In a superhuman way right

4605
03:54:24,895 --> 03:54:27,967
To the ground

4606
03:54:28,223 --> 03:54:30,015
Oh absolutely

4607
03:54:30,271 --> 03:54:32,063
To be like

4608
03:54:33,599 --> 03:54:34,111
8

4609
03:54:34,879 --> 03:54:35,391
I think that any

4610
03:54:35,647 --> 03:54:38,463
Anybody who talks about real fight in the real world

4611
03:54:38,719 --> 03:54:40,511
I think you have a responsibility

4612
03:54:41,535 --> 03:54:43,071
Piledriver comes up

4613
03:54:43,327 --> 03:54:45,375
Don't do that to people

4614
03:54:47,679 --> 03:54:49,727
Yeah

4615
03:54:49,983 --> 03:54:51,775
No his his argument would be

4616
03:54:52,031 --> 03:54:57,663
Don't do that to people because they might stand up and then punch you in the f****** throat that's Alex's exactly

4617
03:54:58,175 --> 03:55:00,735
Jesus

4618
03:55:00,991 --> 03:55:02,527
Preposition Earth proposition

4619
03:55:02,783 --> 03:55:04,063
And they're like you got pile-driven and

4620
03:55:04,319 --> 03:55:04,831
Man punches guy in

4621
03:55:06,879 --> 03:55:08,415
Whatever you interview accepted

4622
03:55:09,439 --> 03:55:10,975
Let's let's imagine let's stipulate

4623
03:55:12,511 --> 03:55:13,791
Experience

4624
03:55:15,071 --> 03:55:15,583
Is an imp

4625
03:55:17,119 --> 03:55:18,143
Like that is

4626
03:55:18,911 --> 03:55:22,495
Cuz this guy is the state wrestling champion

4627
03:55:22,751 --> 03:55:23,519
He's a muscle

4628
03:55:23,775 --> 03:55:25,311
We guy there's a lot of weight to it

4629
03:55:25,823 --> 03:55:28,639
So when you pile Drive someone part of the compression

4630
03:55:28,895 --> 03:55:29,407
Part of it

4631
03:55:29,663 --> 03:55:33,247
Is there weight coming along with your Waits falling down

4632
03:55:33,503 --> 03:55:35,039
And knocking your head into the ground

4633
03:55:35,551 --> 03:55:36,319
Covid-19

4634
03:55:36,575 --> 03:55:37,855
What is it it's someone

4635
03:55:38,367 --> 03:55:40,415
Who would be able to deliver that with

4636
03:55:40,671 --> 03:55:41,183
A ton of em

4637
03:55:41,951 --> 03:55:45,279
Right

4638
03:55:45,791 --> 03:55:46,303
State rest

4639
03:55:46,559 --> 03:55:48,095
When Champion not a professional wrestler

4640
03:55:48,351 --> 03:55:50,655
Would deliver a Piledriver have a good point

4641
03:55:51,679 --> 03:55:52,703
Kind

4642
03:55:53,727 --> 03:55:54,751
Who's wrestling move

4643
03:55:55,775 --> 03:55:56,287
You know

4644
03:55:56,543 --> 03:56:00,639
You in a Full Nelson

4645
03:56:00,895 --> 03:56:04,479
He wouldn't be like I saw this I saw the Undertaker do this like

4646
03:56:04,991 --> 03:56:05,503
F*** off

4647
03:56:06,271 --> 03:56:06,783
It is weird

4648
03:56:08,575 --> 03:56:10,111
It's true that what you have to come

4649
03:56:11,135 --> 03:56:11,903
Alex that is

4650
03:56:12,927 --> 03:56:13,439
Crazy

4651
03:56:13,695 --> 03:56:14,463
That is

4652
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:15,743
That is a trauma

4653
03:56:16,255 --> 03:56:17,791
People don't go through

4654
03:56:18,047 --> 03:56:19,583
Yeah

4655
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:20,351
This

4656
03:56:20,607 --> 03:56:23,423
Every bit of information we have about Alex

4657
03:56:23,679 --> 03:56:24,191
The childhood

4658
03:56:24,447 --> 03:56:25,215
From

4659
03:56:25,471 --> 03:56:28,031
I'm basically every stories ever told about his childhood

4660
03:56:34,943 --> 03:56:35,711
From so many serial

4661
03:56:37,759 --> 03:56:40,575
I've experienced nothing but non-stop prom

4662
03:56:41,343 --> 03:56:44,927
Until I was killing people

4663
03:56:45,439 --> 03:56:46,463
But for him it's like

4664
03:56:47,487 --> 03:56:51,327
There's literally nothing that you can describe his childhood as

4665
03:56:51,583 --> 03:56:52,095
Other than

4666
03:56:52,607 --> 03:56:54,655
A Non-Stop

4667
03:56:54,911 --> 03:56:55,935
Combination of

4668
03:56:56,191 --> 03:56:57,215
Statutory rape

4669
03:57:00,287 --> 03:57:02,847
Goddamn mind control games by his dad

4670
03:57:03,103 --> 03:57:05,663
And then now physical

4671
03:57:06,943 --> 03:57:10,783
F*** emotionally threatening situations

4672
03:57:11,039 --> 03:57:12,063
Whether it be

4673
03:57:12,319 --> 03:57:13,599
Believing

4674
03:57:15,647 --> 03:57:16,671
Document to ascertain

4675
03:57:16,927 --> 03:57:18,463
I called

4676
03:57:19,999 --> 03:57:20,511
On

4677
03:57:20,767 --> 03:57:22,559
Look No Boundaries that

4678
03:57:22,815 --> 03:57:23,327
Situations

4679
03:57:23,583 --> 03:57:24,095
But he finds himself

4680
03:57:28,703 --> 03:57:31,007
I don't think I necessarily believe any of

4681
03:57:31,263 --> 03:57:31,775
What's the details

4682
03:57:32,031 --> 03:57:33,055
Of course not

4683
03:57:33,311 --> 03:57:35,103
No but if you take him at what

4684
03:57:36,383 --> 03:57:37,663
If you believe him

4685
03:57:38,943 --> 03:57:40,223
This is a really really

4686
03:57:40,479 --> 03:57:42,015
The portrait that he's painting of his younger

4687
03:57:42,271 --> 03:57:43,295
He's

4688
03:57:44,063 --> 03:57:45,087
Exactly the rest

4689
03:57:45,599 --> 03:57:46,367
Refer someone

4690
03:57:46,623 --> 03:57:47,391
Who needs

4691
03:57:47,903 --> 03:57:49,695
Yeah it's not somebody who's

4692
03:57:49,951 --> 03:57:50,463
Funny

4693
03:57:50,719 --> 03:57:51,999
It's not somebody who has

4694
03:57:52,511 --> 03:57:54,047
You can last at Houk

4695
03:57:54,303 --> 03:57:55,839
See he is around

4696
03:57:56,095 --> 03:57:57,631
And if you don't believe

4697
03:57:57,887 --> 03:57:58,399
Leave him

4698
03:57:59,679 --> 03:58:00,447
Kind of weird

4699
03:58:00,959 --> 03:58:02,495
Because I was lying

4700
03:58:04,031 --> 03:58:07,103
Image that their childhood was the sort of thing

4701
03:58:07,359 --> 03:58:08,383
That would require

4702
03:58:09,151 --> 03:58:10,431
Decades of therapy

4703
03:58:10,687 --> 03:58:12,223
In order to get you to be able to integrate this

4704
03:58:12,735 --> 03:58:14,015
Healthy life

4705
03:58:14,271 --> 03:58:15,295
Yeah

4706
03:58:15,807 --> 03:58:16,319
It's kind of like

4707
03:58:16,575 --> 03:58:19,647
I don't know what you're getting out of ragging it embellishment

4708
03:58:19,903 --> 03:58:20,927
These stories that are.

4709
03:58:21,439 --> 03:58:21,951
We f***** up

4710
03:58:23,231 --> 03:58:27,071
I don't know I just wanted I just want to be clear that I don't believe this stuff

4711
03:58:27,583 --> 03:58:30,143
Just because he's saying I'm not getting

4712
03:58:30,399 --> 03:58:32,191
Trick by like some sort of

4713
03:58:32,447 --> 03:58:33,215
You know a goof

4714
03:58:35,263 --> 03:58:36,031
If you do believe it

4715
03:58:36,287 --> 03:58:37,311
This is very serious

4716
03:58:38,079 --> 03:58:38,847
That's what I'm saying

4717
03:58:39,103 --> 03:58:42,943
I don't believe the details of what he's

4718
03:58:43,967 --> 03:58:44,991
But I do believe

4719
03:58:45,247 --> 03:58:47,039
In the overall trauma

4720
03:58:47,295 --> 03:58:49,599
Of what he's

4721
03:58:49,855 --> 03:58:51,647
Yeah

4722
03:58:52,159 --> 03:58:53,951
Yeah go to some

4723
03:58:55,231 --> 03:58:57,535
Senior in high school house in a Mercedes

4724
03:58:58,047 --> 03:59:01,375
And get injected into a satanic cult by killing knock

4725
03:59:01,631 --> 03:59:03,423
I don't think that that's not true

4726
03:59:03,679 --> 03:59:04,447
But I do think

4727
03:59:04,703 --> 03:59:05,471
Something

4728
03:59:05,727 --> 03:59:07,007
Happened

4729
03:59:07,263 --> 03:59:11,359
Wherein he got really traumatized at a very young age

4730
03:59:11,615 --> 03:59:17,759
In a way that is a far lower States version of that

4731
03:59:18,015 --> 03:59:19,295
Person at likes

4732
03:59:19,551 --> 03:59:20,831
Some sort of a church that

4733
03:59:21,087 --> 03:59:24,927
It was a little bit weird and they wanted him to

4734
03:59:25,183 --> 03:59:26,719
Youth group or something like that and he's

4735
03:59:27,231 --> 03:59:29,535
Is that story whatever emotions he felt

4736
03:59:29,791 --> 03:59:30,303
Threatened

4737
03:59:30,559 --> 03:59:31,327
In that

4738
03:59:31,583 --> 03:59:36,703
In that moment when they like you should be a part of our group but they give a lot to offer whatever

4739
03:59:36,959 --> 03:59:38,239
That that's entirely possible

4740
03:59:38,751 --> 03:59:40,799
I don't know I think we drift into you like

4741
03:59:41,311 --> 03:59:42,079
The possibility of

4742
03:59:42,847 --> 03:59:44,127
Irresponsibly psychoanalyze

4743
03:59:44,895 --> 03:59:46,687
I know you're saying is appropriate

4744
03:59:47,199 --> 03:59:48,479
But if we get more specific

4745
03:59:52,063 --> 03:59:52,831
Feeling very hard

4746
03:59:53,087 --> 03:59:54,623
That does describe trauma

4747
03:59:54,879 --> 03:59:55,647
The details

4748
03:59:55,903 --> 03:59:57,695
Who f****** know whatever happened

4749
03:59:58,207 --> 03:59:59,231
This guy was traumatized

4750
03:59:59,999 --> 04:00:04,607
Whatever his details are are secondary to the fact that he is describing

4751
04:00:05,119 --> 04:00:07,679
A very real trauma that he experienced

4752
04:00:08,191 --> 04:00:12,799
Regardless of a group

4753
04:00:13,311 --> 04:00:18,943
You know or tearing in a biography of

4754
04:00:22,015 --> 04:00:23,295
Deeply troubling stuff

4755
04:00:24,319 --> 04:00:24,831
I don't know why

4756
04:00:25,087 --> 04:00:25,599
You want that to be

4757
04:00:25,855 --> 04:00:26,367
His backstory

4758
04:00:26,623 --> 04:00:27,135
It's not true

4759
04:00:27,391 --> 04:00:27,903
Yeah

4760
04:00:28,159 --> 04:00:28,671
Better now

4761
04:00:29,183 --> 04:00:29,695
Because life is just

4762
04:00:30,207 --> 04:00:35,327
For boring I mean I guess he could be from a from a standpoint

4763
04:00:35,583 --> 04:00:36,095
Could be

4764
04:00:36,351 --> 04:00:37,375
Trying to elicit

4765
04:00:38,143 --> 04:00:38,655
You know like

4766
04:00:38,911 --> 04:00:41,471
Look at look at how f*****-up my childhood was

4767
04:00:41,727 --> 04:00:43,519
But then I don't understand

4768
04:00:43,775 --> 04:00:45,567
A patent office bragging

4769
04:00:45,823 --> 04:00:50,175
Aggressive

4770
04:00:51,711 --> 04:00:52,479
It's just macula

4771
04:00:52,735 --> 04:00:53,247
Posturing

4772
04:00:53,503 --> 04:00:54,015
And a lot of it

4773
04:00:54,271 --> 04:00:56,319
Like at its core like a lot of those stories

4774
04:00:56,575 --> 04:00:57,855
Even the ones by like

4775
04:00:58,367 --> 04:00:59,647
Does prabhas f****** the seven

4776
04:00:59,903 --> 04:01:01,183
13 Gibraltar

4777
04:01:01,439 --> 04:01:02,463
The macho posturing

4778
04:01:04,767 --> 04:01:05,791
It's a high-school kid reflux

4779
04:01:06,047 --> 04:01:06,815
The teacher and everybody gives

4780
04:01:07,327 --> 04:01:08,351
Hi-5 and you're like no that's

4781
04:01:09,119 --> 04:01:09,631
But Depot

4782
04:01:09,887 --> 04:01:10,655
We f***** up bright

4783
04:01:10,911 --> 04:01:11,679
Answer this next clip

4784
04:01:13,215 --> 04:01:18,079
Aregularguy

4785
04:01:21,407 --> 04:01:23,711
I would like a bunch of people

4786
04:01:23,967 --> 04:01:24,479
It's like

4787
04:01:25,247 --> 04:01:25,759
Darth Vader

4788
04:01:26,271 --> 04:01:30,111
Darth Vader

4789
04:01:30,367 --> 04:01:30,879
Fight

4790
04:01:31,903 --> 04:01:35,231
I was a kid

4791
04:01:42,655 --> 04:01:43,167
That's gross

4792
04:01:44,191 --> 04:01:45,215
That is

4793
04:01:46,751 --> 04:01:47,519
2 problems

4794
04:01:47,775 --> 04:01:49,823
The first thing

4795
04:01:52,127 --> 04:01:55,711
You said the first time I bash someone's head to the concrete which applies there was nothing

4796
04:01:55,967 --> 04:01:56,991
Oh yeah not just

4797
04:01:57,247 --> 04:01:58,271
That one time I did

4798
04:01:58,783 --> 04:02:00,575
Evan second because I got higher than

4799
04:02:00,831 --> 04:02:01,343
Inhale

4800
04:02:02,623 --> 04:02:03,135
I got

4801
04:02:03,391 --> 04:02:03,903
I got it

4802
04:02:05,695 --> 04:02:06,975
Villanova drug Xperia

4803
04:02:07,487 --> 04:02:08,511
Off closet

4804
04:02:08,767 --> 04:02:09,535
Pain to somebody

4805
04:02:10,047 --> 04:02:12,351
Concrete

4806
04:02:12,607 --> 04:02:13,375
I felt

4807
04:02:16,191 --> 04:02:19,007
I felt like I got you an elevated state by causing

4808
04:02:19,263 --> 04:02:20,031
Movies playing

4809
04:02:20,287 --> 04:02:21,055
That is

4810
04:02:22,847 --> 04:02:24,127
David David Wong

4811
04:02:24,383 --> 04:02:25,407
Wrote a book

4812
04:02:25,663 --> 04:02:26,175
Call.

4813
04:02:26,431 --> 04:02:27,199
Futuristic violence

4814
04:02:27,967 --> 04:02:28,479
T suits

4815
04:02:28,735 --> 04:02:32,063
I really love that book

4816
04:02:32,319 --> 04:02:33,855
And the main villain in that book

4817
04:02:34,367 --> 04:02:36,159
Is just the essential Ave

4818
04:02:36,415 --> 04:02:37,183
Avatar

4819
04:02:37,439 --> 04:02:37,951
Toxic mask

4820
04:02:38,207 --> 04:02:38,719
Masculinity

4821
04:02:38,975 --> 04:02:39,487
And his

4822
04:02:39,743 --> 04:02:41,279
Huge deal is just

4823
04:02:41,791 --> 04:02:42,815
By this

4824
04:02:43,327 --> 04:02:43,839
Violent

4825
04:02:45,887 --> 04:02:46,399
Bulshit

4826
04:02:46,655 --> 04:02:49,215
Masculinity ideology that I have

4827
04:02:49,727 --> 04:02:50,751
I feel the juice

4828
04:02:51,007 --> 04:02:51,519
I feel the edge

4829
04:02:51,775 --> 04:02:53,055
Adrenaline

4830
04:02:53,311 --> 04:02:55,359
Greater than any feeling in the world and I'm

4831
04:02:55,615 --> 04:02:59,711
I'm destroying the week in order for the the true Superstar

4832
04:02:59,967 --> 04:03:02,527
Society to be built entirely around the adrenal

4833
04:03:03,295 --> 04:03:04,575
And eats like crap

4834
04:03:04,831 --> 04:03:05,599
Yeah it's just

4835
04:03:05,855 --> 04:03:06,367
F******

4836
04:03:06,623 --> 04:03:07,135
Disgusting

4837
04:03:07,903 --> 04:03:08,415
It is

4838
04:03:08,671 --> 04:03:09,183
Just

4839
04:03:15,583 --> 04:03:19,423
The point is they're going through all the like he's

4840
04:03:19,935 --> 04:03:21,983
He's being described in his actions are

4841
04:03:22,239 --> 04:03:22,751
Such that

4842
04:03:23,263 --> 04:03:25,055
It cannot be more obvious

4843
04:03:25,567 --> 04:03:26,079
That pictures

4844
04:03:26,847 --> 04:03:27,359
Masculinity

4845
04:03:32,735 --> 04:03:33,503
280

4846
04:03:34,271 --> 04:03:36,575
I don't know what to do with those sorts of things like

4847
04:03:36,831 --> 04:03:37,599
Get really tough

4848
04:03:37,855 --> 04:03:38,367
Because like

4849
04:03:39,135 --> 04:03:40,159
I mean I don't know

4850
04:03:40,415 --> 04:03:41,439
There's a world that

4851
04:03:41,695 --> 04:03:42,207
Exist

4852
04:03:44,767 --> 04:03:45,279
Who's making all the

4853
04:03:49,631 --> 04:03:52,959
The concrete he talks about it a lot and talk about it

4854
04:03:53,215 --> 04:03:53,727
So like

4855
04:03:54,239 --> 04:03:55,775
If possible he's making that up

4856
04:03:56,543 --> 04:03:57,311
If he isn't

4857
04:03:57,823 --> 04:03:58,591
He's describing

4858
04:03:59,615 --> 04:04:01,151
Taking great pleasure from do

4859
04:04:01,919 --> 04:04:02,687
Which I f***

4860
04:04:04,479 --> 04:04:05,247
He's making it up

4861
04:04:05,503 --> 04:04:09,087
He's making it up in service of saying that he got great pleasure from it

4862
04:04:09,343 --> 04:04:10,367
Which I also hate

4863
04:04:10,623 --> 04:04:12,671
Because that's also part of his brain

4864
04:04:13,183 --> 04:04:16,511
Then he's imagining what it would be like to be on the concrete

4865
04:04:16,767 --> 04:04:17,791
And thinking I probably

4866
04:04:18,047 --> 04:04:21,887
Getting really high doing

4867
04:04:22,143 --> 04:04:23,679
There's no way around that the Dozen

4868
04:04:23,935 --> 04:04:24,959
Describe someone who is

4869
04:04:25,471 --> 04:04:26,495
Deeply Disturbed

4870
04:04:26,751 --> 04:04:27,775
Yeah

4871
04:04:28,031 --> 04:04:29,567
Even if it's in self-defense

4872
04:04:30,335 --> 04:04:31,359
Like I understand

4873
04:04:31,615 --> 04:04:32,639
Punching somebody

4874
04:04:32,895 --> 04:04:33,407
Is there, yet

4875
04:04:33,919 --> 04:04:34,687
Or whatever

4876
04:04:34,943 --> 04:04:38,015
I'm not going to I'm not going to I hate violence in all its forms

4877
04:04:38,271 --> 04:04:39,295
But I'm not going to the

4878
04:04:39,807 --> 04:04:41,343
Say like self-defense is bad

4879
04:04:41,599 --> 04:04:43,647
Or anything like that well if you're Christian

4880
04:04:43,903 --> 04:04:46,207
There's that whole turn the other cheek

4881
04:04:46,719 --> 04:04:47,231
Right

4882
04:04:47,487 --> 04:04:49,279
Look

4883
04:04:52,607 --> 04:04:53,119
I don't

4884
04:04:53,631 --> 04:04:54,143
There's any Circle

4885
04:04:54,655 --> 04:04:55,423
That's where you're banging

4886
04:04:57,215 --> 04:04:58,495
That is justifiable

4887
04:05:00,031 --> 04:05:00,543
I don't believe

4888
04:05:01,567 --> 04:05:02,079
And then

4889
04:05:02,591 --> 04:05:04,127
Imagining or haven't

4890
04:05:04,383 --> 04:05:04,895
Response

4891
04:05:05,151 --> 04:05:06,687
Did you get high and enjoy it

4892
04:05:07,199 --> 04:05:07,967
Is just your monster

4893
04:05:08,479 --> 04:05:09,503
Absolutely disgusting

4894
04:05:09,759 --> 04:05:12,831
Real or not you are a real or not monster

4895
04:05:16,159 --> 04:05:17,183
Yeah bro

4896
04:05:17,439 --> 04:05:18,207
I-88

4897
04:05:18,719 --> 04:05:19,487
Enough

4898
04:05:19,743 --> 04:05:21,023
Years into this where

4899
04:05:21,279 --> 04:05:22,815
It does kind of seem as though

4900
04:05:24,351 --> 04:05:26,399
Our least I feel like I have a certain

4901
04:05:26,655 --> 04:05:27,167
Can handle on

4902
04:05:27,935 --> 04:05:29,215
When Alex is

4903
04:05:29,983 --> 04:05:31,263
Making something of whole cloth

4904
04:05:31,519 --> 04:05:32,543
Write and when

4905
04:05:32,799 --> 04:05:35,615
He is exaggerating something they did

4906
04:05:35,871 --> 04:05:36,639
Yeah exactly

4907
04:05:37,151 --> 04:05:38,175
There is something

4908
04:05:38,687 --> 04:05:40,223
Too many of these stories

4909
04:05:40,735 --> 04:05:41,247
Trauma

4910
04:05:41,503 --> 04:05:42,015
Did

4911
04:05:42,271 --> 04:05:44,319
Happened I don't know the details

4912
04:05:44,575 --> 04:05:46,367
It's not it's not the same as what he's making

4913
04:05:46,623 --> 04:05:47,135
He's like my

4914
04:05:47,391 --> 04:05:48,927
My grandpa was German

4915
04:05:50,719 --> 04:05:55,327
Yeah if he was completely made up there would be either the

4916
04:05:55,839 --> 04:05:57,631
I don't want to get into it

4917
04:05:57,887 --> 04:05:59,423
And I'll leave it as like a

4918
04:06:01,727 --> 04:06:03,519
Hyper detailed like

4919
04:06:07,871 --> 04:06:10,687
To the concrete I remember because he was wearing a nose

4920
04:06:11,711 --> 04:06:13,759
T-shirts and blue jeans shorts

4921
04:06:14,015 --> 04:06:16,319
Send you know there would be those hyper-specific

4922
04:06:16,575 --> 04:06:17,087
Take details

4923
04:06:17,343 --> 04:06:19,391
They kind of tell you you're just f***

4924
04:06:19,647 --> 04:06:20,159
And making this s***

4925
04:06:20,671 --> 04:06:22,207
He's done that on some occasions

4926
04:06:22,719 --> 04:06:23,487
Some of his violent stories

4927
04:06:23,743 --> 04:06:24,255
He's on his own show

4928
04:06:24,767 --> 04:06:25,279
He's not doing it

4929
04:06:25,535 --> 04:06:26,815
Here on this Epic

4930
04:06:28,863 --> 04:06:29,631
Stick is really

4931
04:06:29,887 --> 04:06:30,911
Important

4932
04:06:31,423 --> 04:06:32,703
He's telling he's really f*****

4933
04:06:32,959 --> 04:06:33,471
Top stories

4934
04:06:35,519 --> 04:06:36,031
Kind of owner

4935
04:06:36,543 --> 04:06:38,079
The idea that there f*****-up

4936
04:06:43,967 --> 04:06:44,479
After

4937
04:06:45,247 --> 04:06:46,527
Like two clips prior I believe

4938
04:06:46,783 --> 04:06:47,295
He said

4939
04:06:47,551 --> 04:06:48,831
I'm brain damaged

4940
04:06:49,087 --> 04:06:49,855
There's no doubt about it

4941
04:06:50,111 --> 04:06:50,623
Yeah

4942
04:06:51,391 --> 04:06:53,439
When the kid dropped you on your head

4943
04:06:53,695 --> 04:06:55,487
What effect did it have on you physically

4944
04:06:55,743 --> 04:06:57,279
It was by the field house

4945
04:06:57,791 --> 04:06:59,839
Cuz it's cousin attack man I beam up

4946
04:07:00,863 --> 04:07:03,935
Wesley Chapel

4947
04:07:20,575 --> 04:07:21,343
When I got up

4948
04:07:22,879 --> 04:07:24,415
He couldn't understand why

4949
04:07:24,671 --> 04:07:25,695
Energetic

4950
04:07:26,719 --> 04:07:29,023
Equivalence

4951
04:07:29,279 --> 04:07:30,559
You don't understand being the hammer

4952
04:07:32,607 --> 04:07:35,679
Anime

4953
04:07:38,495 --> 04:07:41,055
What happened after that

4954
04:07:42,591 --> 04:07:43,871
I mean I lost

4955
04:07:47,455 --> 04:07:49,247
I love you slam I have the ground

4956
04:07:49,503 --> 04:07:51,807
The concrete crack

4957
04:07:52,063 --> 04:07:54,111
She was like only as bottagra

4958
04:08:04,863 --> 04:08:05,887
Know that story

4959
04:08:07,679 --> 04:08:08,959
Did you go to the hospital

4960
04:08:14,079 --> 04:08:15,359
They didn't check your head

4961
04:08:15,615 --> 04:08:17,919
Do you telling me that pile trap

4962
04:08:18,175 --> 04:08:19,711
Episode 11 in the gym

4963
04:08:20,735 --> 04:08:24,831
Reading my check to see if you have a severe concussion or anything

4964
04:08:27,391 --> 04:08:28,159
I mean I don't know

4965
04:08:29,183 --> 04:08:29,695
That's f*****

4966
04:08:31,999 --> 04:08:32,767
I don't believe the concrete

4967
04:08:33,023 --> 04:08:33,791
Broke

4968
04:08:34,047 --> 04:08:35,839
His head was split open any of that stuff

4969
04:08:36,095 --> 04:08:36,863
Because the force that

4970
04:08:37,119 --> 04:08:37,887
It would be required for

4971
04:08:38,143 --> 04:08:38,655
Either of those things

4972
04:08:38,911 --> 04:08:39,423
What happened

4973
04:08:39,679 --> 04:08:40,191
Would probably

4974
04:08:40,959 --> 04:08:41,727
From that

4975
04:08:41,983 --> 04:08:42,495
Maneuver

4976
04:08:42,751 --> 04:08:43,775
Now that it's just

4977
04:08:44,287 --> 04:08:45,823
It's just hero story invalid

4978
04:08:46,335 --> 04:08:46,847
Yeah

4979
04:08:47,359 --> 04:08:47,871
But he's

4980
04:08:48,127 --> 04:08:48,639
Presenting

4981
04:08:49,151 --> 04:08:49,663
Freeware

4982
04:08:49,919 --> 04:08:50,431
He didn't have

4983
04:08:51,455 --> 04:08:52,479
Hospital they didn't check

4984
04:08:52,735 --> 04:08:53,503
Checking for a concussion

4985
04:08:54,015 --> 04:08:56,831
He just went to jail they stowed him up and then let him go

4986
04:08:58,111 --> 04:08:58,879
If that is

4987
04:08:59,391 --> 04:08:59,903
Reality

4988
04:09:00,159 --> 04:09:01,183
This is

4989
04:09:02,463 --> 04:09:02,975
Huge turd

4990
04:09:04,255 --> 04:09:06,303
Yeah even if the key is broken

4991
04:09:06,559 --> 04:09:08,095
Even in the eighties

4992
04:09:09,375 --> 04:09:11,167
Which is around when this would be happening

4993
04:09:11,679 --> 04:09:12,703
Even then

4994
04:09:14,751 --> 04:09:15,775
You would still at

4995
04:09:16,031 --> 04:09:18,847
Go to the hospital if you were bleeding

4996
04:09:19,103 --> 04:09:19,615
Profusely

4997
04:09:19,871 --> 04:09:20,639
And required

4998
04:09:20,895 --> 04:09:21,407
Stitches

4999
04:09:22,175 --> 04:09:23,967
So the story being that he went

5000
04:09:24,223 --> 04:09:25,247
Straight to jail

5001
04:09:26,271 --> 04:09:27,295
I'd suggest otherwise

5002
04:09:28,063 --> 04:09:31,903
Kind of a kind of suggests that he's making up a little bit of this whole it

5003
04:09:32,415 --> 04:09:32,927
Entirely

5004
04:09:34,463 --> 04:09:35,487
I mean baby who knows

5005
04:09:37,279 --> 04:09:38,559
Pull-A-Part's

5006
04:09:43,935 --> 04:09:44,447
There's a lot of this here

5007
04:09:45,215 --> 04:09:45,727
Nonsense

5008
04:09:47,775 --> 04:09:48,287
Earlier

5009
04:09:48,543 --> 04:09:49,823
We heard him talk about this

5010
04:09:51,103 --> 04:09:51,615
Going around with when he

5011
04:09:53,407 --> 04:09:54,175
Who choked him out

5012
04:09:54,687 --> 04:09:55,199
The first time you got

5013
04:09:55,967 --> 04:09:57,247
But turns out

5014
04:09:57,759 --> 04:09:58,527
Used to choke each other out

5015
04:09:58,783 --> 04:09:59,551
The fun quite a bit

5016
04:09:59,807 --> 04:10:00,319
I did that

5017
04:10:00,575 --> 04:10:01,855
I've heard this from a lot of people

5018
04:10:02,367 --> 04:10:03,647
This is not part of my childhood

5019
04:10:03,903 --> 04:10:04,415
But I've heard it

5020
04:10:04,671 --> 04:10:05,439
The number of times

5021
04:10:05,951 --> 04:10:06,975
This clip

5022
04:10:07,231 --> 04:10:07,743
Is so f*****

5023
04:10:08,255 --> 04:10:09,023
Cuz he's talking about it

5024
04:10:09,279 --> 04:10:10,047
Scrying

5025
04:10:10,559 --> 04:10:11,327
Talking about

5026
04:10:11,583 --> 04:10:12,095
The memory

5027
04:10:12,863 --> 04:10:14,399
Of being choked out by his friend lost

5028
04:10:14,655 --> 04:10:15,167
4

5029
04:10:15,935 --> 04:10:19,519
Didn't you say that when your friends are choke you out you that was his long dreams

5030
04:10:35,135 --> 04:10:37,183
I have three lights

5031
04:10:37,439 --> 04:10:38,207
What time I

5032
04:10:40,255 --> 04:10:43,839
They choke me out also

5033
04:10:44,351 --> 04:10:46,143
Horse

5034
04:10:46,655 --> 04:10:47,423
Evan White

5035
04:10:50,239 --> 04:10:52,543
Thousands of years ago

5036
04:10:52,799 --> 04:10:54,079
Lifetime lights

5037
04:10:54,335 --> 04:10:56,895
Am I growing food

5038
04:10:59,711 --> 04:11:00,479
It was like

5039
04:11:01,503 --> 04:11:03,039
Just a moment

5040
04:11:04,575 --> 04:11:05,855
Kids everything

5041
04:11:09,183 --> 04:11:10,719
Kids

5042
04:11:10,975 --> 04:11:12,511
And get starving

5043
04:11:13,023 --> 04:11:19,167
People attacking us do you think all that information from your ancestors somehow or another encoded somewhere in the car

5044
04:11:20,703 --> 04:11:21,215
That's

5045
04:11:21,471 --> 04:11:22,495
So f***** up

5046
04:11:23,519 --> 04:11:25,567
Here is what I will say

5047
04:11:29,663 --> 04:11:32,735
So this wasn't a thing like when I was working at God can

5048
04:11:35,551 --> 04:11:36,575
And it was

5049
04:11:36,831 --> 04:11:37,343
God can

5050
04:11:37,855 --> 04:11:38,367
So

5051
04:11:38,623 --> 04:11:40,415
I was there for a full month

5052
04:11:40,927 --> 04:11:41,439
Or whatever and

5053
04:11:41,695 --> 04:11:42,463
That was living in the

5054
04:11:43,231 --> 04:11:44,511
Little cabin bulshit

5055
04:11:44,767 --> 04:11:46,559
It's with other people around by

5056
04:11:48,095 --> 04:11:49,631
Some of whom brought this whole thing up

5057
04:11:50,399 --> 04:11:52,191
Hangouts

5058
04:11:52,703 --> 04:11:53,727
And I remembered

5059
04:11:54,239 --> 04:11:56,543
I remember doing it and

5060
04:11:56,799 --> 04:11:59,359
One time I do remember this feeling

5061
04:11:59,615 --> 04:12:00,127
Like

5062
04:12:00,383 --> 04:12:02,943
I woke up and I felt like I had lived in

5063
04:12:03,199 --> 04:12:03,711
An entire differ

5064
04:12:04,735 --> 04:12:08,575
Like I remember there being a different thing or whatever it was

5065
04:12:09,087 --> 04:12:12,927
Not going to cry about it before like

5066
04:12:13,183 --> 04:12:14,975
Weather

5067
04:12:15,487 --> 04:12:16,511
Specific alucinacion

5068
04:12:16,767 --> 04:12:18,047
You have

5069
04:12:18,303 --> 04:12:18,815
Waking up

5070
04:12:19,071 --> 04:12:21,375
From being choked out with like a euphoric state

5071
04:12:21,631 --> 04:12:22,399
Yeah I heard that

5072
04:12:22,655 --> 04:12:24,447
People who are into like

5073
04:12:24,703 --> 04:12:26,495
Like

5074
04:12:26,751 --> 04:12:30,591
Play Within sexuality there is

5075
04:12:30,847 --> 04:12:31,871
To get choked out

5076
04:12:32,127 --> 04:12:32,639
Pleasurable

5077
04:12:33,151 --> 04:12:33,663
Experience

5078
04:12:33,919 --> 04:12:35,455
Controlled environment

5079
04:12:35,711 --> 04:12:38,527
And I'm not going to judge that I am going to Judge Alex

5080
04:12:40,575 --> 04:12:44,415
Political commentator

5081
04:12:44,671 --> 04:12:45,695
Coming on Joe Rogan

5082
04:12:45,951 --> 04:12:46,463
In the show

5083
04:12:46,975 --> 04:12:48,511

5085
04:12:50,303 --> 04:12:50,815
Pretending

Esoteric spiritual truth

5087
04:12:56,191 --> 04:12:57,727
To him and his body is choking

5088
04:12:57,983 --> 04:12:58,751
Route

5089
04:12:59,007 --> 04:13:00,799
And then

5090
04:13:01,055 --> 04:13:04,383
His children starving to death and living as a farmer

5091
04:13:04,639 --> 04:13:05,663
Yeah

5092
04:13:07,199 --> 04:13:08,223
It's insane like

5093
04:13:08,479 --> 04:13:09,247
Yeah I don't

5094
04:13:09,759 --> 04:13:11,807

5095
04:13:13,087 --> 04:13:13,599
Response

5096
04:13:14,111 --> 04:13:15,135
You really think that

5097
04:13:15,391 --> 04:13:15,903
People are

5098
04:13:16,159 --> 04:13:16,671
You know like your aunt

5099
04:13:21,535 --> 04:13:23,327
There's so many points when you should hit

5100
04:13:23,583 --> 04:13:24,095
The eject but

5101
04:13:24,607 --> 04:13:25,631
Yeah I love this like

5102
04:13:26,399 --> 04:13:28,959
I'm across the table with a lunatic

5103
04:13:29,471 --> 04:13:31,775
Right I thought we had a friendship

5104
04:13:32,799 --> 04:13:34,591
He said he was going to politically

5105
04:13:35,103 --> 04:13:35,871
Hang me up like a

5106
04:13:36,127 --> 04:13:37,151
The pig and slit my throat

5107
04:13:37,407 --> 04:13:40,479
Right and I don't know how you could do that

5108
04:13:40,735 --> 04:13:41,759
JoJo rabbit

5109
04:13:42,015 --> 04:13:43,295
Politically

5110
04:13:43,807 --> 04:13:45,599
We made we made peace with

5111
04:13:45,855 --> 04:13:47,391
This long conversation on the phone that we

5112
04:13:47,647 --> 04:13:48,159
We had

5113
04:13:48,671 --> 04:13:50,463
He pretended to apologize for Sandy Hook

5114
04:13:50,975 --> 04:13:51,999
I didn't realize you was lying to me

5115
04:13:52,255 --> 04:13:53,023
Through most of that

5116
04:13:53,535 --> 04:13:54,559
Who's had a very weird

5117
04:13:55,071 --> 04:13:56,607
Conversation that is going to bunch of places

5118
04:13:57,119 --> 04:13:57,887
Now he's high

5119
04:13:58,399 --> 04:13:59,167
He's telling me about all this

5120
04:13:59,423 --> 04:14:01,983
Brain trauma that he f****** had from when he was younger

5121
04:14:02,239 --> 04:14:04,031
Yeah

5122
04:14:04,287 --> 04:14:04,799
Choke him out

5123
04:14:05,055 --> 04:14:05,567
You loved it

5124
04:14:05,823 --> 04:14:09,663
Edit connected him with his ancestors

5125
04:14:10,943 --> 04:14:11,455
I wish

5126
04:14:11,711 --> 04:14:12,735
There was an opportunity

5127
04:14:13,247 --> 04:14:13,759
For him to

5128
04:14:14,271 --> 04:14:15,039
Actually have

5129
04:14:15,551 --> 04:14:16,575
I wouldn't say backbone

5130
04:14:16,831 --> 04:14:17,343
That's not

5131
04:14:17,855 --> 04:14:18,623
Because Joe is

5132
04:14:19,391 --> 04:14:20,159
You know he has back

5133
04:14:20,671 --> 04:14:21,951
If he wanted to

5134
04:14:22,207 --> 04:14:22,719
Could have

5135
04:14:22,975 --> 04:14:23,743
Push back against our

5136
04:14:24,255 --> 04:14:24,767
Exact

5137
04:14:25,023 --> 04:14:25,535
Curly Howard

5138
04:14:26,303 --> 04:14:27,327
Right like it's not that easy

5139
04:14:27,583 --> 04:14:28,095
Coward

5140
04:14:30,399 --> 04:14:31,423
He doesn't have the wherewithal

5141
04:14:31,679 --> 04:14:32,447
Even if the present

5142
04:14:32,959 --> 04:14:33,471
Automotive

5143
04:14:34,239 --> 04:14:34,751
And he should

5144
04:14:35,519 --> 04:14:37,055
Because what Alex is describing

5145
04:14:39,103 --> 04:14:39,615
If wife

5146
04:14:39,871 --> 04:14:40,383
Unchecked

5147
04:14:41,407 --> 04:14:42,175
Appears to

5148
04:14:42,687 --> 04:14:43,199
Normal

5149
04:14:43,711 --> 04:14:44,479
For Heroic

5150
04:14:44,991 --> 04:14:45,503
4 funny

5151
04:14:46,527 --> 04:14:47,039
Any of those

5152
04:14:48,831 --> 04:14:49,599
Three possibilities

5153
04:14:49,855 --> 04:14:50,367
You walk away

5154
04:14:51,647 --> 04:14:52,927
What Alex is describing is

5155
04:14:53,183 --> 04:14:53,951
Deeply

5156
04:14:54,463 --> 04:14:54,975
Play f*****-up so

5157
04:14:55,231 --> 04:14:55,743
Situation

5158
04:14:56,767 --> 04:14:57,279
And

5159
04:14:57,535 --> 04:14:58,815
You don't have to call it bad

5160
04:14:59,839 --> 04:15:00,863
But you don't have to allow it to

5161
04:15:01,119 --> 04:15:02,655
Representatives normal heroic

5162
04:15:02,911 --> 04:15:03,423
Or

5163
04:15:07,775 --> 04:15:08,799
Yeah this is not except

5164
04:15:09,311 --> 04:15:09,823
Nope

5165
04:15:10,591 --> 04:15:12,895
Solar eclipse day are just Alex

5166
04:15:13,407 --> 04:15:13,919
Super high

5167
04:15:14,431 --> 04:15:15,199
Drunk

5168
04:15:17,247 --> 04:15:18,271
Trying to talk politics

5169
04:15:18,527 --> 04:15:19,039
It's a little bit

5170
04:15:19,551 --> 04:15:21,855
Oh no

5171
04:15:22,367 --> 04:15:23,391
And he said he wanted

5172
04:15:25,951 --> 04:15:26,463
But

5173
04:15:26,719 --> 04:15:27,231
He also want

5174
04:15:31,327 --> 04:15:31,839
There's 100

5175
04:15:32,095 --> 04:15:33,119
Thousand people watching

5176
04:15:34,655 --> 04:15:35,679
Weis

5177
04:15:35,935 --> 04:15:37,215
And he wants to keep it going

5178
04:15:37,471 --> 04:15:38,239
Which is why

5179
04:15:38,495 --> 04:15:40,799
We've gotten to the point we've gotten too already right

5180
04:15:41,055 --> 04:15:45,151
But these next

5181
04:15:45,663 --> 04:15:47,711
After the headliner goes up the hose

5182
04:15:48,735 --> 04:15:51,551
Tries to do another 10.

5183
04:15:51,807 --> 04:15:52,319
That was

5184
04:15:52,575 --> 04:15:53,343
That's not

5185
04:15:53,599 --> 04:15:54,111
No

5186
04:15:54,623 --> 04:15:56,671
No

5187
04:15:56,927 --> 04:15:58,719
Alex is holding

5188
04:16:00,255 --> 04:16:00,767
Very polite

5189
04:16:02,303 --> 04:16:04,351
Almost to their detriment

5190
04:16:08,191 --> 04:16:08,703
Looking

5191
04:16:09,215 --> 04:16:10,751
I know that Joe could have done better

5192
04:16:11,519 --> 04:16:13,567
And actually I'll get to that

5193
04:16:15,871 --> 04:16:17,407
But before we get to

5194
04:16:17,663 --> 04:16:18,431
That Alex

5195
04:16:18,687 --> 04:16:19,455
F****** dumb

5196
04:16:19,711 --> 04:16:20,223
Things

5197
04:16:20,479 --> 04:16:20,991
About politic

5198
04:16:21,759 --> 04:16:22,783
Or at least his political

5199
04:16:23,807 --> 04:16:24,831
The first one is about the LG

5200
04:16:25,855 --> 04:16:26,623
Trans people in

5201
04:16:27,135 --> 04:16:27,903
All right he shouldn't be

5202
04:16:28,671 --> 04:16:30,207
I know and this position

5203
04:16:31,487 --> 04:16:32,255
Disgusting

5204
04:16:32,767 --> 04:16:34,047
And probably one of the worst thing

5205
04:16:34,559 --> 04:16:35,071
You could have

5206
04:16:35,327 --> 04:16:36,863
Other than ounces

5207
04:16:37,375 --> 04:16:38,143
That is all trans

5208
04:16:38,399 --> 04:16:38,911
People are pedophile

5209
04:16:39,423 --> 04:16:39,935
Which

5210
04:16:40,959 --> 04:16:41,727
That's the worst

5211
04:16:42,751 --> 04:16:43,263
This

5212
04:16:45,823 --> 04:16:46,335
But where

5213
04:16:46,591 --> 04:16:47,103
On the way

5214
04:16:47,359 --> 04:16:48,383
Westside this is

5215
04:16:56,319 --> 04:17:00,671
The Japanese

5216
04:17:03,999 --> 04:17:06,303
Taxpayers will pay for it

5217
04:17:06,559 --> 04:17:08,607
You sit there and do it

5218
04:17:09,119 --> 04:17:09,887
So there's two problems

5219
04:17:10,143 --> 04:17:11,935
Who's that one is that he just too

5220
04:17:12,191 --> 04:17:12,703
These teams

5221
04:17:12,959 --> 04:17:15,263
I'm sure they're more that I want to highlight

5222
04:17:15,775 --> 04:17:16,799
What is the east

5223
04:17:17,055 --> 04:17:18,847
I think the trans women or the only

5224
04:17:19,103 --> 04:17:19,615
People who exist

5225
04:17:20,127 --> 04:17:21,919
Because he only talks about these issues in

5226
04:17:22,175 --> 04:17:23,455
In terms of I chopped dick off

5227
04:17:23,711 --> 04:17:27,295
Yeah because that's the only way.

5228
04:17:27,551 --> 04:17:33,695
Yeah you know like cuz I understand

5229
04:17:34,463 --> 04:17:34,975
That's f*****

5230
04:17:35,231 --> 04:17:39,071
That is that is exclusionary and it erasing the entire

5231
04:17:39,583 --> 04:17:40,351
Men

5232
04:17:40,607 --> 04:17:41,375
Or people

5233
04:17:42,399 --> 04:17:44,191
Oliver the gender Spectrum

5234
04:17:44,447 --> 04:17:45,727
Exactly what he believed

5235
04:17:45,983 --> 04:17:47,007
Is what's being talked about

5236
04:17:47,775 --> 04:17:48,287
Second

5237
04:17:49,567 --> 04:17:50,335
Very repulsive

5238
04:17:50,847 --> 04:17:51,871
The idea that

5239
04:17:53,151 --> 04:17:53,919
Trans people

5240
04:17:54,431 --> 04:17:55,711
Need to get surgery in order to

5241
04:17:55,967 --> 04:17:56,479
Prove it

5242
04:17:56,991 --> 04:17:58,783
That they believe what you know like

5243
04:17:59,039 --> 04:17:59,551
Whatever

5244
04:18:00,063 --> 04:18:02,623
Hey if you don't get surgery you don't mean it

5245
04:18:03,135 --> 04:18:04,159
Like that kind of thing is it

5246
04:18:04,415 --> 04:18:05,183
Exactly what Alex

5247
04:18:05,439 --> 04:18:05,951
Is

5248
04:18:06,207 --> 04:18:06,719
Describing

5249
04:18:06,975 --> 04:18:07,999
Is position

5250
04:18:08,767 --> 04:18:10,559
If you're not willing to chop your dick off then

5251
04:18:10,815 --> 04:18:11,327
You don't me

5252
04:18:12,095 --> 04:18:13,375
And I don't

5253
04:18:14,143 --> 04:18:14,911
I'm very sorry

5254
04:18:16,703 --> 04:18:17,727
Of people setting

5255
04:18:18,495 --> 04:18:19,263
Whatever say

5256
04:18:21,567 --> 04:18:22,335
Of of

5257
04:18:22,847 --> 04:18:23,615
Proving you're right

5258
04:18:25,663 --> 04:18:26,175
You

5259
04:18:26,687 --> 04:18:27,455
You are there

5260
04:18:28,223 --> 04:18:29,503
Great I'm libertarian

5261
04:18:29,759 --> 04:18:30,271
Auto Care

5262
04:18:30,527 --> 04:18:31,039
I'm not judge

5263
04:18:31,807 --> 04:18:32,831
At the same time

5264
04:18:33,087 --> 04:18:34,111
Autocorrect

5265
04:18:34,367 --> 04:18:35,391
Oh you couldn't

5266
04:18:35,647 --> 04:18:41,791
You got no

5267
04:18:45,375 --> 04:18:49,471
Then you're already wrong

5268
04:18:49,727 --> 04:18:51,007
Including the second clause

5269
04:18:51,263 --> 04:18:52,543
Which is you need to

5270
04:18:52,799 --> 04:18:54,847
You get surgery for me to validate your

5271
04:18:55,103 --> 04:18:55,615
Identity

5272
04:18:55,871 --> 04:18:56,639
It's f****** awful

5273
04:19:00,735 --> 04:19:01,503
I'm a libertarian

5274
04:19:02,015 --> 04:19:03,295
Don't think I'm a pressing

5275
04:19:04,063 --> 04:19:04,831
And then say

5276
04:19:05,087 --> 04:19:07,647
The only way I will acknowledge you is if you

5277
04:19:07,903 --> 04:19:08,415
You do what I

5278
04:19:08,671 --> 04:19:10,463
What is my bench press

5279
04:19:10,719 --> 04:19:12,255
It is like I believe the Japanese model

5280
04:19:13,791 --> 04:19:14,303
Muse model

5281
04:19:17,631 --> 04:19:19,167
Who is

5282
04:19:23,519 --> 04:19:24,031
Sure

5283
04:19:24,543 --> 04:19:26,591
Cuz I don't care I don't like

5284
04:19:30,943 --> 04:19:31,711
I'm a libertarian

5285
04:19:31,967 --> 04:19:32,479
I believe

5286
04:19:37,087 --> 04:19:37,855
So cool

5287
04:19:38,111 --> 04:19:40,415
Your bigotry cure bigotry

5288
04:19:40,671 --> 04:19:44,767
Trying through an Express I'm not a big

5289
04:19:45,023 --> 04:19:50,655
I don't care you're smarter than everybody

5290
04:19:50,911 --> 04:19:52,191
Yeah Q

5291
04:19:55,519 --> 04:19:56,287
It would

5292
04:19:56,543 --> 04:19:57,311
Prefer

5293
04:19:57,823 --> 04:19:59,103
I would genuinely

5294
04:19:59,359 --> 04:19:59,871
Prefer it if

5295
04:20:00,127 --> 04:20:00,895
If you just said

5296
04:20:01,663 --> 04:20:04,479
Trans people are gross there when I don't

5297
04:20:04,991 --> 04:20:10,623
They're weird I'm threatened by them because I love masculine or whatever

5298
04:20:12,159 --> 04:20:13,951
Voluntarily relinquishing

5299
04:20:14,463 --> 04:20:15,999
Masculinity as if that's even

5300
04:20:16,255 --> 04:20:16,767
F****** thing

5301
04:20:17,023 --> 04:20:21,119
My worldview is dependent on this

5302
04:20:21,375 --> 04:20:22,655
Buy a system

5303
04:20:22,911 --> 04:20:24,191
This bifurcated system

5304
04:20:24,447 --> 04:20:28,031
And there's a Power Balance that is intrinsically within it

5305
04:20:29,823 --> 04:20:31,359
It anything that's

5306
04:20:32,639 --> 04:20:35,199
You're ruining it for me

5307
04:20:36,479 --> 04:20:38,015
And it's the only way my brain works

5308
04:20:38,271 --> 04:20:38,783
And I

5309
04:20:39,551 --> 04:20:45,695
Some men are actually identified as well

5310
04:20:45,951 --> 04:20:52,095
Women in surgery in order to identify as women

5311
04:20:52,351 --> 04:20:55,167
Totally valid thing and it's something that everybody should respect

5312
04:20:55,423 --> 04:20:58,239
Didn't care about that muddies the goddamn water

5313
04:20:58,751 --> 04:20:59,775
Hoodoo

5314
04:21:01,311 --> 04:21:02,079
F*** you

5315
04:21:02,335 --> 04:21:03,103
If you because of

5316
04:21:03,615 --> 04:21:04,383
Just said it was gross

5317
04:21:05,919 --> 04:21:07,455
Then we can have a conversation

5318
04:21:07,711 --> 04:21:11,807
But if you hide behind it is though

5319
04:21:13,087 --> 04:21:15,391
He is the reason that he jumps from A to B to C.

5320
04:21:15,903 --> 04:21:17,439
Yeah

5321
04:21:17,695 --> 04:21:21,279
Yeah

5322
04:21:21,535 --> 04:21:22,047
It's the same story

5323
04:21:22,815 --> 04:21:23,327
Do you have to

5324
04:21:24,351 --> 04:21:24,863
You have to just

5325
04:21:26,911 --> 04:21:27,679
Make an audit

5326
04:21:28,959 --> 04:21:29,471
In order for you

5327
04:21:30,239 --> 04:21:32,799
The red flag

5328
04:21:33,823 --> 04:21:34,847
Around

5329
04:21:36,127 --> 04:21:37,407
I did so sick of it

5330
04:21:37,663 --> 04:21:40,735
He were to just come out and say what do you mean

5331
04:21:40,991 --> 04:21:41,503
You're saying

5332
04:21:41,759 --> 04:21:42,271
Which is the

5333
04:21:42,527 --> 04:21:44,319
I think this is gross

5334
04:21:44,575 --> 04:21:47,647
It threatens my worldview I'm scared of this

5335
04:21:48,159 --> 04:21:49,439
I don't know what to do with it

5336
04:21:50,975 --> 04:21:51,487
Then you could

5337
04:21:51,999 --> 04:21:56,863
Coolest talk

5338
04:21:58,911 --> 04:21:59,935
He's the Matador who hasn't

5339
04:22:00,191 --> 04:22:01,727
Trained or what

5340
04:22:01,983 --> 04:22:02,751
He's a Sitting Duck

5341
04:22:03,263 --> 04:22:04,031
He knows that that

5342
04:22:04,543 --> 04:22:05,055
Is bad

5343
04:22:06,591 --> 04:22:07,359
Use the red key

5344
04:22:08,383 --> 04:22:09,407
Right ever whatever

5345
04:22:09,663 --> 04:22:10,431
Dumb narrative

5346
04:22:10,687 --> 04:22:15,039
It's the thing that all of these people do when they're talking about

5347
04:22:15,295 --> 04:22:15,807
The lgbtq

5348
04:22:16,319 --> 04:22:16,831
Cute

5349
04:22:17,855 --> 04:22:19,391
It is always this

5350
04:22:19,647 --> 04:22:20,159
Idea of

5351
04:22:20,927 --> 04:22:22,719
If I were to say my real is

5352
04:22:23,231 --> 04:22:23,999
Which is bad

5353
04:22:24,511 --> 04:22:25,023
I'm grossed out

5354
04:22:25,279 --> 04:22:25,791
Not understand

5355
04:22:26,815 --> 04:22:28,095
Then the conversation because

5356
04:22:29,375 --> 04:22:29,887
Why

5357
04:22:30,143 --> 04:22:31,679
Why do you feel that

5358
04:22:32,191 --> 04:22:35,775
That's a no because then they have to wrestle with

5359
04:22:37,311 --> 04:22:39,103
It's not that they're having a problem

5360
04:22:39,359 --> 04:22:40,383
They're not having a

5361
04:22:41,151 --> 04:22:41,663
I am

5362
04:22:42,943 --> 04:22:43,967
Because of my problem

5363
04:22:44,223 --> 04:22:45,247
And making their lives

5364
04:22:45,503 --> 04:22:48,319
Deal with the

5365
04:22:48,575 --> 04:22:49,087
Feel this way

5366
04:22:50,111 --> 04:22:52,159
It all falls apart

5367
04:22:53,183 --> 04:22:55,487
Because I think on a on some emotional level

5368
04:22:56,255 --> 04:22:57,791
They recognized

5369
04:22:58,047 --> 04:22:58,559
That what they would have

5370
04:22:59,327 --> 04:23:00,095
Dilworth

5371
04:23:00,351 --> 04:23:00,863
With that wife

5372
04:23:02,143 --> 04:23:03,935
Entrenched power

5373
04:23:04,703 --> 04:23:07,263
Those are unwilling to unpack

5374
04:23:07,519 --> 04:23:11,359
Right because I have a privilege that is

5375
04:23:13,663 --> 04:23:15,967
Unpacking that suitcase or whatever is

5376
04:23:16,223 --> 04:23:18,015
Unwilling or unable

5377
04:23:18,271 --> 04:23:18,783
Able to do

5378
04:23:19,807 --> 04:23:20,575
It does

5379
04:23:20,831 --> 04:23:21,855
Make good sense

5380
04:23:22,367 --> 04:23:23,391
Syndaver open

5381
04:23:24,671 --> 04:23:25,951
If you can find some store

5382
04:23:26,207 --> 04:23:26,975
The way to

5383
04:23:28,255 --> 04:23:29,023
That is never the cobra

5384
04:23:29,535 --> 04:23:30,559
Yas track from

5385
04:23:31,071 --> 04:23:32,095
Yeah

5386
04:23:32,351 --> 04:23:33,119
The Y

5387
04:23:33,375 --> 04:23:34,399
Find out why

5388
04:23:35,679 --> 04:23:36,447
They're distracting

5389
04:23:36,703 --> 04:23:37,471
I'm having to talk about

5390
04:23:37,983 --> 04:23:38,495
With other thing

5391
04:23:39,519 --> 04:23:41,823
External because if they admit the Y

5392
04:23:42,079 --> 04:23:42,591
They would have to

5393
04:23:42,847 --> 04:23:43,359
Too bad

5394
04:23:43,871 --> 04:23:44,895
Fronts the reality

5395
04:23:45,407 --> 04:23:45,919
Or that have to

5396
04:23:46,175 --> 04:23:49,503
Given that they have to accept that it's actually their problem

5397
04:23:51,807 --> 04:23:52,319
F****** tied.

5398
04:23:52,575 --> 04:23:53,087
Does alien ship

5399
04:23:53,599 --> 04:23:55,135
He's talking about and then finally

5400
04:23:55,391 --> 04:23:55,903
Presstube

5401
04:23:56,671 --> 04:23:57,439
Stubblebine

5402
04:23:57,951 --> 04:23:59,231
The unpacking of the

5403
04:23:59,743 --> 04:24:00,255
Yeah

5404
04:24:00,511 --> 04:24:03,327
Don't want to

5405
04:24:03,839 --> 04:24:05,887
Because now you lay your cards on the table

5406
04:24:06,143 --> 04:24:06,911
That's why

5407
04:24:08,703 --> 04:24:10,239
Yeah

5408
04:24:11,519 --> 04:24:12,031
Talk.

5409
04:24:12,799 --> 04:24:13,311
Do it come on

5410
04:24:13,823 --> 04:24:19,967
Come on guy I know I know

5411
04:24:20,223 --> 04:24:21,503
In high school

5412
04:24:22,271 --> 04:24:23,551
There was a kid who

5413
04:24:25,343 --> 04:24:25,855
Was

5414
04:24:26,111 --> 04:24:27,903
Just very gradually all he did

5415
04:24:28,415 --> 04:24:28,927
He started

5416
04:24:29,183 --> 04:24:29,695
Signing his

5417
04:24:29,951 --> 04:24:30,463
Name on paper

5418
04:24:31,231 --> 04:24:32,511
As

5419
04:24:32,767 --> 04:24:33,279
And

5420
04:24:33,535 --> 04:24:34,815
That was the way she

5421
04:24:35,327 --> 04:24:36,095
Came out

5422
04:24:36,351 --> 04:24:38,143
And most people didn't even notice it

5423
04:24:38,911 --> 04:24:39,935
Most teachers didn't even

5424
04:24:40,447 --> 04:24:41,727
But it was such

5425
04:24:42,495 --> 04:24:43,775
Such a powerful thing

5426
04:24:44,031 --> 04:24:45,567
For her to have just

5427
04:24:45,823 --> 04:24:46,335
Done that

5428
04:24:46,591 --> 04:24:47,871
In a way that is

5429
04:24:49,151 --> 04:24:49,663
Not

5430
04:24:50,687 --> 04:24:51,455
Just amazing

5431
04:24:51,711 --> 04:24:53,503
I would never if if

5432
04:24:53,759 --> 04:24:54,527
I would never have had

5433
04:24:55,807 --> 04:24:59,391
That's incredible welcome so much horrible things

5434
04:25:00,671 --> 04:25:02,207
The possibilities of the bullying

5435
04:25:02,463 --> 04:25:02,975
And whatever people

5436
04:25:03,487 --> 04:25:06,815
Control of her identity in a way that is

5437
04:25:07,071 --> 04:25:08,095
Is more powerful than

5438
04:25:08,863 --> 04:25:09,375
I could hope

5439
04:25:09,887 --> 04:25:10,399
To do

5440
04:25:10,655 --> 04:25:11,167
I like itching

5441
04:25:11,423 --> 04:25:12,191
Incredible

5442
04:25:16,031 --> 04:25:17,055
So he can go f*** himself

5443
04:25:18,079 --> 04:25:19,103
Whatever

5444
04:25:19,615 --> 04:25:20,895
Not whatever I didn't mean that to be

5445
04:25:22,175 --> 04:25:24,735
But in this next clip Alex now brings it

5446
04:25:26,271 --> 04:25:27,039
Re-stuff

5447
04:25:27,295 --> 04:25:28,063
What you've already heard

5448
04:25:28,319 --> 04:25:29,343
He loves Korean food

5449
04:25:31,135 --> 04:25:31,647
There

5450
04:25:31,903 --> 04:25:32,671
I think is one of the

5451
04:25:32,927 --> 04:25:33,439
Practice

5452
04:25:37,279 --> 04:25:38,303
Black people

5453
04:25:38,815 --> 04:25:42,399
Cuz that was really expensive

5454
04:25:46,239 --> 04:25:49,311
Concierge

5455
04:25:50,079 --> 04:25:52,895
What the hell is one was like

5456
04:25:53,407 --> 04:25:55,967
They were like oh my God he's

5457
04:26:06,719 --> 04:26:08,255
I feel like I should give you context

5458
04:26:08,511 --> 04:26:14,655
But also allow you to live in that gross space

5459
04:26:15,423 --> 04:26:16,447
But that was brain works

5460
04:26:16,959 --> 04:26:17,471
Expressing

5461
04:26:17,983 --> 04:26:20,543
Have you started that clip by saying I don't go off of

5462
04:26:20,799 --> 04:26:21,311
Money

5463
04:26:21,567 --> 04:26:23,103
And then the end result of it is

5464
04:26:23,615 --> 04:26:24,383
Spell by-product

5465
04:26:24,639 --> 04:26:26,431
Which isn't it awesome that I show some

5466
04:26:26,943 --> 04:26:27,967
Sort of compassion

5467
04:26:28,223 --> 04:26:28,991
Towards a black

5468
04:26:29,247 --> 04:26:31,551
Then all of a sudden black people buy products from me

5469
04:26:32,063 --> 04:26:32,575
Weird

5470
04:26:33,087 --> 04:26:38,207
So what are you talkin about is that woman who drove her car into a barricade at the White House

5471
04:26:38,463 --> 04:26:39,487
And she was shot

5472
04:26:40,767 --> 04:26:41,535
Hey the f*****-up

5473
04:26:41,791 --> 04:26:42,303
Situation

5474
04:26:42,559 --> 04:26:43,327
Wouldn't have happened if

5475
04:26:43,839 --> 04:26:44,351
German car

5476
04:26:44,607 --> 04:26:45,119
Barricade

5477
04:26:45,887 --> 04:26:47,167
I don't know all the details that's

5478
04:26:47,423 --> 04:26:47,935
Situation

5479
04:26:48,447 --> 04:26:48,959
I do think it's

5480
04:26:49,983 --> 04:26:51,775
That I could bring that up as like a

5481
04:26:52,031 --> 04:26:52,543
Evidence

5482
04:26:52,799 --> 04:26:53,823
He cares about black people

5483
04:26:54,335 --> 04:26:56,639
Yeah face on all the other stuff we know about her

5484
04:26:57,407 --> 04:26:57,919
And what

5485
04:26:59,199 --> 04:27:01,247
Let's let's bring the one black woman

5486
04:27:06,367 --> 04:27:06,879
Great

5487
04:27:07,391 --> 04:27:07,903
You did it

5488
04:27:08,415 --> 04:27:09,183
You've solved

5489
04:27:11,231 --> 04:27:11,743
Racist

5490
04:27:11,999 --> 04:27:12,511
Pile of

5491
04:27:12,767 --> 04:27:13,535
F****** garbage

5492
04:27:14,303 --> 04:27:15,583
How

5493
04:27:16,095 --> 04:27:16,607
How

5494
04:27:16,863 --> 04:27:17,887
Goddamn dare you say

5495
04:27:20,703 --> 04:27:21,215
We all knew it

5496
04:27:21,471 --> 04:27:22,239
We all knew it

5497
04:27:23,775 --> 04:27:25,055
That the reason was

5498
04:27:25,311 --> 04:27:26,079
Purely

5499
04:27:26,335 --> 04:27:26,847
Money motive

5500
04:27:27,871 --> 04:27:28,383
But

5501
04:27:28,895 --> 04:27:29,663
God dammit

5502
04:27:34,015 --> 04:27:34,527
The end on this

5503
04:27:36,575 --> 04:27:37,087
So there's another good

5504
04:27:38,111 --> 04:27:38,623
Five

5505
04:27:39,903 --> 04:27:40,415
Weather just like

5506
04:27:42,719 --> 04:27:43,487
Who needs

5507
04:27:44,255 --> 04:27:45,023
Click click

5508
04:27:46,047 --> 04:27:46,815
Enjoy

5509
04:27:47,071 --> 04:27:49,119
Press stop record

5510
04:27:49,375 --> 04:27:51,423
The his five-hour episode 20 or the actual

5511
04:27:52,447 --> 04:27:52,959
Mtume

5512
04:27:53,215 --> 04:27:53,983
When Alex is saying like

5513
04:27:55,263 --> 04:27:55,775
Crazy eyes

5514
04:27:56,031 --> 04:27:56,543
I just

5515
04:27:57,823 --> 04:27:58,335
Maytag

5516
04:27:59,103 --> 04:27:59,871
Conspiracy of

5517
04:28:00,895 --> 04:28:01,407
Person who is

5518
04:28:01,663 --> 04:28:02,175
The victim to self

5519
04:28:04,223 --> 04:28:04,991
Black people

5520
04:28:05,503 --> 04:28:06,015
Bought my shoes

5521
04:28:06,783 --> 04:28:12,159
No living black person has ever experienced as much racism as

5522
04:28:12,415 --> 04:28:12,927
Is Alex is it

5523
04:28:13,183 --> 04:28:13,951
Experienced from

5524
04:28:14,719 --> 04:28:15,487
He also said that

5525
04:28:15,999 --> 04:28:17,023
Is the new Martin Luther

5526
04:28:17,535 --> 04:28:18,559
Yeah

5527
04:28:20,095 --> 04:28:20,607
So

5528
04:28:21,119 --> 04:28:23,167
We come to the end of it and like I

5529
04:28:23,935 --> 04:28:24,447
Don't

5530
04:28:24,703 --> 04:28:26,751
First of all Queer four-and-a-half hours in

5531
04:28:27,263 --> 04:28:28,287
Episode

5532
04:28:28,543 --> 04:28:30,335
Hey everyone who is

5533
04:28:30,591 --> 04:28:31,871
Complained about our short episodes

5534
04:28:32,127 --> 04:28:32,895
Go suck a lemon

5535
04:28:33,663 --> 04:28:34,175
Second

5536
04:28:34,687 --> 04:28:35,455
I didn't that was

5537
04:28:36,223 --> 04:28:36,735
It was a little

5538
04:28:36,991 --> 04:28:37,503
But I do

5539
04:28:38,527 --> 04:28:40,063
I know I know you do

5540
04:28:40,831 --> 04:28:41,599
Because I

5541
04:28:42,623 --> 04:28:43,135
Are we always go to

5542
04:28:45,439 --> 04:28:45,951
Too short

5543
04:28:46,207 --> 04:28:46,719
Anyway

5544
04:28:46,975 --> 04:28:48,767
My point is I didn't want to do

5545
04:28:49,279 --> 04:28:51,839
Episode

5546
04:28:52,095 --> 04:28:53,119
Cuz we had a lot of fun with

5547
04:28:53,375 --> 04:28:53,887
Various

5548
04:28:54,143 --> 04:28:56,191
Yeah but I do. I don't

5549
04:28:56,703 --> 04:28:57,215
This was

5550
04:28:58,239 --> 04:28:59,007
And I don't think

5551
04:28:59,263 --> 04:29:00,031
More attention should

5552
04:29:00,287 --> 04:29:01,055
To be drawn to it

5553
04:29:01,567 --> 04:29:02,591
And I do

5554
04:29:02,847 --> 04:29:03,359
Recognize the

5555
04:29:04,383 --> 04:29:04,895
Sort of

5556
04:29:06,943 --> 04:29:07,711
Hypocrisy of it

5557
04:29:07,967 --> 04:29:08,479
To a certain extent

5558
04:29:08,735 --> 04:29:10,527
We're doing an episode about it while saying

5559
04:29:11,551 --> 04:29:12,063
No one should

5560
04:29:12,319 --> 04:29:12,831
To pay attention to

5561
04:29:13,343 --> 04:29:18,463
Well I mean the very is the Hardline for us to walk the very concept of our show is

5562
04:29:19,487 --> 04:29:20,511
We cover Alex

5563
04:29:20,767 --> 04:29:21,279
Jones

5564
04:29:21,535 --> 04:29:22,047
Which

5565
04:29:22,303 --> 04:29:23,327
By necessity means

5566
04:29:23,583 --> 04:29:24,351
We have to bring it

5567
04:29:25,375 --> 04:29:25,887
Alex Jones

5568
04:29:26,143 --> 04:29:28,191
So when Alex Jones does a

5569
04:29:28,447 --> 04:29:30,239
Stunts in order to get attention

5570
04:29:31,519 --> 04:29:32,031
Weed

5571
04:29:32,543 --> 04:29:34,335
I have a certain responsibility.

5572
04:29:34,591 --> 04:29:36,383
Cover it while at the same time

5573
04:29:37,663 --> 04:29:39,199
Recognize that we are

5574
04:29:39,711 --> 04:29:41,247
In a way participating

5575
04:29:41,503 --> 04:29:42,527
Again the very thing that he

5576
04:29:42,783 --> 04:29:43,551
Desire

5577
04:29:43,807 --> 04:29:44,831
Initio of

5578
04:29:45,343 --> 04:29:46,111
You shouldn't cover it

5579
04:29:46,367 --> 04:29:46,879
.

5580
04:29:47,135 --> 04:29:48,159
Edgemoor you should cover

5581
04:29:48,415 --> 04:29:48,927
For him

5582
04:29:49,183 --> 04:29:49,951
Inappropriate

5583
04:29:51,999 --> 04:29:52,511
Is what you mean

5584
04:29:53,023 --> 04:29:53,535
As opposed to

5585
04:29:53,791 --> 04:29:54,303
Do what he wants

5586
04:29:54,815 --> 04:29:55,327
Do I

5587
04:29:55,839 --> 04:29:59,167
Cover

5588
04:30:00,447 --> 04:30:01,215
Cinebowl

5589
04:30:03,007 --> 04:30:03,519
Questions about this

5590
04:30:03,775 --> 04:30:06,079
Episode is only because of that pro wrestling

5591
04:30:06,335 --> 04:30:07,103
Vagueness of like

5592
04:30:07,615 --> 04:30:09,151
I don't f****** know what he's lying

5593
04:30:09,407 --> 04:30:09,919
Hang about here

5594
04:30:10,175 --> 04:30:11,199
Yeah you know how much of this

5595
04:30:11,455 --> 04:30:12,479
Is blustery bulshit

5596
04:30:12,991 --> 04:30:15,551
So there is there is a part where we're taking

5597
04:30:16,063 --> 04:30:17,087
There's a little bit of faith

5598
04:30:17,599 --> 04:30:19,135
On our end

5599
04:30:21,183 --> 04:30:23,231
Should we care that he's talking about

5600
04:30:23,487 --> 04:30:24,511
Basically being statue

5601
04:30:25,279 --> 04:30:26,047
Raped by a bee

5602
04:30:26,303 --> 04:30:26,815
Abusive women

5603
04:30:27,071 --> 04:30:27,839
Repeatedly

5604
04:30:28,095 --> 04:30:29,887
Should we care about that I mean

5605
04:30:32,703 --> 04:30:33,215
But

5606
04:30:33,471 --> 04:30:34,239
Is it a lie

5607
04:30:35,263 --> 04:30:37,311
Is it a machismo

5608
04:30:37,823 --> 04:30:38,591
Right

5609
04:30:40,383 --> 04:30:41,919
We deal with him by whatever

5610
04:30:43,711 --> 04:30:44,223
You do the best you can

5611
04:30:45,503 --> 04:30:48,575
I like Alex with Steve pieczenik we do not trust

5612
04:30:48,831 --> 04:30:50,111
Blindly

5613
04:30:50,367 --> 04:30:51,135
Our source

5614
04:30:52,927 --> 04:30:53,439
True

5615
04:30:53,695 --> 04:30:54,207
Amen

5616
04:30:54,463 --> 04:30:55,487
The bigger issue is

5617
04:30:57,279 --> 04:30:58,559
The conversation about Alex

5618
04:30:58,815 --> 04:30:59,583
This is kind of moot

5619
04:30:59,839 --> 04:31:00,351
To some extent

5620
04:31:00,607 --> 04:31:01,375
Because we know him

5621
04:31:01,631 --> 04:31:02,143
From his

5622
04:31:02,655 --> 04:31:03,679
His Works Ferg

5623
04:31:04,191 --> 04:31:05,983
This is just Alex

5624
04:31:06,239 --> 04:31:08,031
Really f***** up on a show that

5625
04:31:08,287 --> 04:31:08,799
Uno's

5626
04:31:09,055 --> 04:31:10,591
It's way more traction than

5627
04:31:11,871 --> 04:31:12,895
And he's trying to

5628
04:31:13,151 --> 04:31:14,175
To appeal to Joe's audio

5629
04:31:15,711 --> 04:31:18,527
All these alien Dumbo

5630
04:31:18,783 --> 04:31:20,831
Did aliens and meeting

5631
04:31:21,087 --> 04:31:21,855
My dad

5632
04:31:22,111 --> 04:31:22,623
Did

5633
04:31:22,879 --> 04:31:25,695
Cyborgs and all that s***

5634
04:31:25,951 --> 04:31:26,719
All that stuff

5635
04:31:27,487 --> 04:31:28,511
You get

5636
04:31:30,303 --> 04:31:31,071
I'm

5637
04:31:31,327 --> 04:31:32,095
Pointed in Rogan

5638
04:31:32,607 --> 04:31:33,631
To a very soon

5639
04:31:33,887 --> 04:31:34,399
Serious degree

5640
04:31:35,167 --> 04:31:36,191
I understand why

5641
04:31:36,447 --> 04:31:36,959
He did what he did

5642
04:31:38,239 --> 04:31:38,751
Be present

5643
04:31:39,007 --> 04:31:39,519
It is coming

5644
04:31:39,775 --> 04:31:40,287
From like a human

5645
04:31:41,311 --> 04:31:43,103
I love you you're my friend

5646
04:31:43,359 --> 04:31:44,639
Yeah I want to

5647
04:31:44,895 --> 04:31:45,919
Give you a fair reading

5648
04:31:46,431 --> 04:31:47,711
And I recognize that

5649
04:31:48,479 --> 04:31:49,759
You only lashed out at maybe

5650
04:31:50,015 --> 04:31:50,783
Because we weren't in

5651
04:31:51,039 --> 04:31:51,807
Communication

5652
04:31:52,063 --> 04:31:53,087
If you felt like you were on

5653
04:31:53,599 --> 04:31:54,111
Outside

5654
04:31:54,367 --> 04:31:55,391
And I was

5655
04:31:56,927 --> 04:31:57,439
Rejecting you

5656
04:31:59,743 --> 04:32:01,023
I think that's a dishonest

5657
04:32:01,791 --> 04:32:02,559
Of what Alice

5658
04:32:04,095 --> 04:32:04,863
I think that

5659
04:32:06,143 --> 04:32:06,655
I think

5660
04:32:06,911 --> 04:32:07,679
On one level

5661
04:32:08,959 --> 04:32:09,727
Way to accept

5662
04:32:11,775 --> 04:32:12,287
Embracing

5663
04:32:12,543 --> 04:32:13,311
King of Alex's

5664
04:32:14,591 --> 04:32:16,639
Wichita Falls under that heading of

5665
04:32:16,895 --> 04:32:17,663
Enable

5666
04:32:17,919 --> 04:32:19,199
Like Alex lashed out

5667
04:32:19,967 --> 04:32:20,479
In a wave

5668
04:32:21,759 --> 04:32:22,783
If not playing

5669
04:32:23,807 --> 04:32:24,319
Like I don't think

5670
04:32:25,599 --> 04:32:27,903
Planet together

5671
04:32:28,415 --> 04:32:29,439
Alex plan.

5672
04:32:30,207 --> 04:32:31,231
It was art

5673
04:32:31,487 --> 04:32:32,255
Official

5674
04:32:33,535 --> 04:32:35,327
Sure but did Jose response to

5675
04:32:35,583 --> 04:32:36,607
If not playing

5676
04:32:36,863 --> 04:32:37,887
Is the worst

5677
04:32:38,655 --> 04:32:39,167
You could do

5678
04:32:39,423 --> 04:32:39,935
In these circumstances

5679
04:32:41,215 --> 04:32:41,983
It is allowing a

5680
04:32:42,751 --> 04:32:43,263
Behave the way he

5681
04:32:44,287 --> 04:32:44,799
Lead up to this

5682
04:32:45,311 --> 04:32:46,591
With the stunt aspect

5683
04:32:47,871 --> 04:32:48,895
Bummer to hang you up like a

5684
04:32:49,151 --> 04:32:49,663
Stuck pigs

5685
04:32:49,919 --> 04:32:52,735
Throat politically all this s*** yeah like all that nonsense

5686
04:32:53,247 --> 04:32:54,783
He allows him to behave that way

5687
04:32:55,295 --> 04:32:55,807
No

5688
04:32:57,599 --> 04:32:58,111
Alex

5689
04:32:58,623 --> 04:32:59,135
Exactly

5690
04:33:00,159 --> 04:33:00,671
Which is

5691
04:33:01,183 --> 04:33:02,207
Yeasty rolls

5692
04:33:02,463 --> 04:33:03,231
5 hours

5693
04:33:03,743 --> 04:33:04,767
With Jose audio

5694
04:33:05,791 --> 04:33:06,303
And Joe's Auto

5695
04:33:06,559 --> 04:33:07,071
Will think

5696
04:33:07,327 --> 04:33:08,607
This is one of the most a

5697
04:33:09,119 --> 04:33:09,887
Episodes ever

5698
04:33:11,935 --> 04:33:12,959
Cease having access to

5699
04:33:13,215 --> 04:33:16,799
Space aliens

5700
04:33:17,055 --> 04:33:19,871
Alex get back any of their father is a

5701
04:33:20,127 --> 04:33:21,919
Used in with Wernher von Braun

5702
04:33:22,431 --> 04:33:26,015
You get back any of this stuff up it's not talks about normally

5703
04:33:26,783 --> 04:33:27,807
At least not anymore

5704
04:33:28,063 --> 04:33:28,575
More vague

5705
04:33:28,831 --> 04:33:29,855
Vague language Papa

5706
04:33:30,367 --> 04:33:30,879
With the

5707
04:33:31,135 --> 04:33:31,903
This is him

5708
04:33:32,415 --> 04:33:32,927
Posturing

5709
04:33:33,439 --> 04:33:34,463
Joe is allowed him

5710
04:33:34,719 --> 04:33:35,231
Essentially

5711
04:33:35,743 --> 04:33:36,255
To come in

5712
04:33:36,767 --> 04:33:37,279
In Rec shop

5713
04:33:38,047 --> 04:33:38,815
He is just allowed

5714
04:33:40,095 --> 04:33:40,607
Maybe like

5715
04:33:43,935 --> 04:33:48,287
Aren't you interested

5716
04:33:48,799 --> 04:33:50,335
Not all of them like B

5717
04:33:51,359 --> 04:33:52,127
Enough of them

5718
04:33:52,383 --> 04:33:53,407
It'll probably give

5719
04:33:53,919 --> 04:33:55,199
The blood infusion that he needs

5720
04:33:55,711 --> 04:33:56,735
With the

5721
04:33:56,991 --> 04:33:57,759
Is inability

5722
04:33:58,271 --> 04:33:58,783
Get new people

5723
04:33:59,039 --> 04:33:59,551
Call Ann

5724
04:33:59,807 --> 04:34:00,319
He's taken

5725
04:34:00,831 --> 04:34:01,343
Dumb people

5726
04:34:01,599 --> 04:34:02,623
Listen to Rogan

5727
04:34:03,135 --> 04:34:03,647
Know about alley

5728
04:34:04,159 --> 04:34:05,183
And fed them

5729
04:34:05,695 --> 04:34:06,207
Is marketing

5730
04:34:06,975 --> 04:34:07,487
He's giving them

5731
04:34:08,255 --> 04:34:09,023
Fusion that he needs

5732
04:34:10,047 --> 04:34:10,559
Things going

5733
04:34:10,815 --> 04:34:11,327
For a little bit

5734
04:34:12,351 --> 04:34:13,119
And that I think is it

5735
04:34:14,143 --> 04:34:14,655
Pathetic Act

5736
04:34:15,167 --> 04:34:16,447
Grogan weather is intense

5737
04:34:16,959 --> 04:34:17,471
Pure or not

5738
04:34:18,751 --> 04:34:20,031
You got played he got played

5739
04:34:20,287 --> 04:34:25,663
Firepro exactly this is boiling down to to reality

5740
04:34:26,431 --> 04:34:26,943
1

5741
04:34:28,991 --> 04:34:29,759
Rogan

5742
04:34:30,015 --> 04:34:30,527
Nose

5743
04:34:31,295 --> 04:34:31,807
That

5744
04:34:32,319 --> 04:34:34,111
Alex was playing him

5745
04:34:34,879 --> 04:34:37,183
Rogan

5746
04:34:37,439 --> 04:34:38,463
To accept it but yet

5747
04:34:38,719 --> 04:34:39,231
You probably knew

5748
04:34:39,487 --> 04:34:41,023
Either he knows

5749
04:34:42,303 --> 04:34:44,095
Allowed it because he

5750
04:34:44,351 --> 04:34:44,863
Also

5751
04:34:45,375 --> 04:34:46,911
That it was a thing

5752
04:34:47,423 --> 04:34:48,959
That people would come to his show

5753
04:34:49,471 --> 04:34:51,775
So either with cross on his part as well

5754
04:34:52,799 --> 04:34:53,311
Or

5755
04:34:53,823 --> 04:34:54,591
Rogan

5756
04:34:54,847 --> 04:34:55,615
F****** place

5757
04:34:56,383 --> 04:34:57,919
Like there's no other option

5758
04:34:58,175 --> 04:34:58,687
To look at this

5759
04:34:59,199 --> 04:35:00,735
Either

5760
04:35:00,991 --> 04:35:01,759
I steer towards

5761
04:35:02,015 --> 04:35:08,159
The ladder operate

5762
04:35:08,415 --> 04:35:11,487
JoJo behaved on the

5763
04:35:11,743 --> 04:35:13,791
Like I said

5764
04:35:14,047 --> 04:35:15,327
Play where you talkin about how like

5765
04:35:15,583 --> 04:35:17,375
This is the Alex I know in love

5766
04:35:17,631 --> 04:35:19,167
Right I want

5767
04:35:19,423 --> 04:35:20,959
Able to see this version of Alex

5768
04:35:21,471 --> 04:35:23,519
It's fun we're laughing we're having right time

5769
04:35:23,775 --> 04:35:24,543
That sort of thing

5770
04:35:24,799 --> 04:35:28,895
There is dispersion you're describing is a manipulative piece of s***

5771
04:35:29,663 --> 04:35:31,199
I think that he doesn't recognize

5772
04:35:31,711 --> 04:35:32,223
So many

5773
04:35:32,479 --> 04:35:32,991
Give the things that he

5774
04:35:33,759 --> 04:35:34,527
Funny about Alex

5775
04:35:35,039 --> 04:35:35,551
Are the

5776
04:35:35,807 --> 04:35:36,319
Tools that Alex

5777
04:35:36,831 --> 04:35:38,879
I wish you realize

5778
04:35:40,671 --> 04:35:41,183
I'm doing like

5779
04:35:43,487 --> 04:35:44,511
Yes all that stuff

5780
04:35:44,767 --> 04:35:45,791
Is a tool that

5781
04:35:46,559 --> 04:35:47,327
To manipulate

5782
04:35:48,863 --> 04:35:49,375
You talkin about

5783
04:35:49,631 --> 04:35:50,399
At the same time

5784
04:35:50,655 --> 04:35:51,167
Rogan

5785
04:35:51,423 --> 04:35:51,935
Years that is

5786
04:35:52,447 --> 04:35:52,959
Disc

5787
04:35:56,031 --> 04:35:57,055
That's it that's funny

5788
04:35:58,079 --> 04:35:58,591
I don't I

5789
04:36:05,247 --> 04:36:08,319
Is that track with all people Gaston dad

5790
04:36:08,575 --> 04:36:09,599
I know

5791
04:36:11,903 --> 04:36:13,951
The letter as well

5792
04:36:14,719 --> 04:36:17,535
And it does seem like Joe is coming from a good place

5793
04:36:17,791 --> 04:36:18,303
Position

5794
04:36:18,559 --> 04:36:20,607
And he doesn't realize that Alex

5795
04:36:20,863 --> 04:36:21,631
Is not actually a spy

5796
04:36:22,399 --> 04:36:24,703
And he should have listened to me when I was Joe's dad

5797
04:36:25,215 --> 04:36:27,775
And told him that people who lie to him to his face

5798
04:36:28,287 --> 04:36:28,799
Hernandez friend

5799
04:36:29,567 --> 04:36:30,079
If only

5800
04:36:30,335 --> 04:36:32,127
And also Eddie Bravo

5801
04:36:32,383 --> 04:36:33,407
Is dumbest yet

5802
04:36:33,663 --> 04:36:39,807
Still probably 60 I agree 100%

5803
04:36:40,063 --> 04:36:41,599
Longer with just Jo and Alex

5804
04:36:41,855 --> 04:36:42,879
He probably looks better

5805
04:36:43,391 --> 04:36:43,903
Oh yeah

5806
04:36:44,415 --> 04:36:46,207
Getting him in there is a rogue variable

5807
04:36:46,719 --> 04:36:47,231
Really

5808
04:36:47,743 --> 04:36:48,255
Exist

5809
04:36:48,767 --> 04:36:50,047
Close to listenable

5810
04:36:51,071 --> 04:36:51,583
Anyway

5811
04:36:52,095 --> 04:36:52,607
I hate this

5812
04:36:55,423 --> 04:36:56,191
But I hate I hate

5813
04:36:56,447 --> 04:36:57,215
This

5814
04:37:00,287 --> 04:37:00,799
Think Joe

5815
04:37:01,567 --> 04:37:02,079
Wrong

5816
04:37:02,847 --> 04:37:04,127
Regardless of his intentions

5817
04:37:05,151 --> 04:37:05,919
Could be great

5818
04:37:06,687 --> 04:37:07,199
Could be coming

5819
04:37:07,455 --> 04:37:07,967
Play Swan

5820
04:37:09,247 --> 04:37:09,759
Whatever

5821
04:37:10,015 --> 04:37:10,527
I don't care

5822
04:37:11,295 --> 04:37:11,807
This is garbage

5823
04:37:13,343 --> 04:37:13,855
Amateurish

5824
04:37:14,879 --> 04:37:15,391
He's allowed

5825
04:37:17,183 --> 04:37:18,463
Just say all sorts of things

5826
04:37:18,719 --> 04:37:19,231
Indifferent

5827
04:37:19,487 --> 04:37:19,999
Ansible on his show

5828
04:37:20,767 --> 04:37:22,303
And he has no idea why there

5829
04:37:23,583 --> 04:37:24,095
And that's the

5830
04:37:24,351 --> 04:37:25,887
The problem that's the problem

5831
04:37:29,215 --> 04:37:31,263
Sick people we have this fun time having these conversations

5832
04:37:32,031 --> 04:37:32,543
That's cool

5833
04:37:34,335 --> 04:37:35,359
Your infested with

5834
04:37:35,615 --> 04:37:36,127
Manipulator

5835
04:37:37,407 --> 04:37:37,919
You have

5836
04:37:38,175 --> 04:37:38,687
People within the

5837
04:37:38,943 --> 04:37:39,455
Agenda

5838
04:37:39,711 --> 04:37:41,247
You aren't having a conversation

5839
04:37:42,527 --> 04:37:43,295
That's the problem

5840
04:37:43,551 --> 04:37:44,575
They're having a conversation

5841
04:37:44,831 --> 04:37:45,599
With your listeners

5842
04:37:45,855 --> 04:37:46,367
And your watch

5843
04:37:46,879 --> 04:37:47,391
Exactly

5844
04:37:47,647 --> 04:37:48,927
You haven't conversation with Duncan

5845
04:37:49,183 --> 04:37:50,719
Trussell Ari shaffir

5846
04:37:51,231 --> 04:37:51,999
Joey Diaz

5847
04:37:52,511 --> 04:37:54,047
Tom Segura

5848
04:37:54,303 --> 04:37:54,815
These people

5849
04:37:55,839 --> 04:37:56,351
You guys just

5850
04:37:56,607 --> 04:37:58,399
Spitballing ideas

5851
04:37:58,655 --> 04:37:59,679
Maybe you guys say some stuff

5852
04:37:59,935 --> 04:38:00,703
Pretty f*****-up

5853
04:38:01,727 --> 04:38:04,287
You're that is what you want the show to

5854
04:38:06,335 --> 04:38:06,847
Reduce it to be

5855
04:38:07,103 --> 04:38:07,615
Being like

5856
04:38:08,383 --> 04:38:09,663
Vaccine standard

5857
04:38:10,431 --> 04:38:10,943
Held with

5858
04:38:11,199 --> 04:38:12,223
People like Alex

5859
04:38:12,735 --> 04:38:13,503
People like Jordan

5860
04:38:13,759 --> 04:38:15,039
Peterson bio eunapolis

5861
04:38:16,575 --> 04:38:18,623
These people coming on Dave Rubin

5862
04:38:19,135 --> 04:38:19,647
Candice

5863
04:38:20,415 --> 04:38:20,927
These kinds of

5864
04:38:21,183 --> 04:38:21,695
People who are

5865
04:38:23,487 --> 04:38:24,767
People have an agenda

5866
04:38:25,535 --> 04:38:26,559
They aren't there to

5867
04:38:27,327 --> 04:38:27,839
Time

5868
04:38:28,095 --> 04:38:30,655
And f*** around and then whatever conversation happened

5869
04:38:31,423 --> 04:38:31,935
There there

5870
04:38:32,191 --> 04:38:32,703
To push something

5871
04:38:33,215 --> 04:38:33,727
And they

5872
04:38:33,983 --> 04:38:34,751
Exploit

5873
04:38:35,263 --> 04:38:36,031
Your position

5874
04:38:36,287 --> 04:38:36,799
Of like

5875
04:38:40,383 --> 04:38:41,407
And that is it like

5876
04:38:42,687 --> 04:38:43,199
Here's a

5877
04:38:43,967 --> 04:38:45,247
If you're listening

5878
04:38:46,271 --> 04:38:47,039
Go ahead and text

5879
04:38:47,807 --> 04:38:48,319
If

5880
04:38:48,575 --> 04:38:52,159
Somebody's somebody should be your friend

5881
04:38:52,415 --> 04:38:53,183
And I will tell you

5882
04:38:53,695 --> 04:38:54,463
Hard yes hard

5883
04:38:54,975 --> 04:38:55,743
Very simple

5884
04:38:55,999 --> 04:38:56,511
Alex

5885
04:38:56,767 --> 04:38:57,535
Shouldn't be your friend

5886
04:38:57,791 --> 04:38:59,327
Depart now the problem is

5887
04:38:59,583 --> 04:39:00,863
His principal or whatever he thinks

5888
04:39:01,119 --> 04:39:01,631
The show is

5889
04:39:02,399 --> 04:39:03,167
But it's a good idea

5890
04:39:03,423 --> 04:39:04,447
Yeah he has

5891
04:39:04,703 --> 04:39:05,215
People playing

5892
04:39:05,471 --> 04:39:06,239
Who are subverting

5893
04:39:06,495 --> 04:39:07,007
Format

5894
04:39:07,519 --> 04:39:08,543
In order to push something

5895
04:39:09,311 --> 04:39:10,079
Then he doesn't want to be

5896
04:39:10,335 --> 04:39:10,847
Associated

5897
04:39:11,615 --> 04:39:12,127
He becomes a soul

5898
04:39:13,919 --> 04:39:16,223
The extent to which is a willing participant

5899
04:39:16,479 --> 04:39:17,503
Or

5900
04:39:17,759 --> 04:39:18,527
A victim of it

5901
04:39:18,783 --> 04:39:20,319
I don't care I have no idea how much

5902
04:39:20,575 --> 04:39:21,087
That is okay

5903
04:39:21,599 --> 04:39:23,135
Either way proof of the pudding is in the

5904
04:39:23,391 --> 04:39:24,671
And the response

5905
04:39:24,927 --> 04:39:25,695
And the end effect

5906
04:39:25,951 --> 04:39:26,719
Is that

5907
04:39:26,975 --> 04:39:27,743
Negative message

5908
04:39:29,279 --> 04:39:29,791
Negative message

5909
04:39:30,303 --> 04:39:31,071
Skip perpetuated

5910
04:39:31,327 --> 04:39:32,607
And go unchallenged

5911
04:39:33,119 --> 04:39:33,887
And that is what we

5912
04:39:34,655 --> 04:39:35,167
Thomas episode

5913
04:39:35,935 --> 04:39:36,447
So I would like to end

5914
04:39:37,983 --> 04:39:38,495
Joe Rogan

5915
04:39:41,055 --> 04:39:41,567
And Alex

5916
04:39:44,895 --> 04:39:45,407
Joe

5917
04:39:46,943 --> 04:39:47,455
Come on man

5918
04:39:49,503 --> 04:39:50,015
Alex

5919
04:39:51,039 --> 04:39:53,855
Hope you die bro like this

5920
04:39:54,111 --> 04:39:56,159
Hope you don't have a heart attack by 55

5921
04:39:56,415 --> 04:39:56,927
Find

5922
04:39:57,183 --> 04:39:58,975
Hope you have a heart attack

5923
04:40:00,767 --> 04:40:04,351
Well there's still time

5924
04:40:04,607 --> 04:40:07,679
Anyway

5925
04:40:11,775 --> 04:40:12,287
Weaver

5926
04:40:16,127 --> 04:40:18,431
We also have a Twitter

5927
04:40:18,687 --> 04:40:24,831
We are on Facebook

5928
04:40:25,855 --> 04:40:31,999
We're on iTunes we're on overcast we're on Dog the Bounty Hunter next week is that

5929
04:40:32,255 --> 04:40:38,399
Well then we're not review

5930
04:40:38,655 --> 04:40:41,215
Tetra tell your friends I don't know

5931
04:40:41,727 --> 04:40:44,031
This might be a terrible

5932
04:40:45,567 --> 04:40:46,079
The plugs and

5933
04:40:51,967 --> 04:40:54,015
No it's kind of bonus

5934
04:40:54,783 --> 04:40:55,295
I get

5935
04:40:55,807 --> 04:40:56,575
There will be some

5936
04:40:56,831 --> 04:40:57,343
Some criticism of

5937
04:40:57,855 --> 04:40:59,903
Hey Eugene cover when Alex said this

5938
04:41:00,159 --> 04:41:00,671
Or whatever

5939
04:41:03,999 --> 04:41:04,511
Okay

5940
04:41:04,767 --> 04:41:08,863
We could not cover covers the entire episode

5941
04:41:09,119 --> 04:41:10,143
Without doing 10 hours

5942
04:41:10,399 --> 04:41:16,543
Yeah I was going to say we covered the stuff that matters over all the clips

5943
04:41:16,799 --> 04:41:17,311
In an hour

5944
04:41:18,079 --> 04:41:18,847
Would you say

5945
04:41:19,615 --> 04:41:20,895
And we did about

5946
04:41:21,151 --> 04:41:23,199
Four and a half hours

5947
04:41:23,455 --> 04:41:24,479
Bulk

5948
04:41:24,735 --> 04:41:26,015
Of the actual show

5949
04:41:28,831 --> 04:41:29,855
An hour

5950
04:41:30,111 --> 04:41:30,623
Worth of

5951
04:41:30,879 --> 04:41:31,903
Actual audio from the

5952
04:41:36,767 --> 04:41:37,279
If you think

5953
04:41:37,791 --> 04:41:38,303
Uncover something

5954
04:41:38,559 --> 04:41:39,327
You think is important

5955
04:41:39,839 --> 04:41:40,607
Ask yourself

5956
04:41:40,863 --> 04:41:43,167
Is it something we've covered on our show a bunch

5957
04:41:45,215 --> 04:41:45,727
That's a good question

5958
04:41:46,239 --> 04:41:46,751
If it's if it

5959
04:41:47,007 --> 04:41:48,031
It's not ask yourself a second

5960
04:41:48,799 --> 04:41:49,311
Does it matter

5961
04:41:49,567 --> 04:41:50,591
If you're new to the show

5962
04:41:51,103 --> 04:41:51,615
Start from the

5963
04:41:53,663 --> 04:41:56,735
And that good luck

5964
04:41:56,991 --> 04:42:00,319
And take two years to listen to it because if you've Mainline it there is some

5965
04:42:00,575 --> 04:42:01,087
Some trouble

5966
04:42:01,343 --> 04:42:02,367
Don't do that

5967
04:42:03,903 --> 04:42:04,927
We love you I would say

5968
04:42:05,695 --> 04:42:06,207
That

5969
04:42:06,463 --> 04:42:07,231
Eddie Bravo

5970
04:42:07,487 --> 04:42:07,999
Is a choke outs

5971
04:42:09,279 --> 04:42:09,791
But I don't think you

5972
04:42:10,047 --> 04:42:10,559
He's killed anybody

5973
04:42:10,815 --> 04:42:12,351
I think we would have known if Eddie Bravo

5974
04:42:14,143 --> 04:42:14,911
I think it would be in the

5975
04:42:15,935 --> 04:42:16,447
Authorities would

5976
04:42:18,495 --> 04:42:19,519
Describe the almost

5977
04:42:20,031 --> 04:42:21,055
A guy in this episode

5978
04:42:21,567 --> 04:42:22,591
Great detail

5979
04:42:22,847 --> 04:42:23,359
And that's not what I'm

5980
04:42:24,639 --> 04:42:25,151
Because he is also

5981
04:42:25,407 --> 04:42:25,919
Technically

5982
04:42:26,431 --> 04:42:28,223
Probably actually killed somebody

5983
04:42:31,295 --> 04:42:33,599
Holding

5984
04:42:35,647 --> 04:42:39,231
