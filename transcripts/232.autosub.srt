1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey buddy Dan here I just want to

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08,960
Before we start this episode again

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
You want it all

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,800
We're going to be going over today drift

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,360
Pretty deeply into stuff that would

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
Rightfully be called offensive to most people

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
Some of the content that we end up covering

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
Is a very homophobic

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,136
Even to a violent

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
That you

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Have no tolerance for I totally understand and

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,816
I would advise maybe this is not the episode for you

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,656
Let's jump here is the episode

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
Holding

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Alex

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Little bit by Alex to Jordan I realized that I forgot

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
I left

18
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
Because of that moment like

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
Being in the theater and laughing that hard

20
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Was

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Transformer

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
Yeah I don't know I don't know

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
I don't know what kind of answer to

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Give because there's good movies that he's.

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Sounds really good

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,808
You could say that or any Port of Call New Orleans Bad Lieutenant

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
They're so different

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Performances

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
I don't know

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
Wicker man's great

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,632
Range of movies that I can't choose one that's my favorite

32
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
But I'll probably say the

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,456
It's a close tie

34
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Between man and Matchstick Men

35
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
As I thought.

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
A boy like you Leona

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
I would not say

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Love Taylor

39
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,656
She was great bad boy

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
About sex

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
I don't know there's some NBC show that she was on those really great

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
But it was married

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Duchovny

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Really

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
Californication

46
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
I don't know

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
This is the same thing I don't know much about the personal life of David Duchovny

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
Kind of Arts

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
Forgetting to the show proper I'd like to take a moment

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
The show

51
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
We appreciate it very much

52
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
So first I'd like to

53
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
You are now a policy wonk

54
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm a policy wonk

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
Thanksgiving could not be spelled differently

56
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
Also would like to say thank you so much

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
You are now policy walk

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
I'm a policy wonk

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,664
Make it back

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
Acknowledge

61
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
The button

62
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,576
Talk to support the show click that button help us out Keep On The Lights

63
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Is basa another Park

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,816
The reason to carry Cassidy trigger something in my brain is because someone posted

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
On Arts Booker

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
A link to Kerry Cassidy

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
That she made

68
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
With a Project Camelot

69
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
I didn't realize that that was publicly available

70
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
Next documentary no

71
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
It was really awesome

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Because I've been looking for a really long time

73
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
For the connection between Project Camelot

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
And this guy named Andrew basiago

75
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,655
He's a particular crazy that I'm really into

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
War that I've seen

77
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
Interview

78
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,639
It's not

79
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
The pilot

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
So that's

81
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
Anyway Andrew basiago claims that he's gone he was a part of

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Secret program when he was a kid

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
They teleported to Tamar's twice

84
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Which is

85
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Most extreme thing

86
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
He also

87
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Wet with Barack Obama

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,399
Eman Barack Obama were kids and they went to the Demars

89
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
Let alone

90
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
That's awesome also Andrew basiago

91
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,103
But he's a half dolphin Warrior and can breathe underwater

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Alright that one

93
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,759
I guess he has a lot going on

94
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Really like

95
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
To cover

96
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
I can't find episode

97
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Baba Yaga

98
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
So crazy

99
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
How do I

100
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Jordan is not a project

101
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,727
We're now on the other side of the Obama Deception

102
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
What are the things that I really want to do is I want to open up the when's

103
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
Wednesday episode a lot more

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,991
We've done a lot of Jim Bakker who done a lot of Project Camelot we've tried to dip our toes and other places

105
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
It hasn't really worked all that well generally speaking

106
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
There's a lot of shows aren't the same vibe

107
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
I did

108
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
I watched

109
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
So many bad shows

110
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
To prepare for this

111
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
I watched so many shows that I'm like

112
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Nah

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Not right

114
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
Two guys a girl and a pizza place really good

115
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Ryan Reynolds

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Traylor Howard

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Weather

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
Huge crush on Traylor Howard as a child

119
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,599
One of them was a show called radical agenda with Chris Cantwell

120
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Is the Nazi

121
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
Who is featured in that Vice documentary Charlottsville

122
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,767
Who then I started crying whole bunch when he had to go to jail

123
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
Yo I listen to so because

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
He's an out right now.

125
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
I was like

126
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
But he said he's not

127
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,007
Nationalist

128
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
He takes that moniker

129
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
Easy to find a lot of similarities of Alex in this

130
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
And turn off there is one episode we talked about how libertarianism

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Is the gateway to white supremacy

132
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,159
Bingo he hasn't episode where he interviews Simon roast

133
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Who Alex's had on a bunch

134
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
The Swede launder who

135
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
What's a pedal white genocide narratives

136
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
No it's not it's not good

137
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
He's not running

138
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Anywhere's is white

139
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:11,103
It's kind of a situation where

140
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,247
Text yourself against our particular form of

141
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
Know what how to cover it

142
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Revisited

143
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
There's a whole bunch

144
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Bird Box

145
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,839
And so I thought about it another time would be

146
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
To explore some of Alex's guest

147
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
That we have it

148
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Floored

149
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Or maybe we touch down a little bit

150
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Hey give me a chance

151
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
The deal with

152
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Some of my favorite crazy

153
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
So everyone knows my favorite crazy

154
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Is

155
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
Darrell Hammond photo

156
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Because he is a guy

157
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Who is illegitimate

158
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Professor

159
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
He was doing some real

160
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,159
Important research in the decentralisation of Asian-American been

161
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
In our culture

162
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
He's pink guitar and the Illuminati

163
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Is a charge of all schools

164
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Lynda Carter

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
The president of UC Davis as a bunch of

166
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
I love the guy

167
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
We're not going to talk about him

168
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
We're going to talk about my second-favorite

169
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Experience.

170
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Alex Jones

171
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Before

172
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
It is Reverend

173
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
James David Mann

174
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
That's crazy

175
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Reverend Manning

176
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,167
He is someone who has been a guest on Alex Jones Show since at least 2010

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Optel Trump's election

178
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Turned on Trump

179
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
I called some tribulation Trump

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
Answer. He's not welcome back on Alex's

181
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,015
For that six years he was gas to come on on a fairly regular basis

182
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
Beyond that he's also appeared on Michael Savage show

183
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
He has been on Gavin McInnes show

184
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
I found another

185
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,583
They talked about her

186
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
We won't be listening to any of that

187
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
But

188
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
I feel like in the time that we talked about Reverend man

189
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
We haven't really dealt with

190
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Awful app

191
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
And in this episode

192
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
2

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Layout for you and demonstrate

194
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Exactly

195
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
How crazy is

196
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,767
That sounds right

197
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Upfront today is exploration

198
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Of Reverend James David Manning

199
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,943
I am not or I am now

200
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Isabel

201
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:12,095
That's the real

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Give you a little bit of a sign I want to be in his congregation so bad that sounds like way more fun

203
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Welcome

204
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:29,247
What do white people that much

205
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Also hate black people

206
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Reverend Manning is one of the most

207
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
3 tool player bigots

208
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Piano keys

209
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Triple threat

210
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
He hates everybody right

211
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Everybody

212
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
It's pretty pretty remarkable

213
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Disability

214
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Particularly of virulence

215
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Homophobe

216
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
We'll deal with that but

217
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Comes to us

218
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
From

219
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
What species do

220
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
And the reason that I chose to start with this

221
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Call me Obama

222
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Open coverage

223
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
You made the ark

224
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
That the first two years of Obama's term

225
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
We're linchpin

226
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,815
You believe that you saying you were going to write a doctoral thesis on it

227
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
If you ever go back to school

228
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
I remember so little for that you recommended

229
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Here is what he has to say about the first two years of Obama

230
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
The first two years of the Obama

231
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
He released a homosexual

232
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Pickup

233
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Throw me off of YouTube

234
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
He released the homosexual

235
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
And they were

236
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
And then the first two years of Donna

237
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,607
Which is worse or which is better

238
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,239
I love it I love it

239
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Freaky

240
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Sex

241
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:33,151
I imagine like it's a snake demon with a lampshade on his head

242
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Bottom half of a horse costume

243
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,159
I don't know why it on the head is like my go-to for freaky but

244
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
Comes from a very particular time in pop culture

245
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
And he doesn't there's an interesting

246
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Think that he

247
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Does

248
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Point out for him

249
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Specific

250
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Is that

251
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
What he says

252
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Saying homosexual is bad

253
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Just like staying the

254
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
The word homosexual is good for him in particular just like a heart

255
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Yeah

256
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,671
For you it is bad

257
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
People to use

258
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
I don't know

259
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
I don't think I've ever run into anybody was like

260
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Homosexual is a

261
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Everybody

262
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Bad about it

263
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,503
But I went down when I was trying to

264
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Figure out

265
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
How we could expand

266
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
Was I started listening to a bunch of Stefan molyneux

267
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Of course possessed by psychotic freak

268
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,351
Would you like me to watch a guy stare into a camera space

269
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
Every zombie

270
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Watching Stefan molyneux

271
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,287
Watching I started to remember how he likes to see people who uses contact

272
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
I don't want to f*** with this quarter end up covering

273
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
Even if we're well within our rights to

274
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
I still just don't want the headache

275
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
But

276
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
I found

277
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
He's pretty obsessed with pop color

278
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
And

279
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:26,047
I watched a pretty long video very poorly breaks out the Showbox

280
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,823
Is talking about how great Inception is

281
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
And that leads us to this next clip

282
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
Which is from Reverend Manning

283
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
And

284
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
What I'm trying to get a lot of these guys love Pop Culture but they're really mad at it because it doesn't reflect what they want it to refresh

285
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,815
They spend a lot of their time with these really high-minded things like Reverend

286
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
But also

287
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Needs to take time out of his day

288
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
You cursed Lena Dunham

289
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Okay

290
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Do something here

291
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
Literally

292
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
In the

293
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
End the place of

294
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Those of us

295
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
This is worse than Obama.

296
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
It's worse than Obama.

297
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Stop

298
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
I heard like

299
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
That's probably

300
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
He's talking about when Lena Dunham

301
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
And also I couldn't find the Ross YouTube video that put some music

302
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Swelling

303
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
It does address

304
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Star Lena Dunham

305
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
In Saturday Night Live

306
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Should not be allowed to get away

307
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
On way with

308
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
And

309
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Response

310
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,423
Is.

Hamsters

320

Continue to

A people to mock the word of God all the producer

326
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
Female daughters

327

Nieces

328
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
Show me how the Lord Jesus Christ and I'll bind you

329
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Under the power of the authority that almighty God has given to those that believe him

330
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
Saturday Night Live from mocking the word of God and you shall see

331
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
I mean

332
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
I guess I was worried that he was texted alot of things

333
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,415
Escape person everybody

334
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
Read the Bible

335
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,071
May your organs be filled with hemorrhoids

336
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Hemorrhoids pickles become as rocks

337
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
And every time you walk

The sound of the rocks of your testicles as you want but you will find it

342
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
And everyone will know that you have participated in the mocking of God's word

343
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,591
Actual statements out of a your own

344
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Debauchery

345
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
The beauty of God's creation

346
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
And the man and wife relationship

347
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
The God Almighty is put into the Earth be Eucharist with them rods and the

348

In the Saturday Night Live has profited from it as well

I am the Lord's servant

352
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
Did not work

355
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
Do you have to be in within a certain

356
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
Distance bright right

357
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,679
And I feel a little weird about

358
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
Hey man you didn't like SNL and you spent that long

359
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
A problem occurs

360
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Adult

361
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
It's that was well-written I don't think so

362
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
From listening to Reverend Manning

363
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
I think he's rich

364
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Making s*** up

365
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
Really got to use in keeping with the Bible in that women have this horrifying terrible

366
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
People when they see you they're going to know you were at

367
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
Your balls are loud

368
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Universal like

369
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Manning is

370
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Obsessed with cursing Lena Dunham

371
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
You know you got Alex Jones

372
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Complaints about

373
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,671
Pop culture

374
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
It's everywhere

375
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Because

376
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
It's not there

377
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
They don't

378
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Controller

379
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Like they steal it

380
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,167
Completely run by the other side

381
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
It's the Jews doing it

382
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,639
Women

383
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,503
A TV shows like so many of them are failed

384
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
Stand-ups

385
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:17,696
Yeah it's like all of them tried because they don't understand or have any concept

386
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Humor or

387
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
And also the pie

388
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,008
Workout

389
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
So yeah it must be people have failed

390
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
In the past

391
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,296
It's kind of like their entire world is a persona

392
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
The personification of their own failure

393
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
How they're fighting ghosts

394
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,024
And their need to blame their failure on every other person

395
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
That ever lived

396
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
We talked about

397
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Steve episode in 20

398
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
I think that's the one we covered him on

399
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
That's if you're a little more

400
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
He was talking about

401
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
You know how

402
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Starbucks

403
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
Was putting Stephen Peeples

404
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Maybe maybe not

405
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,656
That is unclear that to convection

406
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,080
There was some backlash from that and really dumb

407
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
And saying they put animals

408
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Another latte

409
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Riverbend

410
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Kids claims

411
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
Are we going line-by-line

412
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
I say do you go to hell

413
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Let's go

414
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,704
But I've got something

415
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Starbucks

416
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Sisters

417
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
Adam senior heard my writing

418
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
And statements regarding

419
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Starbucks

420
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Angela MMA

421
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
NC

422
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,136
Best Buy sound

423
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,464
I'm firing over the bow of the Starbucks

424
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Coffee

425
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Enterprise

426
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,328
And if you're drinking Starbucks

427
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
If you're a woman

428
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
You might want

429
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Drinking Starbucks

430
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Drake

431
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,528
Your brilliance

432
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
And yeah

433
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,184
It's by marriage a some people just like to company dead

434
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
It was one of Starbucks

435
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
That impregnate

436
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
Alright now that's not fair that's not fair

437
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
This is trolling

438
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Are you I think that's yet

439
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,040
There's there's some instant

440
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
Because I don't think anybody's

441
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
You know better how stupid you are

442
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
The claim that drinking

443
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:36,352
This is something where he made this point I think he is,

444
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,776
But he got so much attention for it like

445
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
The people were making fun of him on the young

446
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
The post was writing about this dump

447
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Trying to

448
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Keep that attention call

449
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
I agree with you

450
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
There are a couple insta

451
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
Where it's like

452
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Yeah this is funny

453
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
You trying to be funny

454
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,752
How do you not give a follow-up on this evening

455
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
As a narrative

456
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,896
Absolutely

457
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Deleted data

458
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
I immediately think of open mike Eagles

459
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,064
Lyrica I looked up what Lena Dunham said and I shouldn't have and I'm out

460
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
We need somebody tweeted open

461
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
Israel interesting sort of overlap

462
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Of like

463
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
People who can't at all

464
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
Most people on the West Beltline

465
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
So it is it is astray

466
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
I told

467
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
This guy

468
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
What about

469
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,456
Also also

470
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Like I said

471
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Does not like like

472
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
She is

473
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
Awful

474
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Take it away video

475
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,304
It's comical on one level but also like bleed deeply troubling I believe that

476
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Speaking from the pulpit again

477
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
That's really not a good thing

478
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
But we got a problem

479
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
Black people got a problem

480
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Are you

481
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,856
Is this is this I'm not a racist

482
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
I don't know what to do

483
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
You can train them you can train a black man

484
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
You can train

485
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
I don't like that

486
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
I've no idea what he's talking about

487
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
That's nice

488
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
SeaWorld

489
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
They don't have mutton Africa that's the first thing he learned did wherever he learned bulshit from

490
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Some of the vocal flourishes are a little amusing today

491
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
Storical b******* like I'm going to allow him

492
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
The idea that Egypt isn't part of that for

493
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
I don't agree with him

494
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,944
But I'm going to allow it for the sake of this Beatdown I'm about to deliver

495
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Alright bring it up historical examples

496
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:47,744
Cuz the carthaginian empire was a very legit Naval power back-in-the-day boasting a fleet of at least 350

497
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
As early as 2:56 BC

498
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
According to historians

499
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Carthage is located in modern-day North Africa doesn't count

500
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,968
We should probably just look as far south as we can go

501
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,856
Interesting Lee speech remains have been found at sites like blombos cave in South Africa that date back to

502
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
At least 70,000

503
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,536
Which indicates that folks there were able to catch fish in the Stone Age

504
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:26,400
Contradict the prevailing theory that the inhabitants of the area at the time were incapable of using series

505
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Go that's a remarkable piece of archaeology

506
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,152
There's no evidence that used boats

507
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:44,064
Give me some sort of an idea of his canoe

508
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
Which was discovered in 1987

509
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,256
The canoe was found in Nigeria and radiocarbon dating a place the age of between 8500 and 8000 years old

510
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,400
That timeframe places to do food a canoe as the second oldest boat ever been found

511
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:03,264
In the entire world a full for thousand years older than any existing boats that we have

512
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
See that's how awful black people

513
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
They built their boats to even take into account that like Ethiopia had trade

514
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
Nonsense

515
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Because also there's another video

516
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
What I said Africans didn't have boats

517
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
They had a whole lot coastline

518
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,592
Over the holiday literally said

519
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,712
Bill Clinton was the first president to not have any military service

520
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
And I

521
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,856
I actually left the room place

522
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
That's crazy but you make me

523
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Pronouncement

524
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,744
Bravely and boldly enough

525
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,128
Most of the ones that

526
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Comes people's minds

527
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
Like when you think about it

528
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
Spanx pyramids

529
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
Ozymandias or I realize all that was like

530
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
Africa

531
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
Egypt

532
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
Enter the battlefield

533
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,168
Wants to prepare for us

534
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
Even with that caveat he is full of s***

535
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,056
We have to be at Monday

536
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,152
By my pronunciation is no good

537
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Church in the world

538
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Located in

539
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
Ethiopia it was built during the Kingdom of Aksum but which place has its construction between 109 48

540
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
4

541
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
There's the walls of Benin

542
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:01,536
Which were built buildings about 880 and they covered over 9000 miles

543
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,608
Is longer than the Great Wall of China at the time

544
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
The following is from an article in the guardian

545
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
In 1691

546
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
The rink open

547
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,360
Portuguese Captain who visited the capital of Benin

548
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
Great Benin where the king resides is larger than Lisbon

549
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
All the Streets Run straight

550
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
As far as the eye can see

551
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,856
The houses are large especially that of the king which is richly decorated

552
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
The city is wealthy and Industrial

553
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
It's so well governed his unknown

554
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
And people live in such security that they have no doors

555
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,632
In contrast London at the time as described by Bruce

556
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
Holsinger professor of English at the University of Virginia

557
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,544
Is being a city of quotes thievery prostitution murder bribery

558
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,176
Black Market made the medieval

559
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
You're picking up hockey

560
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Stop

561
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,648
Is Timbuktu in Mali is considered a precious intellectual and

562
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Spiritual Center

563
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,048
The city contains many mosques now protected as World historical site

564
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,352
University of sankore as well as just

565
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Thumbs up

566
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Non one-story building

567
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,240
There's plenty more examples that this should make it pretty clear that African history is

568
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,824
Accomplishment

569
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
One of the issues is just prejudice

570
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
But it goes a little bit deeper than that

571
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
In the case of Benin City really illustrates why

572
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Benin city was designed mathematically

573
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,440
They designed based on a fractal design patterns repeat on smaller and larger

574
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Scales

575
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,536
The city is a whole head of design it was mirrored in the cluster of houses

576
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
To the city

577
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Then cluster of houses

578
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
And then that would be mirrored again

579
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
Open the houses themselves

580
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
The rooms within the house

581
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
Mathematics competition Ron English puts it this way

582
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,408
When Europeans first came to Africa they considered the architecture very disorganized invest

583
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,016
It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using the form of mathematics they haven't eaten

584
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
They haven't even discovered yet

585
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,208
Vera white places like Benin City reach what we would call the Renaissance

586
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Before the West

587
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,608
It boasted deeply complex Civic structure as well as public patronage of artists and Craftsman

588
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
Spoiler alert

589
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,264
It's the climb quote

590
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,568
Link to the increasing European intrusion

591
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
And slave trade at the borders of the

592
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
7 Empire

593
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
In 1897 the British Burn the City to the ground

594
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
And wizard went much of the history in the body

595
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Greater than the West

596
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Well not all of it

597
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
A selection of bronze sculptures from overtaking

598
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
Are now housed at the British museum in London

599
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
An example of how

600
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
Forgot even if the opportunity to make tourism income

601
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,216
You know what I want

602
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,824
Is Ciroc I would even go so far as to say that maybe

603
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
We don't talk about this

604
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Or learn about it

605
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
And instead learn about how Superior the white man is

606
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Because the white man

607
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
I'm going to go out and limb here and say and say that they want to control history to make them look

608
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,768
Possible and then justify their idea of this this great City that

609
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
It was really well Ron and very safe

610
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
Resources

611
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
The idea that like

612
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Because of European

613
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,944
You don't want to teach that sort of thing

614
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
The lessons are in Port

615
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:40,928
Just was it last week that that dude went over to the tribe

616
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
Right most people are

617
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Is

618
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
But what you're actually doing is in

619
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
You're risking

620
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
A genocide

621
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
Basically

622
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
And not to say is it Portuguese

623
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,736
People showing up at Benin was going to risk it beside or anything

624
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Directions

625
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
The destruction

626
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
The entire

627
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,232
Can I meet the worst phrase in history is and then the white man

628
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,632
Any history book you read

629
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
And everything was better

630
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Send that out to

631
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
The colonialist

632
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
It's kind of a moot point

633
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
It takes it outside of the realm of like

634
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Where you're going to trigger

635
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
People with wide-eyed

636
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Don't have the

637
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Implicit

638
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
External appearance

639
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Anti-whites

640
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Colonialist

641
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Ruined

642
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,432
It ruined a well-established City like

643
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Like it did

644
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,064
But there's there's no way around it waits until white people went to some place

645
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,184
And decided to impose their culture because they assumed that everybody there was

646
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
Differently unless they're forced

647
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,072
Misunderstood the organization was there

648
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
And wound up

649
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Destroying

650
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Now

651
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,008
Everybody of course has learned their lesson from that history and we don't

652
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Continue to do this

653
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
To do that to this day right

654
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Now we need to send

655
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
Betta is just a demonstration

656
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
Reverend Manning knows nothing about African history

657
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
Demonizing black people

658
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Because of his misunderstand

659
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Of African dust

660
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,792
That's

661
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
Like African history is

662
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Intricately tied up with Matt

663
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Big big parks

664
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
We should really learn more about that

665
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Going to have to look for

666
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,576
We just kind of the disappointing part by that

667
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,160
It is what it is really Nails home that

668
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,768
Anytime anytime somebody's like we have a white History Month

669
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
And you're like well every month is White History Month

670
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
One-story

671
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,800
There's more than I can get in

672
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Yeah

673
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
Where my

674
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,224
Understanding expertise

675
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Like just the eye

676
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
You could just take the idea of that f****** 9000 mile long wall

677
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Ha

678
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
F***** up

679
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,608
God

680
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
Really f***** everything up

681
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Find Portuguese

682
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,360
This should be your first indication that Reverend Manning

683
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
If you absorb

684
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Guys fun

685
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,624
Anti-black tirade

686
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
After that

687
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
Got a maybe

688
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,376
This next website

689
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Cause for Paws

690
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,728
It's like

691
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Oh no

692
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
The other day I was talk

693
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
I was talking about

694
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
And I'll talk

695
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
Is the oldest guy

696
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
A small-time Italian

697
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
The right

698
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
I'm so

699
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,640
I'll call him

700
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
What if

701
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
What is a couple

702
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,968
So I want I want

703
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
Backbend

704
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
Oh my God

705
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
But I can tell you this

706
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:17,056
Put it in her mouth

707
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
It was just me

708
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
She don't get no mercy

709
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
It just all she's a woman

710
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,008
I really thought he was repenting here

711
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
I don't want any misunderstanding

712
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
The sword of David

713
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
Not the only from there

714
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
But I will take a

715
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,183
If the Lord orders man to

716
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
And put a sword in the mouth of a person right now

717
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
I'll do it

718
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
So what's the difference

719
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,935
The difference

720
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,519
Young hoodlum running mystery crazy as I can

721
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Liberty Bell

722
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
But God does on his server

723
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
To take the sword

724
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
Into the hearts of people.

725
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,231
No I don't know

726
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
God tells me to take the floor

727
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,935
And put it in your mouth I will do it and I didn't tell me put that shotgun

728
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Hayden

729
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
Alabama missing

730
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,599
I'm more scared now so much more

731
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:11,999
That was

732
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
If

733
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,375
I will still kill you

734
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
I don't want people to think I've gone soft

735
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,223
Because of his ideas of that God is telling me through

736
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
Yeah

737
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,975
Curse the writers of SNL withdrawn balls and their children with

738
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
Yeah I don't

739
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Because a bad dude

740
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,983
That's really f****** scared

741
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,223
That is the worst repentance I think I've ever heard in my entire life

742
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Right

743
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,927
No this is him sitting at his webcam

744
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,487
He does he does B's video blogs

745
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
What I want I want

746
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
Search so bad I would go to that New York.

747
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
The Bronx

748
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
Harlem Harley

749
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
Pizza Hut I will fly to Harlem every Sunday

750
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Has not taken

751
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,927
Because his old channel was called

752
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
Which is the name of his church

753
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
80 lakh

754
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,567
The first one with an H

755
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
YouTube

756
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
If you get outsmarted

757
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
You deserve every

758
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:19,743
If the audience

759
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Episode

760
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
Looking into

761
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:29,983
He has a lot of sermons that I can find so there is material that we could talk

762
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,895
Turn off will not this time

763
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
Reverend David Manning

764
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
That's crazy

765
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,655
Avoid

766
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:09,663
Now what Pharmaceuticals game

767
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,319
No this is less about selling something

768
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,391
River Manning fancies himself a bit of a

769
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:27,071
He sells personalized healing doesn't really like from a distance

770
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,679
Pray for you or some s*** right complicated call course

771
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Didn't

772
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,079
Realize this and I think it might be sort of a newer addition to his his preaching repertoire

773
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,151
Because when I looked into his last time

774
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Hear him talking about

775
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Everything

776
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
Everything

777
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,599
He yells about diabetes

778
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Powers

779
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,487
Hate diabetes

780
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
Don't go out

781
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
That people don't realize that they're under

782
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Strip

783
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
That don't real

784
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Stretch

785
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
Stroke

786
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
At least

787
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Stroke

788
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
And his love

789
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,655
I'm living

790
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Fight

791
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,775
Aruba

792
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Is a game

793
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Sterno

794
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
I'm not going to

795
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:15,871
Is get back now to the Moon

796
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
Numerological

797
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:30,975
Looking back in the numerology in the middle of a video that you posted

798
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:37,375
Explain the blood moon

799
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,007
I watch this whole hour long video like what you say about the blood moon

800
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
I can cure diabetes

801
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:59,903
Going to

802
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,999
Say that this is his official nickname but I'm

803
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Alright

804
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:10,399
He doesn't have a mustache in my head and I can see him with it without him

805
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
Okay

806
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
Absolutely

807
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,407
Wrestling shoot promo on diabetes

808
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,503
Give me show up at Madison

809
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Square Garden on Sunday

810
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
He wait

811
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
As if it was aware

812
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:39,583
Does he believe diabetes is an entity that has conscious

813
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
I think so yes

814
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
It's for diabetes

815
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,335
Princess Diane Beach

816
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
Just really feel like it's personified

817
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:04,159
I mean I'm sure he does but it's not even like it either bacterial or something like that right right

818
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
This is one of those things

819
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,535
It really illustrates

820
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Allstate Tucson

821
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
And that's one of the things I should say

822
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
His options

823
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
In terms of another wacky cover is Jesse Lee

824
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Lee Peterson

825
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
And I'm not

826
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Going to cover

827
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
He is a guy who is a real Trump

828
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Assholes

829
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Radio

830
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Show guy

831
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,735
But the way he speaks

832
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
Leads me to believe that he is absolutely had a stroke

833
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
He has like

834
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Diminished

835
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,255
If you watch

836
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Like 5 minutes

837
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,447
I think there's something wrong with his brain

838
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
It's not it's not

839
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
Jesse Lee Peterson

840
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Jesse Lee Peterson

841
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Worried

842
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,759
To talk about

843
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Manning

844
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
The end of this

845
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
You will encourage any

846
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,767
Manning has that mental illness the same way that Alex

847
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Has

848
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
Clear paranoid schizophrenic tend

849
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,263
Where's Mike Manning

850
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
All history of Africa is

851
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
Until the white man came

852
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:36,319
I really wish people would be forced to like learn

853
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Reverend Manning

854
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Diabetes

855
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Is on his

856
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,327
Yes

857
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
Africa

858
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
Producers and writers of SNL

859
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
Not the daytime player

860
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
Also gave

861
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,223
About diabetes Now

862
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
She explains how he can

863
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
Protect you

864
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Broad stroke

865
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,463
I want to talk about the deal with this more tomorrow

866
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,279
Blood moon

867
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,423
We're Friday

868
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
The Sabbath

869
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,823
But most people call Fred about

870
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
71

871
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
+ 7

872
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
I got a positive real quick

873
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,047
What is talking about

874
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
Information

875
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Got about the blood moons are

876
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,775
He was staying at a hotel in Indianapolis numbers

877
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
7073

878
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
76 I believe

879
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
Where the highway is that he drove on

880
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
And he's describing some sort of like

881
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Metaphysical

882
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
He's creating some sort of like

883
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
Important sautters it

884
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
He never explains what he's talking about

885
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
Just 70

886
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Those are Highway

887
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
Future talking about is

888
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:25,631
911 01

889
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,679
That's as high level

890
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
The 37

891
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
The Seven Dwarfs

892
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
And the 7th

893
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,687
Also will get

894
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:44,831
Biggest highways in the Midwest

895
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,391
A lot of those routes are numerical

896
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
As a way of organizing

897
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,767
So this is where you will get

898
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,167
Team is it's not like triple ones means a lot

899
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,311
Nope nope no future here

00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
On the

901
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,151
Of the trust in the Lord hour

902
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,991
That's another 180

903
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
How long do you have to trust in the Lord

904
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:20,671
Stop the blood moon appear already kept me in the room Staybridge Hotel

905

Like 20 times

907
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Either he's bragging

908
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,703
Like it's a good hotel and not sure I have no idea

909
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:37,823
He has a little bit of an ad Revenue coming in

910
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,407
Talking to the Holy Spirit like God was talking to him in a hotel room

911
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,807
Diabetic coma

912
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,023
City sees the blood moon

913
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Right

914
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,167
They told me that

915
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
That you don't want

916
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
Find yourself

917
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
And having

918
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,783
That's a bad thing

919
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
Leslie for Randstad

920
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
You get rid of

921
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
I don't know

922
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,959
Interstate

923
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
New York City

924
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,823
Washington d.c.

925
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:47,455
You thought he wasn't going to

926
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
What's up

927
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Hold on

928
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
No

929
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Instructed

930
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
If you would listen to the word of God listen to me

931
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
The sweet

932
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
At any rate

933
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Before getting in your car

00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,167
Amen

935
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,007
You can listen while you're sleeping

936
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:46,079
YouTube put all in the report

937
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,967
Of the visitors list

938
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,063
This is an advertising strategy

939
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,183
I don't want people to move everyone out

940
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,023
While you were listening you will not have a stroke I promise you that

941
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:11,679
I can't promise you won't ever thrown a car

942
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
Stats

943
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,847
Awesome if you don't want to eat you don't have a stroke while you're sleeping either so you better listen to go to sleep

944
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
Tomorrow

When you go to sleep

947
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,863
But you're going into your subconscious

948
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
Yeah

949
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
I like

950
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
This a lot

951
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Their terms of Manning

952
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Evolution

953
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,175
Please be calm.

954
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
If you listen to my show

955
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
Alright buddy

956
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
This problem when someone has a

957
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,439
Another stroke it's going to be tough

958
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,303
You know what good that's the trick of the that's the trick of Jesus's

959
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
That's on you you didn't believe in Jesus

960
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:18,239
Is that possibility stigmatized

961
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,079
It's not a stroke or something like that

962
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
Uno

963
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
Community like a

964
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
Is a great place to go if you have

965
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Because there's Fellowship

966
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
There's people who care about you maybe cookie

967
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,111
You meals and stuff like that

968
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,975
Never admit you have cancer because that would be an indication that you haven't been listening

969
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,607
To all you do is encourage secrecy and people being ashamed

970
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,359
But Manning about the church that is

971
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
Like no matter how much

972
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,967
Amb relentlessly anti-religion

973
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
My uncle is in the hospital right now

974
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,855
And the only reason that he like survived that night

975
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
Where he was

976
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
You know

977
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,951
We all of that should happen

978
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Was because

979
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Call dispatch

980
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
After dropping to the

981
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:18,143
You do like the good

982
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
Yeah

983
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,263
Community you could find out

984
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,103
Someone for finding it there is a lot of value

985
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,503
The pastor that he drove to the hospital is virulence

986
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:38,879
There's no wind there's no punch out.

987
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
And if you listen to the show

988
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
You won't

989
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
Get a stroke

990
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,767
Probably heart attack also it's kind of a

991
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:51,679
What about later

992
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:59,615

993
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407

Reverend Manning

997
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
Spelling

998
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Immortality

999
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
To his left

1000

1001
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703

Okay I want to show you something here

1003
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
Alright

1004
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,359
I want to show you something

1005
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
I want to show you

1006
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,367
What is a tribulation birth certificate

1007
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
Is

1008
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,535
Looks like

1009
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Certificate

1010
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,711
The Bible

1011
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
The power

1012
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Abyss verse

1013
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,463
28th the 28th of August to the 20th of September

1014
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
God

1015
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,943
What

1016
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,735
Your soul is already clean

1017
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
Issue

1018
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,327
Issue

1019
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,263
He wants to save you

1020
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
Yeah we got it

1021
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,527
He's always

1022
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
Speedway Houston

1023
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
He sent me

1024
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
A boat

1025
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,215
Contender boats

1026
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,223
For your house

1027
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Do what you need to do

1028
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
And you need to put it up over your goal

1029
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
You know over the top of your door

1030
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,351
So when you walk out your house you walk out

1031
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
To avoid being ran over by a bridge

1032
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,847
Distance on a long time and I'll just tell you so what what's up

1033
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
When he was fighting diabetes hard of his without allergic

1034
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:25,439
Be run over by a bread truck preoccupied with bread

1035
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
I feel like

1036
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,607
That clip a lot of questions unanswered

1037
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:39,007
So I feel like what we should do now that comes from a really long clip and I wanted to pay

1038
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Play all of it

1039
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
But

1040
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:46,431
I will not allow you to ask me some questions about what's going on here and I'll do my best to answer these questions and it stinks

1041
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,367
Bible

1042
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,415
How important is the gold

1043
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
0

1044
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,231
Not important.

1045
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Bible lies

1046
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,351
Do certificates have magical powers

1047
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
Bible

1048
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Good God almighty

1049
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
I apologize

1050
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,495
I apologize for not throwing that in there

1051
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:22,271
No matter how you adjust the microphone

1052
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
It's awesome

1053
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,623
If I needed someone to yell

1054
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,207
I probably still wouldn't get him but someone with his gills

1055
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,839
I recognize game

1056
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,655
The Flash

1057
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
Two by two

1058
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,983
It's like in the

1059
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:48,639
Bible verses from Matthew

1060
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
It won't taste death

1061
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
You'll be a witness to the

1062
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
The coming of the king

1063
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
That's the gist of the

1064
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:04,511
Then if a witness and I commit myself to be witness of the coming

1065
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
The kingdom of God

1066
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
Then I won't take

1067
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,263
So he's printed that Bible verse on a certificate and telling his audience

1068
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,311
That if you put up

1069
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:22,943
The door on the door that you go out of you can't be killed when you leave your house

1070
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
Which makes sense that

1071
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
Track

1072
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:30,111
That's so much like a remember the episode where those what was it

1073
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:38,047
No no no it's okay

1074
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,631
That makes more sense

1075
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
Because it's easier choice about vaccinations

1076
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,239
Victim of an

1077
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Accidental death

1078
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
Is not your choice

1079
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
I don't know if he has made anything more specific than you will not be the victim of a bread related

1080
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
I should say just

1081
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,463
Protect you from

1082
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,791
But he's not telling them really which is really weird

1083
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,887
In the middle of this Quest

1084
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,935
Like a extended clip

1085
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
He gets into a horse

1086
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Put it on

1087
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Underwear

1088
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,895
They won't dialect

1089
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
What

1090
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,951
Sharpie and write it on the underwear

1091
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,839
Hold on to the I think there's a lot of people who are going to be

1092
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:49,471
You're going to go out

1093
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,287
If you want them

1094
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,591
Send me a large envelope with stamps

1095
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
I just have to send it to

1096
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
If you sent me it with the

1097
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:10,207
The literary agent

1098
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
Visit

1099
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:16,607
He should be charging $50 for the price

1100
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
Send me an envelope

1101
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:23,519
I'll send them to you 3 cuz we got a printer and I like if you're going to send me

You're going to send me money so I can buy you an envelope and Stamp

1103
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:36,831

01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Pakistan

1138
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Nope

1139
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,151
Yeah it's almost all of his yells with I'm the Lord's servant

1140
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
Which is

1141
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,015
It's unsettling.

1142
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,879
Yelling at the vocal patterns

1143
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,487
Even that's not that awful

1144
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
Reading a bunch of people to fix it easily

1145
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Is there a penny in for a pound whatever

1146
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Mostly Steam

1147
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,359
Historical revisionism that's unfortunate but also like whatever

1148
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,663
He has a Congregation of like 70

1149
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
It's not like

1150
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:53,599
It's not like he hasn't

1151
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,135
Quirky Goofy

1152
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,951
Nonsense dangerous

1153
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,231
Because of like sort of

1154
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,447
Look up

1155
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:14,847
Okay

1156
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:21,247
Boats

1157
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
Look I don't want to break it

1158
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
Looking for Matthew so

1159
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,719
It's taken from the qsource wrecked it's a secondary level from the original

1160
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,047
Exactly

1161
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
What is about

1162
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,399
The people there who eventually saw

1163
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
Christ

1164
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Resurrection Eggs

1165
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,543
Another angle

1166
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,591
I don't know I don't know ever

1167
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,175
But I know that the flash is really not important

1168
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
2

1169
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:57,599
Christianity is not really there's a meat body

1170
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Important

1171
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
Isn't so much about the idea of you're not going

1172
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
It's not relevant

1173
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,167
Coming of the Kingdom

1174
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Lorde

1175
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
Through what important your spirit

1176
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,847
Deaf as a as a sentence as as it as a blip

1177
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,407
So you will not

1178
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
You will taste transcend

1179
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,759
Is that

1180
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Sojourn

1181
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:33,439
Ruin the f****** day

1182
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:38,815
Granddaughter

1183
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,143
Heard all the episodes know that like there's a real

1184
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Real kibosh coming

1185
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:49,055
There's a real Hammer that I've been holding over your head and I got to say

1186
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
If you're new

1187
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,127
Every episode is fun

1188
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,943
Until Dan decides to wreck Oliver spirit

1189
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,343
Just information

1190
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,487
Multiple pieces and this is where that it stops being as fun

1191
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,023
This next clip will be sort of

1192
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,095
Fun transition

1193
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
But I should warn you ahead of this clip

1194
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,703
Good pastimes it's not been fun

1195
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,775
This is a whole new level of nausea

1196
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
You're the bread truck of this episode yeah unfortunately

1197
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:29,247
You know I live in Harlem

1198
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:35,647
We are as African-Americans

1199
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,279
He's of the absence of males in the home

1200
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,071
80% of the homes

1201
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:47,167
African Americans are headed by women and there are no males

1202
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
And the homes

1203
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
Leading

1204
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,383
This doesn't sound like it's going to be

1205
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,943
This isn't going to end well I can sense this coming

1206
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:04,319
And so women are having a difficult

1207
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,975
2 million

1208
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
Mama

1209
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:42,207
Basketball player Michael Sam

1210
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,359
The closet

1211
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,991
Obama

1212
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,551
Has released the homo demons

1213
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,087
On the black

1214
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,135
Lookout black woman

1215
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,207
A white homo may take your man

1216
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,303
Is

1217
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
A new one

1218
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:27,263
That's it that's a weird races Southern Trope of like the black man's going to steal the white woman

1219
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:33,663
That is kind of the way it comes out

1220
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,223
It's weird

1221
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,831
It's just like a board on the ground

1222
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,111
It's like

1223
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,183
You know where you would normally see like I remember these

1224
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:51,583
The best vitamin B1

1225
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,935
What hormones are going to take you ladies look out like

1226
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:00,799
That's as far as something to walk by

1227
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:08,479
I wouldn't I wouldn't

1228
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,063
Could you have an interesting story to tell

1229
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,159
Watch now

1230
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
I have noticed

1231
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,935
Closet homosexual

1232
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,263
And they're being scooped up by

1233
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,895
Leaving the black

1234
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,711
Be her husband

1235
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
And father her children

1236
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:47,391
Also real fun part about this there's a lot more less in this clip doesn't recognize that

1237
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,695
It's possible for black women to date

1238
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,351
There is that like underlying racism that sort of never dealt with

1239
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
I just I'm just fascinated by The Rake

1240
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,447
System right now which is

1241
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
Black man black woman

1242
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
Number one

1243
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,823
Black man black man black man black man

1244
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,615
Not good no number two

1245
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,527
There isn't even a

1246
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,879
Because the white homosexual has convinced

1247
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
The black person

1248
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,439
Homosexual

1249
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:27,327
Burien from a black woman

1250
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,935
This is

1251
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:38,335
And to the black the black neighborhood

1252
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:42,431
Black men that have been homosexuality

1253
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:46,783
Black

1254
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,831
Hard time competing against

1255
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,415
White homosexual male

1256
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:58,815
American Express card

1257
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:05,215
Dinner parties

1258
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:11,103
What's the financial strength of a wife

1259
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
This is devastating

1260
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:21,087
Destruction

1261
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
The black

1262
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Family

1263
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,439
With his homosexual

1264
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,839
That

1265
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:45,151
Homosexuals have come out in the sports arena

1266
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,807
We support the president of Uganda

1267
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:58,207
German people

1268
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:02,047
Creations

1269
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,327
Thai

1270
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,887
Integrity

1271
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,239
Universal

1272
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
Thai if you will

1273
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:19,968
Established in our nation by this

1274
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,320
Barack Hussein Obama has powers

1275
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:28,416
Continue

1276
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Ford service

1277
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Wow

1278
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,304
How old is a wild ride

1279
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
I learned that if I

1280
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,424
Where to find out that I'm a homosexual

1281
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,824
To get rid of this you can't say that that's dangerous

1282
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Yeah

1283
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,176
Unfortunately that's a half a lot of paperwork

1284
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,808
Man

1285
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,904
Discover

1286
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
But

1287
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
But

1288
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,352
There's so much in there even if you take out the like

1289
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
Rank homophobe

1290
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
There's so much of my

1291
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,264
I mean I guess it's still part of the homophobia

1292
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,544
These white almost

1293
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
How can you compete

1294
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:25,504
Where is that

1295
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
So-so

1296
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,464
What I'm understanding like if I'm going to read between the lines

1297
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,280
Lucky's accurately describing

1298
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
Navigation

1299
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,936
Which is better

1300
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:49,056
Hey wealthier people are destroying black

1301
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,872
Like spiritually there's a piece of that

1302
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,688
Complain the way drunk

1303
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,248
Furthermore ascribing it

1304
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,808
Then woman's fault for not

1305
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Like in theater

1306
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
Which is weird

1307
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
That angers so

1308
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:10,048
It's funny when you talkin about

1309
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Semen in latte

1310
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
Like that

1311
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
That's funny

1312
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
But unfortunately

1313
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,032
And this next clip is a mic down clip

1314
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
It's something

1315
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,384
You need to recognize

1316
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
When you have people like

1317
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,712
Reverend James

1318
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,016
There's reality to what he preaches

1319
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,296
From the pulpit

1320
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
That is

1321
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,856
Unacceptable

1322
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,440
It's unacceptable to modern society

1323
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
It's important to recognize

1324
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
Listermann

1325
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,328
He was a guest on Alex Jones Show

1326
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
This is something that Alex

1327
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,680
Is allowing

1328
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Person

1329
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
To be someone he has on her

1330
01:22:55,104 --> 01:23:00,480
He's talking about that time that you just described in the last black women

1331
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,504
You know what's going to happen

1332
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,600
Keep watching

1333
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,080
A group of young men and women

1334
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,200
When it come to this

1335
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,584
Jesus

1336
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,176
3 / 6

1337
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,824
That's a catchphrase

1338
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,112
Is yells about driving people out of

1339
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
So

1340
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:30,400
You are literally advocating for murder

1341
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Murder

1342
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:38,592
Uganda's president being like that

1343
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
Yeah but

1344
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
That

1345
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
In his church

1346
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,552
At the pulpit

1347
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,136
Giving these out like sort of elaborate fantasies about

1348
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,208
Creepin and gay people's windows after you followed them home

1349
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,000
It's slitting their throats in the night

1350
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,560
Like that easy

1351
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
But you can't

1352
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,424
I have no words strong enough

1353
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
To talk about

1354
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,616
He should be in prison yet

1355
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
Man

1356
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
I don't know

1357
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,736
I don't I don't know what the line is in terms of like

1358
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,016
Where does hate

1359
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
Speeds reached

1360
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,832
The point where you're yelling fire in a crowded

1361
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,904
Yeah like that sort of thing but I think when you're a preacher

1362
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,184
And you're at a Pulpit

1363
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,720
And you're advocating

1364
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
Armies of people getting together

1365
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,352
To clear the streets of gay people through murder

1366
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,656
I think you're on the wrong side of

1367
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,704
I think you're on the wrong side of free speech

1368
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Fandom

1369
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,800
I don't know that's what makes it sounds like

1370
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,760
The Labyrinth

1371
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
Michael Savage's willing to have him on his show

1372
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,488
They Advocate positions at ARC

1373
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
In far-off

1374
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
From the store.

1375
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:06,656
You know we talked about how Alex Jones says the quiet part loud

1376
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:10,496
Right but he says about a fart flower

1377
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
That is underlying

1378
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Thanks so much

1379
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
The world

1380
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,688
Whether it's a disregard and not caring

1381
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,552
I think God should put

1382
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,112
People vigilante murder on

1383
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
There's not that much difference

1384
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
In terms of functional out

1385
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
And

1386
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,048
I mean babies.

1387
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Like

1388
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
There is one argument to be made about

1389
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
That or not

1390
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:44,032
I suppose the best coralaire I can pick up for that in

1391
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
In terms of

1392
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,104
The power structure we have now is

1393
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,384
Waze with with Trump

1394
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,200
Talking about Jamal khashoggi murder

1395
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
And him just being like

1396
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
Like

1397
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,624
Yeah that's been American foreign policy for the past

1398
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
60 years

1399
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,720
He's the only one who said it

1400
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
You know

1401
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:10,656
I'm sure that

1402
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:14,752
The lot not of not man a lot of people

1403
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
Eat it

1404
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
It's amazing to me

1405
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,080
How

1406
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,360
Many people who

1407
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
Can't read

1408
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
Can convince people who

1409
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
That what they don't read

1410
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,016
It says something that the person

1411
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
Just wanted to

1412
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,648
I don't know I really hard time talking about this

1413
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,184
Because that was so f****** ugly

1414
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,304
I don't like that at all

1415
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
If you don't look at

1416
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
Person that is

1417
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,080
Semen

1418
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
That's who he is

1419
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,920
People might be asking

1420
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:57,248
Uno lecture he's been a guest on Alex Jones Show but how much does

1421
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,784
Involved

1422
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,600
You don't like is this really that related

1423
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,416
And I'd like to play you something else he said

1424
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
I'd no

1425
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,840
What do you like to see in the world

1426
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
The president who recognized

1427
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
Theocracy

1428
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,928
SpongeBob

1429
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,344
We will

1430
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,392
What's going home

1431
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
Jesus

1432
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:04,992
Go back to f****** Jerusalem goddamn moron

1433
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
I'm ready

1434
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,696
Since from the pulpit

1435
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,232
Alex Jones

1436
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
You've got another Soldier

1437
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,816
Annie says I'm ready just like Alex

1438
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,608
And he said

1439
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
Alex

1440
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,240
Hallelujah

1441
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,008
Yep

1442
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
So you should

1443
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
Recognize

1444
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
I think

1445
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Everybody

1446
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,384
At these worlds are

1447
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Deeply connected

1448
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
Just the fact

1449
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
That he

1450
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
Reverend Manning doesn't

1451
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,528
Support

1452
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,112
Doesn't really matter as much as these other things

1453
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,928
They clearly had enough overlap that

1454
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,512
It's it's such a mess

1455
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
That's crazy

1456
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,304
So

1457
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
I don't know

1458
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,864
I mean what

1459
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,144
What is what we got

1460
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,008
We've shown that someone bad is bad

1461
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:03,104
I don't know if it's this really interesting Dynamic that I think is

1462
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,408
So it exists

1463
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Abundantly

1464
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,016
In the right-wing and in the biggest communities

1465
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,320
You have this

1466
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,624
Rising of

1467
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,440
You know like Alex is a really talented brought

1468
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
Castor

1469
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
And then you scratch a little bit

1470
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,024
You see all this oh my God

1471
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,328
White supremacist

1472
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,608
You have really dangerous

1473
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
Leading people down a terrible Road

1474
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,240
The same way you have Reverend

1475
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Really gif

1476
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
Order in many ways

1477
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Ability

1478
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:38,688
Like the speaker

1479
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,248
Speech about something like

1480
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
If you was making a video about lost it

1481
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,832
Stefan molyneux one I watched

1482
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,512
God I love this

1483
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,840
Natural Talent

1484
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,376
And then beneath it is

1485
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,168
An incredibly dangerous

1486
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
Manipulative

1487
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,472
Monster is human

1488
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,520
Who wishes murder upon

1489
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Lgbtq

1490
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,640
The reality is so much

1491
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
I guess that's my

1492
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:19,392
I don't know anyway if you guys want us to do more on Reverend Manning although I don't know

1493
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:25,792
Why you would want us to leave

1494
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,728
Outside of being able to find 100 more instances of him saying goofy nonsense

1495
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,800
A little bit of sour grapes in the sensitive

1496
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:43,968
Like this is a possibility for us to look at

1497
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
You know we got by over

1498
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,672
Mildly

1499
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,464
I mean

1500
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,792
It is it is weird Everybody that we talked about is a f******

1501
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
Monster

1502
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:05,984
I don't know how much the only way we can deal with it I don't know how much fertile territory there is

1503
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Within

1504
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,032
Reprimand

1505
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,336
African history

1506
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,128
Yeah because at least that lie

1507
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,920
The gives an Avenue to go down

1508
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,272
Yeah the more concrete bulshit a person says the more you

1509
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:22,880
Maybe we'll be able to pick up something

1510
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,672
Like that but in terms of like his

1511
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,232
Bigger story it is really just

1512
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,304
For whatever

1513
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
Hate scape

1514
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,656
It is such

1515
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,192
A visceral thing for him

1516
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472
That it invades

1517
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,032
Almost every aspect of

1518
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,824
It's over for us to like

1519
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,104
Brett

1520
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,152
Also has spread that might be something

1521
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,456
We can always dig into bread but

1522
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,784
I guess the bigger the bigger point is if you want us to cover him

1523
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,088
Let us know we might do that

1524
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,880
Also if there's other suggestion

1525
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,672
You have because I

1526
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,952
Against the wall

1527
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
Terms of like

1528
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,256
Who has shows

1529
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,072
We could go over

1530
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
Event

1531
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,936
I'm willing to explore Whole Lotta territory

1532
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
There's there's Lim

1533
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:17,152
I don't want to do too much more

1534
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:23,552
You going to be like

1535
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,112
I appreciate it but like they're more like

1536
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
Hard

1537
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:31,488
Space.

1538
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,048
What's fun about Project Camelot is the lies

1539
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,400
Something like that sure but

1540
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,192
Anyway if you have a suggestion

1541
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,752

Ring website

1544
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,128
I'll try.

1545
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,744
Before

1546
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
Lena Dunham

1547
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,816
Has been a guest on the Chris gethard

1548
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
But she is

1549
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,120
Is not committed

1550
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,704
As far as I know

1551
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,776
Congruence for her to have

1552
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
There's one guy

1553
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,360
Yeah he's

1554
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
The guy who's

1555
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,432
He's a soldier

1556
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,712
Hallelujah

1557
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,248
That guy

1558
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:36,000
