There's like a bunch of coffee drinks and I just got these ones that are people tap dancing

18
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,504
It's because

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
It's clear you can tell Moshe

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
Static picture

21
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136

Oh that is actually pretty cool

25
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,912
They're like a kind of shiny even like they reflect light if you move them around different

26
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:20,032
Looks of the Sun

27
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
I'm cool son

28
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Drinks for you to get some

29
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,296
And start really going for the stamp collecting

30
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm going to get

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
300 stamp

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
By the end of this year I mean look dude one of the things that is definitely true is that I do have a collectors

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
Impulse it true I used to collect

34
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Certainly basketball cards

35
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
A little bit of football card mostly basketball

36
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,544
Marvel cards

37
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
I was a little bit

38
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,920
Too old for that I paid my tab my timing was a tiny bit off

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
The Gathering I would have but my parents found it demonic

40
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
You got right in that attractive to me and

41
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
Inside I wish that I had the wherewithal to like stand up and

42
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
I'm going to have a secret collection with me but I did not

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,728
I had a weird situation I put I went to a magic the Gathering tournament at a

44
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
What's it called the

45
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Masonic

46
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Lodge

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
What am I friends

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
Is that

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
This is exactly what my parents were saying

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,832
It's so that the Masons are involved with magic the Gathering

51
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
I know I did not do well

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
It was only my second time playing but he was very interested and then they took 12 oz of your blood

53
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Exactly

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Losing

55
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,424
I don't think I'll get into

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,008
Leaving Sam's only reason is because there's too many of them

57
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
882 there's 88 been too long they been making them

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
Acceptance Now now is not the time

59
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
Like a long time ago with

60
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Century your gold

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
Urns for a collection of something

62
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Start diving

63
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
4 doubloons

64
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
We should collect

65
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Doubloons

66
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
I can't tell you how it is and I am on that

67
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Do it

68
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,735
Play some buried Sunken Treasures

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Lights

70
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Next vacation

71
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Let's go

72
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Alright

73
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Books

74
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Treasure hunting

75
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,631
I hear that there's a clue on the back of the

76
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Decorations

77
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
You should go check that out

78
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
It's called humankind I think is the name of it

79
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Pretty sure but

80
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Basically civilization

81
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
6

82
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,719
You know it's really really good same but different in your life

83
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,071
Okay I realize that this is almost exactly like Civilization 6

84
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,631
But then while you're playing at your leg

85
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
I don't know if there's any other way to make this type of

86
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Does game though like that's how

87
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
Incredibly valuable civilization is

88
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
The games like sort of like

89
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
City and state simulation

90
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
You start out in the Neolithic age and some of the cool things about it is that you can change your society and evolve over time and said

91
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Just being stuck with like

92
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,047
Joe Empire

93
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
And now you're going to stay like that until the future

94
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
You can grow and change and you can have different kinds of different

95
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Everything's going on it's actually really really in

96
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
I am looking it up and I'm seeing that it's just on

97
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Computer is now so I am

98
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Apologize for that doesn't really fun it's really good I do find that I enjoy those

99
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,927
Those games a little bit more than I thought I did

100
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And coming up

101
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
Simulation games

102
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
It's kind of like

103
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Took

104
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Took a real backseat

105
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
That it's a nice if you've ever played Crusader Kings 2

106
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Or something like that where the

107
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Level up

108
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Complexity is such that it's so

109
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Impossible to like

110
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
Hey just start playing you like you have to read through Reddit for an hour

111
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Just to figure out how to start

112
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
The game you know how do I walk

113
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Exactly

114
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
But this one has like that good mix of

115
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,207
Difficulty and simplicity can find it

116
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279

190
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
I'm sure some people are trying to blame Trump

191
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
For the current situation in Afghanistan

192
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
I would agree that

193
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
That's kind of looking at too small of a picture

194
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
I would say the same as people who like to throw complete blame onto Biden

195
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
I think it's

196
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
With the Limited

197
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Scope

198
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
There's plenty of blame to go around to a whole lot of people but I also kind of believe that assigning appropriate levels of blame isn't

199
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Something That We're capable of doing on this podcast

200
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
So I don't even want to engage it

201
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,991
Alex is in a really tough situation here for his narrative

202
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Just because

203
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,831
The Taking of Kabul is the direct result of the United States

204
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
Withdrawing troops which is something that he's champion

205
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
For a long

206
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Time now

207
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,303
In the lead-up to the 2016 and 2020 elections Alex presented Trump as the peace candidate

208
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
In opposition

209
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Clinton and Biden

210
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
HuHot

211
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Seeking Skippy's conflicts going

212
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Indefinitely

213
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
He was a major selling point for Alex

214
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
The Trump wanted to bring the troops home and for what it's worth

215
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
That's one of the territories where we were

216
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,431
Closest to agreement the positions that Alex

217
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,087
In October 2020 Trump announced that he wanted to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan by Chris

218
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,231
I'm not sure what qualifies to Alex has a gradual withdrawal but considering how long the war dragged on its

219
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
That's not

220
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Super graduate

221
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Right

222
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,959
The Taliban celebrated this announcement mostly because it was in keeping in line with Trump's obligation under the Doha agreement

223
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Which was signed in February 2020

224
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Do you need added States

225
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
And the Taliban

226
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
What are the major points of disagreement was the US quote

227
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,271
Committed to withdraw from Afghanistan military forces of the United States allies and Coalition partners

228
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
Including all non diplomatic civilian Personnel private

229
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Security contractors trainers advisors

230
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
And supporting service Personnel within 14 months

231
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
Following announcement of this agreement

232
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
After his election

233
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
In April 2021

234
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
Biden gave a speech where he laid out his plans as they related

235
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
The Troop withdrawals

236
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
From Afghanistan

237
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
According to the Doha agreement troops

238
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
We're supposed to be out within 14 months or by May 1st

239
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
Biden decided to begin the withdrawal then with a goal of being out by sea

240
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
September 11th

241
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Fun symbolism

242
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
In the past month

243
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
Many of our allies like Germany and Italy have withdrawn their troops

244
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
And as we've withdrawn the Taliban is coming in and taking over the Capitol and every

245
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Thing is

246
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
A real tragedy

247
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
This is a hard thing to wrap your head around from the people who were in Afghanistan right now to the veteran to a wrestling with these

248
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
These developments

249
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Send their own

250
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
Personal relationship

251
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
To the people who

252
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Staggering

253
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
People who are suffering

254
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
I I just

255
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
I don't

256
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
I don't know

257
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
I die. I'm not I'm not capable of

258
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Over having to write

259
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
The position.

260
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,511
I mean I think the only major thing that I can say like with 100%

261
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Certainty is that

262
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
The amount of people

263
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,959
Screaming about George Bush and Cheney and the military contractors in 2001

264
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Is not large

265
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
That is

266
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
The TV fundamental issue from the very f******

267
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Beginning

268
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
And that they're even talking about

269
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Any other government

270
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
It's beyond the first one first

271
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
Who gives a s*** about Biden or Trump or Obama at this point we have to deal with the

272
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Original f****** problem which we never even bother

273
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Yeah I think I think there's something to be said for that

274
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
I think there's something to be said for

275
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
You know the maintenance of the war is your is is also

276
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Something where

277
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
But again we're getting

278
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Getting into finger point

279
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
I just

280
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
I think

281
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
I think that I think that there is an appropriate amount of that

282
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
It can be done

283
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
It's not the most

284
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Pinpoint right now I don't

285
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
What I mean

286
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
I suppose

287
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,207
The most important problem is that we owe

288
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
A country

289
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
Two people yeah we stole it and destroyed it and then we left

290
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
And said here's the mess

291
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
And unfortunately our best

292
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Attempts that week

293
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
We could make

294
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
To pay back or country

295
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Would be

296
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,639
Well I mean it would be making everybody that wanted forever making everybody that wanted

297
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
United States citizen and giving them f****** Utah

298
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
We owe them a country

299
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
Metaphorically giving mute I suppose

300
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Wee-wee-o a lot of

301
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Folks certainly

302
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Citizenship amnesty

303
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
It's too big of a

304
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
It is

305
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
It is

306
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
And

307
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
One of the things that

308
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
I think it's really

309
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,847
Difficult one of things that I can't really understand even as much as I can

310
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
Can read on the subject is

311
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
Is there any point at which it would

312
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
Have been a tragedy at

313
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
This point

314
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
When we withdrew

315
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Would another year

316
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Have made a

317
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
Would six months has made a

318
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Wood

319
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
The extent to which

320
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
There is no really good solution

321
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Right it doesn't end up

322
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
In a messed up place

323
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
I don't know

324
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
I mean it seems like a

325
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Fairly simple tactical problem that

326
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
If you have an Insurgent Force that's willing to fight

327
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
Until every last one of them is dead

328
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,647
Then you can either say that the only way we win is if we kill all of them or we stop

329
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
It's

330
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Kind of the

331
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Central issue there is like

332
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
If you leave

333
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
They're still there and they're going to fight until they all are dead

334
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,263
And it's something that's really weird to in as much as I think they can

335
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
People our age

336
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Certainly

337
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
A little bit

338
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
Teenage I'm a little older than you

339
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Spy like

340
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
This was really the

341
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
First disillusionment

342
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Of my adult life

343
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Yeah was the

344
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,927
The Iraq and Afghanistan Wars

345
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
The aftermath of 9/11

346
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Was something that

347
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Really brought into Focus

348
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Political dis

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Disappointment

350
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
And

351
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Protest

352
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
And

353
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
That kind of

354
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Involvement

355
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
And

356
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
To be now

357
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Pushing 40

358
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
And

359
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Here we are

360
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
It's

361
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
It's disillusion in all over again

362
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
In a certain way

363
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
I can't imagine what other people are going through and I like

364
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
Obviously whatever I'm experiencing is so minimal

365
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Compared to

366
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
The other folks but it's

367
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Yeah it's

368
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Is a very messed up

369
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
No I mean that was immediately following

370
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
911

371
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,055
It was the first time in my life where I saw

372
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Adults

373
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
With that much

374
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Bloodthirst

375
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Open

376
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
Just straight-up New York Times headlines let's

377
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Kmol

378
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
You don't like it

379
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
It's that kind of level of

380
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Jingoistic

381
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Murder

382
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
I've been called for

383
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,255
And I had no idea that adults would act that dumb

384
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
And it's just been

385
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,887
Will put Abreva coronavirus exactly

386
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
Play yeah it was it was just insane

387
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
It was insane to watch

388
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
In real time just to

389
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Some other news

390
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
What's going on in

391
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Taliban

392
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
Ready to declare Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan

393
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
Recognize

394
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Not true

395
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,671
China about recognized the Taliban as the Islamic Emirate

396
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Or anything

397
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,255
How is it is making that up because it's part of what allows him

398
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
To fit everything into his tidy little

399
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Conspiracy

400
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Breyer news reports suggest

401
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
In the China would be willing to normalize their relations

402
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
The Taliban if they were to take Kabul

403
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
But that is not happy

404
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
According to an article in the Associated Press from August 18th

405
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Quote

406
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
If we are going to recognize our government we will have to wait till the government is formed foreign Ministry spokesperson.

407
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
At least John

408
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Said on Wednesday

409
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Quote only after that will we come to the quest

410
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Action of diplomatic record

411
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
So that's not even

412
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Something that they have

413
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
They have.

414
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
I was just making that up

415
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Yeah that I mean to see

416
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
To even say that it's like

417
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Imply that things are done

418
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
Like the situation in Afghanistan is just

419
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
Well they finished it's over nobody's going to be opening up very normalize diplomatic row

420
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
For a while

421
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
Yeah and I didn't like when the Taliban was in charge of the country prior

422
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Did 9/11

423
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:10,463
Very few countries recognized

424
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
The Taliban

425
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Baby concept of it moving

426
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Forward with many countries

427
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
Recognizing and normalizing relations

428
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
It seems

429
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
Fairly unlikely

430
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
I mean it's not like we're you know

431
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
It's not like everybody's trust in America to not change their mind into years or whatever it is you know like

432
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Who is

433
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
What makes you think that

434
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
At new president

435
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
In two years wouldn't try and start another for

436
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
F****** War somewhere you know like it's

437
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
It's ridiculous to think that they would

438
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Uno's

439
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,071
Sub to me I think that this is probably the

440
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
Top of the top news story that's Alex could be covering here on the

441
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Absolutely

442
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
It's not

443
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
Okay let's just plowed right into the big scoring

444
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Honest and it snow

445
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Electric

446
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Civilization by Design

447
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Globalist

448
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
Their post-industrial agenda 2030 plan

449
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
I've been warning of

450
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
In the middle of

451
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
So here's the headline

452
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Infowars.com

453
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,423
DHHS officially designates anti-lock

454
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Protesters at

455
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
You know read the whole article

456
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,871
Case study that I'd like to make I want to make this

457
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Super clear for everybody

458
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
The headline of this story on RT is

459
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Quotes by Administration Warren

460
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Brett from anti-lockdown extremist

461
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
A sympathizers marking 9/11 anniversary

462
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,303
If you read the article when it's reposted on Infowars you see a completely different headline

463
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Quote

464
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Biden DHHS

465
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
Officially designates anti lockdown protesters

466
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
As terrorists

467
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,799
The headline of the Arty article is fairly odd fairly accurate as it relates

468
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
It's the content of the article

469
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
But the Infowars version

470
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
He's not

471
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,479
It only gets worse when you get to the sub-headline it's been added on Infowars

472
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
Quote Biden's attempt to establish soviet-style dictatorship and Now official

473
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
Okay that was quick

474
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
This is absolute next level of violating Turtles

475
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Stochastic

476
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,168
Not only is Alex been found to have not gotten permission to riposte other outlets articles many times

477
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
In the past

478
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,776
Very clear that his website website is transforming other people's work

479
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
This headline does not match the Arty article and whatever credibility that a website viewer might apply to arti

480
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Is being stolen by Infowars and subverted

481
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
For their own purpose

482
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
It gets worse to

483
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,416
Within the body of the article Infowars is inserted multiple tweet

484
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,024
It's one by Paul Joseph Watson which do not appear in the body of the Arty article

485
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
Weird there's no editorial indication that these tweets are not part of the original article

486
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Line on the article is Artie

487
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,312
There's also multiple ads for Alex's dumb pills and embedded video of someone owing

488
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Troyer interviewed by Pitzer

489
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,432
Let's concerning in terms of directly misrepresenting content then

490
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Embedding tweets

491
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,600
Alex nobody's willing to work with us anymore we kind of burned all of our bridges

492
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
I got a plan

493
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Steelix

494
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,328
Take out one contact and a little bit

495
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
Does anyway Have you listened to

496
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Come on

497
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Considering how concerned Alex was about the co-founder of Snopes

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Plagiarizing some articles

499
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
I would suggest he get his own house in order

500
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Cuz this is amazingly on ethical work

501
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
I think it's almost like he saw snow

502
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Oops plagiarize article

503
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Cousin

504
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,552
I could just plagiarize article cuz this is this

505
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
Kind of practices going on for a long time

506
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,184
But I just think that this is an interesting instance of

507
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Is it a very transparent

508
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Transformation of a word

509
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
This article and Artie and Alex is completely changing the headline

510
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
Adding a sub headline

511
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,056
Throwing in some of his own content in the middle of it

512
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Last night

513
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,384
No I wouldn't be happy with that if I were them

514
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
No

515
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
I probably

516
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
Seasons assisted letter atleast

517
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Fair to them

518
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,024
I'm not usually on the side of Defending RT but here we are.

519
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Did you shouldn't have to put up with

520
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Your stuff being

521
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Misrepresented like that

522
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
Do you like somebody just reposting one of our episodes with knowledge fight guys prove that they are socialist

523
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,408
Monsters and then cut it their own ads into the episode

524
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,248
So Alex gets to this what this is all about

525
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
Behind look with all behind this

526
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
The calling lockdown protest

527
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Chester's terrorist

528
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
National strategy for countering domestic

529
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
Terrorism document

530
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,608
Nashville strategy for counter

531
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Policy

532
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,752
I said any narratives of fraud in the recent general election

533
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,176
Impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol

534
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,992
Conditions related to covid-19 pandemic

535
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Conspiracy theories

536
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
Almost certainly

537
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
Want to try to engage in violence so

538
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
So you're that little stutter-step there at the end and what happened was Alex's cold reading this paragraph So he

539
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
We came to an abbreviation dve

540
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
And he didn't know what it meant so he just said someone

541
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,592
If you actually read or understood this document in any depth he would know that that means domestic Violet extreme

542
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
That abbreviation is actually explained on this

543
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,504
The very same page of the document like four sentences prior to Chinese reading

544
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Way further up

545
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
It is

546
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:00,416
Alex is sort of reading this correctly but he's not quite giving it the context that requires to be under

547
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Understood

548
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Here's the larger Passage

549
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
This is from

550
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Quote

551
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Enduring dve motivations pertaining to biases against minority populations in perceived government overreach will Olmos

552
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
Will certainly continue to drive dve radicalization

553
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
And mobilization to violence

554
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:22,176
Newer socio-political development such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election the emboldened impact of the violence

555
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Free to the US Capitol

556
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,016
Conditions related to the covid-19 pandemic

557
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
In conspiracy theories promoting violence

558
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
Will almost certainly spare some dve

559
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Do engaged

560
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
In violence this year

561
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,816
The document lays out today to primary varieties of domestic terrorism that are on their radar

562
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
Are racially motivated an anti-government

563
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Related

564
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
But even with that being said they point out that quote

565
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Other demands

566
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
The terrorists may be motivated to Violence by single-issue ideologies related to abortion animal rights environmental or

567
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Involuntary celibate violent

568
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Extremism

569
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,528
As well as other grievances or a combination of ideological influences

570
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
In some cases individuals may develop their own

571
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Syncratic Justice

572
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Applications for violence

573
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
The Dubai ready categorization

574
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,584
This document doesn't label Trump supporters are any anti lockdown protesters to be terrorists

575
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
It honestly barely even spend any time on them

576
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
It's a broader picture

577
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Sure but

578
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,080
Just can't waste any opportunity portray themselves as a world's biggest target victims

579
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Boring

580
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,456
Yeah especially whenever it is been proven over and over and over again that these types

581
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
What's the things almost always wind up being

582
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
More direct

583
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,088
Acted towards leftist protesters than anything else

584
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
I think this is

585
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Honestly

586
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
From this distance that I could

587
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Get from it is

588
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
About

589
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Bigot viola

590
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
Yeah but there's most noted in this document

591
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,288
I suppose my problem with those documents is always like whenever they're talking about bigot violets they're not in

592
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
Including that most of the DVDs are also the people trying to investigate

593
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Protests

594
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,112
I think I think that if you were somebody who is

595
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Incline towards

596
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Bigot

597
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Bigotry

598
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Related domestic

599
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Violent extremism

600
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
You might hear something like this and think

601
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Southern border is completely wide open

602
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,008
There are people coming across the Bubonic plague cases

603
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,568
Spring all over the United States

604
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
They are

605
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Cross with

606
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Hundreds of

607
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,576
Diseases that are extremely rare

608
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Whiteman in the tropics

609
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
Better now spreading all over the United States

610
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,256
But they're going to tell you that your five-year-old needs to wear a mask

611
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Celtic evil lazy

612
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
Teachers union wanted to swing

613
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
They're filthy

614
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
That's so it's not reminiscing

615
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,896
So does not say derealization

616
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
Who played certainly not like something we've seen

617
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
Never let the genocide before

618
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,160
It's just I've ever quite a bit is equating disease with

619
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
With immigrants

620
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Other population

621
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
And said he doesn't like

622
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Yep and that's disgusting

623
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Also does bubonic plague

624
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
The storyline is got Nautica

625
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Control

626
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,704
Do I wear still on

627
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Apparently there's

628
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
Transmission of Bubonic plague in four states now

629
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Which is not true

630
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
And also

631
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
That's all Alex's

632
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Traced it

633
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
I guess there's an index patient there was

634
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
No it was actually it was actually a Capuchin monkey but then they you know it's Fred from there and Alex would you

635
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
What's your guy who sold the cat

636
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,328
What you don't understand is that I need to sell so many supplements and dump

637
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Is that we have

638
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
The state-of-the-art last where we do research

639
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
And figure out exactly where the plague came from

640
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Steve pieczenik my friend

641
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Of course it is

642
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
He cured it himself

643
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
Too I know that I know the first case of very well

644
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
So great

645
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Sia

646
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Alex's being

647
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Disgusting

648
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
But

649
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
You know he's also

650
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Really prepared

651
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
I'm not complaining

652
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
I spent

653
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Children are gone right now

654
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
So I've been studying

655
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
12 hours a day

656
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
12 hours a day

657
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Working 12 hours a day

658
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,400
I studied about five hours Friday I studied about not 14 hours yesterday

659
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
Saturday and blonde guy drinking our today

660
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Let me let me just calm down

661
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Comeback

662
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Okay I'm sure you are

663
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm sure this is going to happen

664
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,512
Start from the beginning I've done a million hours of studying in the last day

665
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
I said it for 36 hours

666
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,984
In the past 24 don't know if this is a weird quibble for me and maybe I've even used the term in the past

667
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Somehow saying studying

668
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Hits my ear weird

669
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
Studying cuz usually like you study for something

670
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
Get ready for a test

671
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Get out

672
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
I don't know why studying

673
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
As an exercise doesn't

674
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
It seemed like

675
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
For some reason it doesn't that doesn't feel like the right word but

676
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
I like he's really married

677
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
Researching seems like

678
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
The correct word

679
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,120
Investigate

680
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Eating

681
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Reading wood

682
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
Be very simple and easy to say

683
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Think about the word

684
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,224
Imagine if you prepared really hard and really well and then this is what happened

685
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
Like

686
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,672
I would love to see Alex try and defend his Ph.D

687
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
Oh my God I'm at sincerely

688
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Do you did

689
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
I'll prepare and then you like

690
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Completely f***** up by preparation

691
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
No I just it's just been a habit for my whole life I know everything but I fail every test cuz I pray

692
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
Prepared too much is just failed every test

693
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
You were in that

694
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Sort of position

695
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Is that was what

696
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
Come to you then I can understand why you would learn to never prepare

697
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
I've never read it

698
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,072
Does what he does prepared gets into this headspace

699
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Happy's terrible

700
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
I'm so

701
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
This makes Clippers another

702
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,056
Thing that I wanted to use as I kind of a teachable moment in the same way that looking at that RT headline that Alex is

703
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Completely changed

704
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
An added to the body of the

705
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
The text

706
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,992
This is another piece of rhetorical technique that Alex uses

707
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,576
But if you can recognize some stuff like this it is very helpful

708
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
In terms of penetrating

709
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
His b*******

710
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
The Taliban are caveman

711
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,512
And they are terrible people

712
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Something actually

713
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
It is kind of cool

714
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,496
Dungeons are all over

715
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,600
Adenoma sexuality's about 90% in Afghanistan

716
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
50%

717
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,560
Grooming gangs in England what the f*** are you talking about

718
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Kebab machine

719
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
Conrad's

720
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,136
Indicative of his style and it's a perfect encapsulation of Lights

721
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
Kind of impossible to even

722
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
Think about talking to him

723
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
Clippers a minute-long it is probably

724
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
I'm going to give you an incomplete list of the different claims Alex would mean to substantiate before I would allow him to say

725
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Play another setting okay here we go

726
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
1

727
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
The Democratic party said an internal memo that it's

728
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,408
Kind of cool that the Taliban keep children a sex away

729
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,712
I'm going to need to know who these

730
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
But who is this

731
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Democratic party and Democratic party. Com

732
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
Okay

733
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,768
Go to 90% of Afghanistan are homosexual

734
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
I don't even know if I can fake a reason for that what that is definitely not true and I can find no indication of where Alex might be pulling

735
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,496
This picture from

736
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,616
Patricia Grossman the associate Asia director for Human Rights Watch told the telegraph quote

737
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
Same-sex relations are punishable by 5

738
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,504
Go to 15 years in prison under a law that bans all sex

739
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Between individuals not married to each other

740
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Afghan law specifies that marriage is between a man and a

741
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
Yeah I was going to say

742
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
What world would you get that

743
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,584
Anonymous

744
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
Three fifty percent of the population of the Middle East is homosexual

745
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Come back to self to save his life

746
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
For some contacts in the United States a recent Gallup poll showed that we were at a record of 5.6 +

747
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,272
Set of the population who self-identify as lesbian gay bisexual or trans

748
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,344
The proportion of the population of the Middle East that Alex

749
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
Display my Robin cycle is absurd

750
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
Butthole children and meat kabobs talk about a little bit

751
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Once yourself ever

752
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,168
We covered that overpass episode and Alex came back up that story at all

753
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,800
I just do the case of Charlene Downes who was a girl who went missing in 2003 in the UK

754
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,688
Two men who ran Fast Food Spot were tried for the murder and in the trial the prosecutors allege that the minute.

755
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
Discuss dropping upper body and putting it into the

756
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
The kabob

757
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,344
This was never proven and the main were ultimately not charged and released

758
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
The prosecution was working off covert surveillance that was quote

759
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
Handled poorly and unprofessional

760
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,072
To the point where the detective who was in charge of the case had to resign

761
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,656
After being found guilty of misconduct on a disciplinary hearing was called

762
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,704
To review the how things left

763
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Look at what

764
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Shenzhen country that hold

765
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,408
I wouldn't let Alex proceed until he accepted that this was a story that he couldn't prove it all

766
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
Sandy's just yelling detail points

767
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Yeah

768
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:10,368
5:30 takes live babies and keeps them alive so we can scout them and put their hair and brains on crack

769
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
That would seem to come out of left field

770
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
That's just

771
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,608
Stuff that's dumbest representations of the new Center for Medical progress that came out

772
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,168
Substantiate any bastard yelling about it

773
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
Scalping is self esteem

774
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,616
They're training people and beagles up and putting maggots in their heads to eat their prey seems overly

775
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Complicated

776
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,736
I actually have no idea what Alex is talking about

777
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
This is such a wide swath of points about completely unrelated topics I would take a really long time to actually discuss

778
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
And when you took the time to do so it will become super clear that the version of these stories that Alex's presenting is not real

779
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
When you shoot them off like a Gatling gun what he's trying to do is create too many points

780
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Trulicity

781
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Even consciously take in

782
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Let alone routine

783
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Flood the market with v

784
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,616
This is a tactic to demagogues in bulshit artist use pretty regularly

785
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,432
It's kind of a self-defense mechanism because

786
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
On the one hand it makes them appear to know a lot of stuff

787
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:14,368
And it also makes it so the most critical people probably wouldn't want to engage with them

788
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,720
If you're trying to debate a point with Alex and he responded with a word salad like that

789
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,608
Who be really difficult to know what point you're supposed to respond to which is intentional on Alex's fart

790
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,704
Nonpoint on the road stand up to scrutiny but if you string enough of them together

791
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
You might be able to Bluff it

792
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
And make people just

793
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Too disoriented

794
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,128
Two to argue with you

795
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
This it's a dishonest

796
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
A manipulative debate tax

797
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Yeah it's

798
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
It's black throwing

799
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Sand in Europe

800
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
He's just being

801
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Now debate

802
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Like in blood

803
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Sport

804
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:52,000
This is the Jean-Claude Van Damme of

805
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Propaganda

806
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
See ya

807
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Alex gets

808
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Two talking about

809
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
The covid-19

810
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Queens

811
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Why there's the plague

812
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
It's a good point

813
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Why are we talking about a made-up leg whenever the real Bubonic plague is in four states now Dan

814
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
Yeah I would think that should be a bigger issue if Alex

815
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Believed his own b*******

816
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
You should be leading every show with

817
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Remember what happened last time

818
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:33,216
Show me people to wear a mask

819
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Oh

820
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,616
Your narratives are working at cross-purposes

821
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,432
So Alex starts talking about operation lockstep

822
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
And this just isn't

823
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Let me explain the Playbook

824
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
Permanent world government

825
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
Rockefeller Foundation cooked up landfill operation lockstep

826
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Listen to mop song

827
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,608
Loosen up sign

828
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,936
Three successive approximation of the world ID card

829
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Mobile carbon tax system

830
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Your phone

831
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,616
For gene therapy on a monthly basis

832
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,432
System wants to put into you

833
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
No more FDA process

834
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,600
No more nothing just Absolute Total tyranny what's fascinating to me about that is like

835
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
That none of that stuff Steven

836
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Ian

837
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976
Document that Alex calls operation lockstep

838
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
It's pretty remarkable like the the the distance

839
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
From primary sources that he's gotten

840
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
And how much of this really just

841
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Is

842
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:42,336
Based on him repeating the stuff over and over again and building up the narrative

843
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,176
Snowball goes downhill at Thrifty grabs twigs

844
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
All the sudden your

845
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:54,112
Tiny little kernel of truth from a headline is now a snowball of b******* about

846
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Fauci scalping

847
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Babies

848
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
Where did this virus come from

849
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
Make sure Alex underneath baby's head

850
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,400
Will be serious

851
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Mysterious

852
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
If you're out haha virus

853
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,616
Wuhan Institute of virology

854
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
Fauci

855
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
And Obama in North Carolina

856
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
Because

857
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
You keep it in the United States

858
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
A long-standing

859
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
Narrative the main one

860
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,304
It's about to accidentally change

861
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,912
20 hours of unwholly

862
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
In December

863
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
2019

864
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
And we put out a

865
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
Emergency everyone's waking up to us

866
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,136
We're just giving backseat Montebello Melinda Gates Foundation

867
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Forgetting wobbly

868
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,864
We've got to do something and I sat on her one but that document came out those videos came out

869
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
We learn about until January 2020

870
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
I said this

871
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Covid-19

872
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Out of England

873
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
That's really rabbits out of England to the US

874
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,872
Give me the Chinese

875
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
Bio weapon cook

876
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,928
Monday I don't know I must have missed that

877
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
Sun never set on the British

878
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,680
I think Alex just accidentally said the co it came out of England decided to run with it cuz there's

879
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,776
Just missed it and then I suppose you could say it was developed

880
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:54,175
Down something says that's the big bio-weapon lab that he has in the UK

881
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Alex didn't watch 20 hours of this un

882
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
World Health Organization conference

883
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,695
We covered it back when he first discovered this stuff but just for a little refresher he's talking to at the global vaccine safety some if it took

884
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
2019

885
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,815
Alex didn't watch all of this nor does he understand the issues they discuss

886
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,911
You just saw couple Clips The anti-vax Lunatic Del bigtree posted

887
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
Herman Alex wrote his own story to flush out the rest

888
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
The details

889
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Whatever this narrative comes up at

890
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
It's just a matter of me waiting

891
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,127
To hear him say the word wobbly

892
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,455
But we only hinge word he has to remember this tortillas

893
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
He always says wobbly

894
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
The only way

895
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Jog is memory

896
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,159
That word is actually used in speech by dr. Heidi Larson

897
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
The director of the vaccine company

898
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Project

899
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,815
Dr. Larson Davis Beach on the second day of the conference at the Biltmore complex in the way Alex

900
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Presented

901
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,423
She does say that there are doctors who were expressing less confidence in vaccine that I visit

902
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Is the problem

903
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
But she's not saying that those doctors are right

904
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
Reports on this conference like

905
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,175
The World Health Organization getting together to sound the alarm but doctors around the world they're catching on to the scheme and that's what

906
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,527
What's making them wobbly now it's more like doctors are losing

907
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Yeah and people

908
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Have

909
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
New methods of

910
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
Communicating misinformation or a complete information

911
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
In reality dr. Larson

912
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,327
Speech was about her trust-building is an essential step move move

913
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Forward in society

914
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Here's a clip of her from her speech that you're never going to hear on Infowars that I think it actually pretty well captures

915
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
There's a lot of her point

916
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
One of our biggest challenges

917
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
I think now

918
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,431
Is getting rid of the term anti-vax

919
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,735
Getting rid of the Hostile line

920
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Language

921
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
And starting to have more conversations

922
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
To be open to question

923
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
To make people

924
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Feel like

925
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
They shouldn't be judged

926
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
When they're asked

927
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Crazy as those questions might see

928
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Same to you

929
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,655
As stupid as they might seem or as ignorant as they might seem

930
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
This is an interesting perspective that she's bringing

931
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Oh wait

932
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:01,151
To proactively build trust sure which is trying to diss a big you ate the people who are

933
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,735
Driving the propaganda from the people who are effect

934
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:10,623
Yes people who have like sincere and legitimate concerns and questions they feel are being answered right

935
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,695
And people who are willfully misleading people

936
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:18,815
Cuz if you can separate those two groups you can make a lot of progress in terms of building Trust

937
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
With the people who have questions

938
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
That maybe

939
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
You would

940
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,263
Instinctually or as a knee-jerk reaction be like your auntie Vex weirdo

941
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,567
And respond with hostility or derision

942
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,615
Maybe that isn't the right approach

943
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,919
What you saying

944
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
Makes a lot of sense especially from the person

945
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,807
Yeah the position that she isn't sure no of course

946
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,391
And you know it the same time you can definitely see you.

947
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Doctor is having like his 30th

948
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,999
If parents come in the same day been like

949
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,071
I don't know if I should get my kid vaccinated and he's like

950
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:57,471
F****** stop reading the internet and then turns into an a****** like I'm going to be exhausting day

951
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
Apple clips from this summer they were put up by people motivated by a very

952
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,455
Specific political agenda

953
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
The big version of that summer that he's established on the

954
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
The show is now like

955
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,391
It has been for a bit but it's the explanation for why the globalist needed to do covid

956
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Story but it's just

957
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Not real

958
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
Vaccine is premeditated murder

959
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Sure

960
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Of course you are

961
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
This is just

962
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
How old

963
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
Premeditated psychotic murderer

964
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,615
They're going to stay this winter with all the

965
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
Imagine this winter going to be sedated

966
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,991
Martial law

967
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
God

968
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,415
Supposed to do it on last Wednesday I thought it was already done

969
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,511
A man again

970
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,119
Again if you're listening to this show you got to have that feeling a lot

971
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,727
It's kind of amazing that you can just keep stringing me along like that

972
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,287
Oh going on fifteen years

973
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
Another another explosion, Nayana Kill Everybody

974
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Next week

975
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,783
Okay well I'll see you in a couple weeks you want me to pencil you in for next year too

976
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,879
Your reserve a spot for biting to kill everybody

977
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
That's going to happen

978
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
Camping

979
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,999
So Gaston the show now this

980
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,143
Classic name

981
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
He's

982
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,775
Comedian from the Catskills

983
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
But he's from Aurora Illinois

984
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,431
They make good people in Aurora

985
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Kinda fella

986
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
I don't know

987
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
It's a hundred percent

988
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Vaccine

989
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,743
So why globally was this done

990
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Warfare

991
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,351
I want to hear from somebody

992
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,679
Specifically who's got a political parties

993
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Having some success

994
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
PPL Electric

995
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
In Israel

996
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
For medical

997
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Freedom

998
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
He always comes first with the medical

999
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
4 minutes left with

1000
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Gordon

1001
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,671
So yeah like I said this guy is Israel

1002
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
Just outside Chicago

1003
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,255
He is not politically relevant in Israel

1004
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Regardless

1005
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,095
Alex is trying to put on that

1006
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,191
Unlike major political party but this is

1007
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Really true

1008
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,079
In 2018 he put up a page on a crowdfunding website to run for the open

1009
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Primary three

1010
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
The Slate of candidates for a party running

1011
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
Prepositions

1012
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,759
Ultimately raised $162

1013
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:55,391
It's from four backers one of whom was Anonymous another of shared his last name

1014
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Wow I would hope so

1015
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,743
In the crowdfunding page he discusses how he's a member

1016
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
Of the zahoot party which is a

1017
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,351
Very hard right political party in Israel

1018
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
Sure they're super into expanding settlements

1019
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,847
Location to show up on Rogan sometime soon

1020
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,431
0 seats in 20.

1021
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,247
I don't know if I would rank him as one of the main political parties

1022
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,599
He's willing to talk to Alex so that means he's got to be Prestige prestigious

1023
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,183
Any moment now they're going to get all the way up

1024
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,279
Between one and two seats in the knesset

1025
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,119
Is against vaccines and is against vaccines

1026
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Passport

1027
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,983
Alright plane crash proof of vaccination requirements Uranus that's Tuff

1028
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,567
He also seems to be pretty against the Reform Judaism

1029
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,223
It's a weird conversation and I'm not interested in one of those weird libertarian internet people

1030
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
Do just like have a hodgepodge of things that they're against it for no reason to be honest Alex seems a little bit

1031
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,463
Thrown by that kind of

1032
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
And also

1033
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
I think Alex is is is

1034
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
Going to have some

1035
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Some trouble with Nick Fuentes

1036
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
And I always got this

1037
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
This hard right

1038
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:18,335
Israeli guy who believes

1039
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
And what have you I know that

1040
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Nick Castle

1041
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Thoughts about Israel

1042
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,015
So I don't really care too much about this interview

1043
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,063
But another Gaston

1044
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,879
Canadian weirdo Chris sky

1045
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,743
I've got you wanted to start his own School remember Chris guy

1046
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279

1047
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
Favorite guy

1048
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,679
Latest information on

He's the most successful the most prominent most actor

1051
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,247
I'm sure he wants to be a clipped by you

1052
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
It's about survival humans moving forward

1053
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Exposing medical tyranny

1054
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
5th generation Warfare of depopulation

1055
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,743
That is moving against it because all these cops are saying

1056
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
This is going to be a depopulation weapon

1057
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
And now it's happening and now

1058
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,679
They lied last year in the hospitals were totally empty

1059
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,263
The virus itself was just a game of function thing they own now

1060
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Now what's in the vaccine crane the prions

1061
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,247
It's what's causing massive illnesses all over the place

1062
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,599
And when you go in they don't tell you you need Ivermectin any vitamin c u need zinc

1063
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
Chris Kyle

1064
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Absolution

1065
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
Italian Hospital

1066
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,327
And they just wait until you get worse

1067
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
And then they play

1068
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,703
Then later on you until you again

1069
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
$3,000 for

1070
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Wow

1071
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
Hospitals are murdering you for money

1072
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,991
Yeah I would say congratulations Chris guy on being Alex one of Alex

1073
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:06,367
Unfortunately that does not have a lot of longevity

1074
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,415
And doesn't it

1075
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,743
No typically you end up forgotten

1076
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,791
Or maybe

1077
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Disgrace

1078
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Definitely that one

1079
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
I think that it is going to be fun

1080
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
Time to get together a support group

1081
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,335
It might be a good idea might be a good idea they have a lot to talk about

1082
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Similar stories

1083
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,919
It would be a mentor

1084
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,807
I don't care about Chris

1085
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Skype

1086
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,623
But also this interview is kind of Interest

1087
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:42,975
Elements to it

1088
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Chris guy's phone

1089
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,583
Keeps going out

1090
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,215
He just had a large rally antimatter

1091
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,519
Type of rally

1092
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,871
Can you point out we don't need leaders we have to be the leader but you imagine

1093
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,247
Governor of Texas the governor of Arizona a governor of Florida

1094
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Glad

1095
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
So I think

1096
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,207
Is the governor of Texas Greg Abbott is a little bit busy

1097
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Right now

1098
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,255
Covid

1099
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:23,935
I think you should leave that rally and breathe on everybody who shows I think he might be might be in bed

1100
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
Wooden things that I

1101
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Enjoy bike

1102
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
He's high-minded

1103
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
I'll bet his auntie UMass can T-Rex nonsense

1104
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
He's also incredibly Petty

1105
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,463
He seems to be airing like personal grievances on Alex's show

1106
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,511
Like there's one guy he just does not like

1107
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
In Canadian politics

1108
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
8 planes by kamelot

1109
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
Oh and also apparently there was a booking

1110
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Website

1111
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,959
I got to call out somebody right now real quick

1112
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
The international covid Summit

1113
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
Taking place in Italy

1114
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
I was invited there

1115
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
Invited their months ago they may be promoted

1116
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,223
Two weeks ago they made me register for the event as a speaker I have all the evidence of this

1117
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,295
Make me go on a zoom chat and they told me that I was going to be there

1118
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
15 minutes

1119
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
And I was going to be getting an award

1120
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
They told me to start booking my

1121
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,535
Supposed to be there on the 13th

1122
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Can I get a call

1123
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
It started getting

1124
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Pressure from somebody as soon as they

1125
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
They call me back and they said

1126
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
You're not allowed to talk about

1127
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Vaccine

1128
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
I said

1129
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,103
The wholesome it's about alternative treatment

1130
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
They said that's great

1131
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,343
And they call me back about an hour later we go have another chat

1132
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,367
Okay

1133
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
Bayside Walk

1134
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,439
Say anything about the vaccine

1135
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
You're also not allowed to discuss

1136
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Any form of God

1137
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Government civil disobedience

1138
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
Is all tabs if you take money

1139
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
And you did agree to promoted you

1140
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
Yeah it definitely would

1141
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
Yeah so I guess you failed that test

1142
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,367
The funny part about this is that the international covid Summit

1143
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,695
It's supposed to take place between September 12th and 14th and Rome

1144
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
GoFundMe page

1145
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Oh how's it going

1146
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,167
$2,000 about out of there 50000 gold rays

1147
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
A comedy though

1148
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
It's not what's funny

1149
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
What's funny is that the URL

1150
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
For their GoFundMe

1151
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,639
Is gofundme.com help and censorship

1152
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
Here's Chris guy telling me that he was

1153
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,759
Rudely censored by the

1154
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,599
Kid I talked about the resistance to the government or vaccines

1155
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:54,719
What gives man I thought these people they hate censorship but I mean they are

1156
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
I've been used

1157
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,095
I checked out their website looks dicey as hell

1158
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:04,959
Yeah one real big red flag is it there's no list of speakers on website

1159
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,543
But it's in Rome so if my boy Leo isn't there I'm going to be.

1160
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
A big missed opportunity

1161
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,223
Officer Chris guide said in that to that clip there

1162
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
He has a cat

1163
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Praise

1164
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
It's United

1165
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
I thought it was boom shakalaka

1166
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Booyah

1167
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
You know you know what

1168
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
What you want

1169
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
What's people to do

1170
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,095
What's that unitedly non-compliant

1171
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Which means

1172
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Form a union

1173
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
More or less

1174
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
He's calling for a general strike

1175
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
All you got to do is

1176
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Very simple

1177
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Yeah go on strike

1178
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
If your Apple

1179
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,871
Stop it's our doctor lawyer

1180
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
Frontline worker

1181
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
Teacher

1182
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Student

1183
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,479
Xcetera

1184
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
The work you don't show up to school

1185
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Simple

1186
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
General strike

1187
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,583
General strike not for this reason I'm fine with it we'll figure it out afterwards we'll figure out why

1188
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
After everybody is just struck

1189
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,727
We do for their first things first

1190
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
General strike

1191
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
The opposition

1192
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,847
Withholding labor

1193
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
2

1194
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Advance

1195
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
A cause that these people have

1196
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
It goes completely out the window whenever it's a minor inconvenience

1197
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Slightly sometimes indoors

1198
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:32,767
So all of the posturing I've done and organized people

1199
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:39,167
And how strikes are evil and how they're stealing money from people I'm going to abandon that I'm going to say it's time for

1200
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
For a general strike Forever by

1201
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
So Chris has an event coming up

1202
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
Of course he does

1203
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
He wants to promote this

1204
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,919
Seems a little bit

1205
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
Craven

1206
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Turn on the 20th

1207
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247

1208
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Private event

1209

And wants to see this

1214
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,815
Is finally ready to get off their ass get off the sidelines

1215
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583

Give me my lunch hour

This is a test to see if you would do it for money and the answer is yes of course you would

1228
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
So Christmas

1229
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,287
Phone difficulties and what-have-yous Alex

1230
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
Length of a little bit

1231
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Are you gets to

1232
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
Talking about some weird s***

1233
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,967
This is where things broke

1234
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
Broke real strength

1235
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
What percent of Saudi Arabia

1236
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
The Chinese

1237
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
This was for Canada

1238
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
This was for the UK

1239
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
This was for Australia New Zealand for America

1240
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Anglo-Saxon ethos

1241
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
Wow

1242
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,543
All white people

1243
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,151
Don't do this

1244
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,479
Yes it is talked about

1245
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,319
Getting rid of Magna Carta getting rid of the Bill of Rights getting rid of the Constitution

1246
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
Idea

1247
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Wow Roundtable

1248
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
14

1249
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,559
Amazon at the head of the table

1250
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,887
I can't believe I've had to save us so many times on this show

1251
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
But King Arthur wasn't real

1252
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
I'm Blown Away by

1253
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,127
By using King Arthur to justify white supremacy

1254
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
When's the new one

1255
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,223
I like even his qualifier that it's like

1256
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
Not all white people are

1257
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:08,415
Supreme

1258
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Green people are white

1259
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,975
I don't get why you think this is racist

1260
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
So leaving aside the King Arthur

1261
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,655
Alex at the 20% of Saudi Arabians are vaccinated but that number is actually 47

1262
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
1.6 %

1263
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
And according to Reuters

1264
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:25,823
Alex said the 10% to is in India and I figure is actually 20.4%

1265
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,895
Time is it about 67.5%

1266
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:35,551
This districts that are available or not of total people vaccinated but the number of doses administered and then you just assume that people get

1267
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Two doses

1268
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,647
So factoring in the windows vaccines these numbers could actually be

1269
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Be higher

1270
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:45,279
At the same time there's some people who get one dose but not the second dose which like a Pfizer in moderna so

1271
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:51,935
That could shift the number a little bit here but the point is that Alex is just making up numbers and using them to justify his bizarre wife

1272
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
White supremacy

1273
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
That's that's

1274
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
That's just real fun

1275
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
Target

1276
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
Places that are descent

1277
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
Of descendants

1278
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
Right

1279
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
Yeah

1280
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,831
And as we all know from Reading history

1281
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
Prior to King Arthur

1282
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:17,535
No leader had ever listened to the people that he was leading before

1283
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Never

1284
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,351
Never had they thought they were

1285
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,751
Equals there zero civilizations that have grown up in places outside of white places that have

1286
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
Created democracies and republics

1287
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Publix in the lake

1288
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
But also things

1289
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,967
Didn't end up working out so great for that Roundtable

1290
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
Fine I guess you still lost

1291
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
His wife

1292
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,599
Geiger kill them

1293
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
Look King Arthur

1294
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Dot-dot-dot

1295
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Great

1296
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
X Also let's not forget

1297
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,767
King Arthur

1298
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Technically still on his way back

1299
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,631
Caswell is King Arthur's coming back

1300
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
Okay

1301
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
Warren LifeLock

1302
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,007
The thing is

1303
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
In history we have

1304
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Going to way back

1305
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
King Arthur Round Table

1306
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
America

1307
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
Straight line

1308
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,319
And if you are somebody who's like

1309
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
I don't know

1310
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
Not white

1311
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
Right in America you should feel bad

1312
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
You should feel lucky

1313
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,279
What is Western Society

1314
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Give me black

1315
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
But because you live

1316
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,703
Syrian

1317
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
Rothchilds another

1318
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,431
Evil took over King Arthur

1319
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Syrian spirit

1320
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
Create

1321
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
For a few

1322
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
They are seeking to overthrow it

1323
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
And kill it

1324
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
The world's not being targeted

1325
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Okay

1326
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
So

1327
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Alright

1328
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,143
This is an interesting wrinkle 222 Alex's

1329
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
Historical

1330
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
Lure

1331
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Yeah

1332
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
I mean

1333
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
I guess he's a monarcas

1334
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
So that's

1335
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,199
Do you like the presentation I guess of a benevolent monarch

1336
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
What's a monarch

1337
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
Pretending to listen

1338
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,879
Yeah that sounds like what people who believe in God would want right

1339
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,951
I guess basically the same thing that they think God is

1340
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
It's just a guy who's

1341
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,023
It's like really nice and run say

1342
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
So I guess

1343
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
Pictures of reward

1344
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Jean Arthur

1345
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Is

1346
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
Almost did

1347
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
Deified

1348
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Figure

1349
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,335
Well yeah I mean he is coming back in the Arthurian Legend

1350
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,383
He does resurrect later on

1351
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,199
I mean c.s. Lewis YouTube

1352
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,503
I think it was this present Darkness

1353
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
Is there something like that it is out of

1354
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
The Silent Planet

1355
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
King Arthur comes back to life

1356
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,183
Modern-day England or whatever

1357
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
King Arthur's coming back

1358
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,071
Man I don't know I struggle to fit

1359
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
The pieces together of this jigsaw puzzle

1360
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
Just it's a mess

1361
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,215
So King Arthur

1362
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
Round Table

1363
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Knights

1364
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Equals

1365
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
White people are superior

1366
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,247
Alex must have really hated Monty Python really struggling for him

1367
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
Okay so

1368
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Chris guy come

1369
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
Comes back

1370
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
Any Elena

1371
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:29,535
Comply with this vaccine stuff

1372
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,583
You're all going to die ever this

1373
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
But if you don't

1374
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Utopias

1375
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
Comply

1376
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
We could have

1377
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,751
A golden or what they're going to call

1378
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,775
Crystal age

1379
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Society

1380
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
1Weather

1381
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
People have

1382
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
Total control over their lives

1383
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,735
One where we have a much higher standard of living with a much lower cost.

1384
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Fabletics

1385
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
Much less centralized

1386
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Control

1387
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
Control of resources from

1388
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
A few people

1389
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
This is what

1390
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
They don't want

1391
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
Because they lose their wealth they lose their

1392
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
We will

1393
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
We'll all get

1394
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Good life

1395
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
They've been enjoying

1396
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
So how do we do this

1397
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Call United.

1398
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
Compliant

1399
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Simple

1400
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
United

1401
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,983
I don't comply

1402
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:18,431
Chris guy is on fire as usual we're going to reconnect with him having turn off the stuff on that laptop

1403
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,967
His phone went out again

1404
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,599
Yeah I mean like this is a little bit pie-in-the-sky ish

1405
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
It seems like

1406
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Very nice

1407
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Specific

1408
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,791
We're going to enter a wonderful age where everyone will have everything they want

1409
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,351
A chicken will be in every pot

1410
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
Yeah

1411
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
And also

1412
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
There's not a world of difference between this

1413
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
And

1414
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,847
So she know it's exactly that

1415
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:50,431
No it's kind of it's kind of funny that he's described

1416
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
Accurately the problems

1417
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,551
A potential solution

1418
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
And the way forward and yet

1419
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
At the same time

1420
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,487
The people he works for are the ones who are continuing the

1421
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Status quo that he is

1422
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,351
Yeah there's a there's a desire

1423
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
For people who have

1424
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Has been

1425
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
Left out

1426
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,519
Control their own destiny to a greater extent

1427
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,639
Democratize the workplace maybe income inequality is out of control

1428
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Yeah.

1429
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,711
General strike is a good idea

1430
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,831
I think so but I don't want to do his he don't want to do his either

1431
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
That's the amazing thing that they

1432
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
That they manage

1433
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,255
To do like that Fox News and Alex and all of those people

1434
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
Like yeah man we income inequalities out-of-control yeah we don't have control over online

1435
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,727
The government is f***** up and can't

1436
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
How to tell if whatsoever yeah

1437
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,799
I agree with you in a general strike

1438
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
Is a good way to send a message

1439
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
But we're not going to take this s*** anymore

1440
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:57,247
But the people that you are agreeing with are the what do I default to the problem in the beginning

1441
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
The bus

1442
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,879
How did they do that how did they trick you into thinking that by work

1443
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,671
Looking for them you will be working again

1444
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Them

1445
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
It amazing

1446
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
I don't know and I have a headache

1447
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,327
So Alex starts talking about how

1448
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
When you hear smart cities

1449
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
It is I thought it meant like charger

1450
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
Alright

1451
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
And then it leads to an ad

1452
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,895
Development

1453
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,199
Nazis

1454
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,039
I think Beyond Nazis think absolutely being starved

1455
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,063
In control

1456
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
We're going to make it harder and harder by the way

1457
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,279
Stay on air so I need to remember

1458
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
Tell the listeners of this broadcast

1459
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
On this Sunday evening

1460
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:57,407
Without your support

1461
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
Thousand percent a trillion percent

1462
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Infinity committed

1463
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,087
What if I don't remember my t-shirts and buy bulk sand

1464
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
My films

1465
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
We won't be on the ear

1466
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
We're more important than ever

1467
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,303
I'm not trying to brag my phone

1468
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Sure

1469
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
Leaders of God

1470
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,959
All the major talk show

1471
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,103
Probably call me up

1472
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
Real blessing to me

1473
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,343
And I'm looking for other people to be in that position as well.

1474
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
That's how we win

1475
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647

I remember the Mirchi is to be able to get it delfi

1487
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647

1488
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,999
Rideable hey what's going to happen with the rain

1491
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
But first here's a gun part

1492
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
You're going to have to buy where to hide

1493
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,519
A a bucket of food

1494
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Alex comes back

1495
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895

01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,431
They'll be facing millions of us

1505
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
We got bad blood

1506
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
Ready

1507
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Real quick I want to talk

1508
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,159
Talking about the concept of

1509
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:21,535
Facing a million Alex Jones is

1510
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,119
I would rather fight 1000 Alex Jones's than one

1511
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
Because they could never get along

1512
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,703
That's true

1513
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,847
Find a way to hide it like at the top of a

1514
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:41,247
Retrieve you'd be safe this what you do if you got $1,000 Jones's you just be like

1515
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,807
You guys have to fight in a tournament

01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,855
Ed only one of you can fight me

1517
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:50,975

You controlled opposition

1520
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,607
Probably won't even break

1521
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,679
Just started whisper campaign but they were just

1522
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
Big fall like dominoes

1523
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Not coexist

1524
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:10,175
Did you hear that that one married a non-white person was

1525
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,711

Great activist

1529
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,879
Chrissy

1530
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Repeatedly asked

1531
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
He wants to

1532
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,047
Start over

1533
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071

1535
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Chris Kyle

01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
You either comply

1539
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151

1540
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Comply

1541
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
If you comply

1542
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
This cold

1543
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,039
Vaccine vaccine

1544
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,343

People dead

1546
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,159
More laws broken

1547
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
More freedom

1548
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:58,047
Taking this is the exact same thing as I give you comply you die if you don't then we have a Utopia

1549
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,607
Just saying the exact same thing over again

01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631

01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:06,239
They are they are cutting off my phone look outside of gas station man

1552
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055

01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527

1556
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,831
Text you you could have been at home

1557
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:26,207
Hardwire to the internet man what were you doing running errands

01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
The same time might as well just head there now

1561
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
So Alex is a very important question

1562
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
Jennifer Chris and that is what would Jesus do right now

1563
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,215
Oh I thought it was how much

1564
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Can you bench

1565
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,543
He already asked them that interviews back

1566
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,359
Quite a bit

1567
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,759
And then we get our little bit of got to give it up to the Somali pirates, cuz

1568
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
You knew it was coming

1569
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,623
What would Jesus Christ what would Jesus Christ do

1570
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Right now

1571
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,743
I can't say with Jesus Christ will do but I can tell you what I want to do and that's

1572
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,023
Red Lobster

1573
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
Compassion

1574
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
Come from a place of love

1575
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
How can they demonized you how can they pretend pretend what all you're doing is advocating for free

1576
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,055
Choice

1577
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,079
That's assault

1578
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,151
If you

1579
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,455
People in bath

1580
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,759
Edit aggressively hugging them

1581
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,039
Without permission

1582
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
Punch me

1583
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
Or leave

1584
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:35,327
Do not try to hook back of a pretend were violent we are invading their personal space

1585
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Tell them you love them

1586
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,239
Doesn't mean I still believe in the back

1587
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:48,639
That's why they want you to be violent they wanted to look fine. They want us to look crazy

1588
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,175
Violence is not the answer

1589
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,991
How do we start literally they're preparing a false flag

1590
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
You got me

1591
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Take on that

1592
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:02,719
You just have to have the numbers we have what kind of violence can I use against 300,000 people to line up the army

1593
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
Everybody down

1594
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:10,911
You think the Army was going to do that the Army would turn their guns on the government before they turned

1595
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:17,055
They're horrible people but there we go

1596
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,639
The whole biggest military in the world can't stop

1597
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,223
How can I make

1598
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Germany

1599
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
In France

1600
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
And Israel

1601
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,623
And the UK and Canada the US and Australia New Zealand

1602
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,159
Martial law

1603
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
When it's a fake vaccine is poison

1604
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,231
Stopped

1605
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,839
L an arrest

1606
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,383
That's all we got to do some close to me

1607
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,919
If somebody is wearing a mask

1608
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Give him a hug and then

1609
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,855
Take them with you to the Hague to watch fauci be hung

1610
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:05,695
Also buried in there is the you got to give it up to the Taliban

1611
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
To the Taliban hey come on

1612
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,351
If you're if you defeat the United States military you got to give it up to

1613
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
The Taliban

1614
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,911
So is that nice moment of

1615
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,447
Look I'm not defending the Taliban

1616
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
But Hey listen

1617
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:24,383
I hate the Taliban and I think we should stop him however I do agree with all of their governmental choices they're banning a boy

1618
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,711
Similar to what I want

1619
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,527
Yeah that moment of realization that struck some people

1620
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,575
So Alex end of the Show screaming

1621
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:36,927
And then there's a juxtaposition of the actor that plays right after the show

1622
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,719
I want you to make down for this cuz

1623
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
FedEx

1624
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767

1625
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607

01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
I'd like to look at

1643
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
Into this a little bit alright

1644
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:51,935
Their website claims that quote this Sleek wearable air purifier repels particles such as

1645
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
Bacteria viruses molds

1646
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,543
Spore allergens and other pathogens from your breathing space

01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
For a personal 4ft

1648
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,383
Queen Arizona

1649
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Is that

1650
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:07,551
Works it seems like everyone should have one of those are inefficient from what I understand they don't work as

1651
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
Well is Isaiah you expected

1652
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,903
A lot of ionizers

1653
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,719
Is it that they run the risk

1654
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,767
Of creating ozone

1655
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,303
Which is really dangerous

1656
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,631
This website is all over the place

1657
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,167
The address

1658
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,983
4 at the website is Project pillow-talk

1659
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,359
Gmail

1660
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:37,503
The contact email is info at remember the law of Moses.com

1661
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,879
Okay, remember the law of Moses

1662
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,903
Has he got Usher

1663
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,791
He got checked out that website the place that sells lawn signs and bumper stickers that have the Ten Commandments

1664
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:55,679
Because apparently displaying them will save America I forgot the ten

1665
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
The project pillow-talk

1666
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,823
Is two sections on the website one is for this amulet Shield

1667
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,895
Any other is a section where they sell pillowcases

1668
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,295
They have the Ten Commandments on that score to super weird

1669
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
Of the Lamb

1670
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,855
Jordan

1671
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
Again

1672
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,463
I might have to ask you to make down for this because it's amazing

1673
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:23,327
This is the audio that plays on the website whenever you go to

1674
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,143
Do the pillowcase Auction Sales website

1675
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
A project pillow

1676
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
Let's get right down to business

1677
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
This nation

1678
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,847
America was founded on

1679
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
The ten

1680
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
The one-room schoolhouse is used to

1681
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
The teacher

1682
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
It was the

1683
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Curriculum in every

1684
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,783
School and every house

1685
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
Call the Bible

1686
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
The law

1687
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,159
He says if you love me keep Garden

1688
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Do my commands

1689
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,511
You say you love me you're not keeping a garden

1690
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Doing Michael

1691
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
Does not in urine

1692
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Now that

1693
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Let's go for

1694
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,215
Proverbs 6:23 the

1695
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,263
The Commandments the lamp or the law of God

1696
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
Is the light

1697
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
He commanded us all to be the light

1698
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,383
Now

1699
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,223
If it was the foundation of American every Schoolhouse and ever

1700
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Treehouse

1701
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Perhaps you'll have these

1702
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Face pillow cases

1703
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
Under your heads

1704
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Immediately

1705
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,903
Remember it's in the Bible twice with

1706
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Jacobs

1707
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Pillow

1708
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,487
That's right

1709
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,279
Jacob's pillow and the pillow that

1710
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Slept on

1711
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,583
The middle of

1712
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Now do you think these

1713
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,935
These plagues are going away it's at

1714
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,983
It says in the Bible there's going to be plural

1715
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
Play

1716
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
So we'll talk about the amulet

1717
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
As well

1718
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,359
That's in the Bible twice

1719
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,151
So you're supposed to

1720
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,455
Teach your children when they rise up when I lay down

1721
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,015
Do you know the command

1722
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
That's the problem

1723
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,343
Can you say the right now all

1724
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Ten

1725
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,135
For sure

1726
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,719
Well you don't have to have in order but you better have them

1727
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
Written all the tables up your mind

1728
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
And your heart

1729
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,399
The only way to save America is to win this spiritual war you got a

1730
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
You got to clobber those demons

1731
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,543
You're not going to do it with a gun or freeze-dried food

1732
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Florida underground bunker

1733
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
You cannot

1734
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,175
Walkaway is a coward now

1735
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
You have to be equipped

1736
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,759
The equipment you need is step one

1737
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,319
Project Pillow Talk pillow cases

1738
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Underneath your heads

1739
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:33,375
It goes on from there it's even longer if I do like

1740
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
Pillowcases the rude

1741
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
Bible verses

1742
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:42,591
Echo is in the audio to like it's it's

1743
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
Do another take

1744
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,967
I would have probably there seems to be a couple points where

1745
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,039
Things Fall Apart

1746
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:57,439
Maybe he was going if you want to save America you got to go up to the next

1747
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
When you see and say it

1748
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
Clobberin time

1749
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,095
I'm at him with a pillow

1750
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,935
Pillow fight pillows Direct

1751
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:12,799
Play is this a pillowcase I didn't think there's any connection with my pillow at

1752
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
Itself

1753
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,384
Curious

1754
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
I think that this is working on the assumption that

1755
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:25,856
It's like there's some kind of an osmosis that happens you sleep on East words

1756
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,184
Other work so I'm not entirely sure what's going on here

1757
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
But

1758
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
From what I could tell I

1759
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,840
Think that this is all run by a Christian fanatic

1760
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
Dentist from Louisiana

1761
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,912
Why is it the dentist

1762
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
To wind up

1763
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,264
Getting either work for the CIA

1764
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:51,200
Almost don't really care exactly who's behind this I just think it's a really good snapshot of the sort of folks

1765
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,016
We were willing to pay Alex and gcn4 add time

1766
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,832
Point this is what they're down to

1767
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
You've got

1768
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
Discount rate

1769
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:09,120
The sale of at least four pillowcases to cover the cost of an ad spot that sell a magic aired

1770
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
Necklace

1771
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,216
Zealot pillows

1772
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Alright

1773
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,568
First thing you got to do

1774
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,360
A pillowcase

1775
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
With the Ten Commandments on it

1776
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,432
ASAP

1777
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,992
ASAP otherwise this country's going

1778
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,320
There was another pillow case that they sell that has

1779
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
It says

1780
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,904
Beer scriptures is the name of it

1781
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
But I couldn't

1782
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:37,792
Zoom in on it enough to see what the actual scriptures about what that means but I guess it's

1783
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
Scriptures that make you scared

1784
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
Scriptures

1785
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
The f****** you're going to die

1786
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,984
Yeah I would assume that something like that

1787
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:49,056
Good people to be

1788
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,616
Literally in bed with what I would are they

1789
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:58,016
The Ten Commandments father and mother

1790
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:02,368
Don't take the lord's name in vain commit adultery

1791
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,184
Honor the Sabbath

1792
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Oh yeah

1793
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,512
That's a good one

1794
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,560
Wait why was honor the Sabbath

1795
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Part of

1796
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,864
The founding of the United States

1797
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,704
Did you ever wonder that if America was founded on the Ten Commandments

1798
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,776
It seems like we could have chosen like 6 or so

1799
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
Yeah

1800
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
Anyway

1801
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Get a pillowcase

1802
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
To honor thy father and mother

1803
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,040
So we'll be back

1804
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,112
On Monday and I'll see I think I was probably going

1805
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,904

1806
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
You know he's going to get borin

1807
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488

On this day

1812
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:51,776
I'm waiting for him to say that America is installing the bath party a two-run Afghanistan

1813
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
A matter of time

1814

Oh yeah it's it's

1815
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
It's a little bit strange

1816
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,640
To me that's

1817
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,688
You know you supposed to be a new show

1818
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712

Interested in discussing

1823
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,720
Intimate Expo
