1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have a great respect for this knowledge B knowledge

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

6
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,816
Around a little bit of Alex

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,776
My bright spot today Jordan is of course the dream creamy summer which is a handful of

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Non-Stop

10
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
I've stopped a little bit

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
It's been pretty good I got to say though.

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Everything has been

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
Good ice cream

14
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
But I'm looking for something going to blow my mind or be like this sucks absolutely

15
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,072
You know I think I'm somebody was a bit of a traditionalist sometimes

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
Y'all having some of these non-dairy options

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Okay yeah so bars the Greek yogurt

18
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
I'd like me was a stick-in-the-mud would be like

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
This is not the ice cream I know true

20
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Great Define

21
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
There's a big sister

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
I don't know I I wish that I had something to report is like

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
This is

24
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,464
This is fantastic thing about the Munsters and the Celtics

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
Is that you can really f****** a mustard or a seltzer

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
True

27
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,936
To f****** an ice cream I don't I don't agree with that at all I don't know

28
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,544
Pretty good I don't know I think he could have some real

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
Lavender ice ice cream shoving up yours I don't have a problem with lavender.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Lavender ice cream you can have some flavor problems and maybe if it's lavender for you then

31
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
So be it is

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Yeah I don't know I think you can also just have

33
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Poorly made

34
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Stuff to

35
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
We'll see we'll see what

36
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
But you can

37
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
Find pictures

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,008
Instagram which is kind of

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:56,128
A problem because I have to send you pictures of the ice cream that I'm eating it's even more

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:02,528
No it's even more ridiculous than that because you send them to me because of the way that I have the account setup

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
I don't have it on my phone so that I have to

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,184
Email the pictures to my own email address in order to put it

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
They're always bad there's a lot of steps here that are unnecessary where we not going to change anything about it

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
I am going to start giving you actually like

45
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
A little bit of a synopsis of how I feel about it

46
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,432
Now it just like you covered up with a caption

47
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
The dreamy creamy summer hat

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah we're going to change that whatnot or horrible process

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
What about you

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
My bright spot Dan is for the 1st

51
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
First time in 20 years

52
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
After having been put on my Partners insurance

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
I went to the doctor

54
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
I went to the doctor

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
First time at 20 years old

56
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
That's a little much

57
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,080
I am not the most regular of

58
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Medical attendees

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,832
Yeah good at it I'm not good at merely through the paperwork

60
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,952
A little bit older I think it becomes far more important

61
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
That you

62
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,559
Seems like regular appearances

63
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Doing good doing good twenty years has not hurt me

64
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,239
All of my habits you said we're a perfect to continue

65
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
At the rate that I'm going back at all yeah I feel like everyone smoking again

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Wild wild listens is like great blood pressure

67
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,415
Just mellow the absolutely perfect

68
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,535
120 over 80 over 80

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Stop

70
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Good

71
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
Perfect did you go to Trump's doctor

72
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
I don't mean to cast aspersions okay okay so under an overpass or over in a

73
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Overpass I feel like the doctors qualities

74
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
The same right

75
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
FairPoint

76
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
We are in prison

77
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
Episode

78
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
2022 that's Monday to you

79
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Sure

80
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
I have to be honest with you

81
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
I find it difficult to listen to him of the present-day not because of how awful he is although that is certainly a challenge

82
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
But because I haven't gotten an explanation for why we're not all dead already

83
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Reddit

84
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
Do you know it's too much we can't stop it it's already too late

85
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
I'm still in that headspace what I'm listening to Alex's trivialize bulshit

86
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
I just don't know what's going on anymore

87
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
The problem there is that

88
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
You're still in that headset

89
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Right because you were in that headspace when you were listen

90
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
To that end in the intervening time. You were received

91
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
0 million-dollar

92
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
That is true you're not in the good headspace.

93
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
A couple of million dollars like outside

94
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
I think I will

95
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Would still have question

96
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
I think you would probably with spiral out of control

97
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
Add a couple million dollars hold on

98
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,047
We're all dead already how do we do that

99
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,447
Just pretending that didn't happen I guess that's the way to do it

100
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
So here we are

101
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
Let's go

102
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Thank you very much

103
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
American citizen who led by two Australian guys with Alex considered

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Next

105
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,911
Betsy wants to hear the drop of Alex insisting he knows how to read please it's my birthday thank you so much and I apologize

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
I'm a policy wonk

107
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
No

108
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Fine

109
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
No

110
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
How to read

111
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Thank you so much

112
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
Caitlin sandals

113
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,319
Might be sandal sandal

114
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
Piggy but not the beer things thank you so much you're and I'll probably walk

115
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
A little piggy

116
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
Finally we got to take the credit makes Jordans so thank you so much too

117
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
Workers of the World Unite you are now attacking

118
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
I have

119
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
Risen above

120
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Miami

121
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
A list for me

122
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
And then we're going

123
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
To come back

124
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
And I'm going to

125
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Start the show over

126
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
F*** you

127
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
F*** you

128
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
I got plenty of words for you but

129
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
At the end of the day

130
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
F*** you and your new world order

131
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
She wrote in on

132
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
And all your s***

133
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Maybe today

134
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

135
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

136
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
And you never see me again

137
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Really what I want to do

138
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Apologized

139
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

140
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

141
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
I'll be better tomorrow

142
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
He's not

143
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
ESO trouble

144
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
I think there is one thing that happen

145
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Thomas episode that's a notable

146
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
And it is a protracted

147
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,895
Sort of breakdown that Alex has in the middle of the show

148
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
In anymore contemplatively mood

149
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Movies

150
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Why you think so many movies

151
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Hunting James Bond movies

152
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
And The Kingsmen and just countless others

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Logan's Run

154
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
Tulsa

155
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
There's so many

156
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
12 Monkeys

157
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,687
Talk about global Elite releases virus depopulate

158
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
Operating system

159
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
You got to go along with that idea

160
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
Tell you through the movies but

161
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,815
This isn't a 1960s

162
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Movie Lunardi's with 2000

163
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
This is a real planet

164
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
That we live on

165
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
If you're trying to make a list of these movies did not prove that the globalist to try and use films to announce the public that are planning to

166
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Depopulate the planet

167
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
What's third entry on your list is zardoz

168
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
I don't think that you have a good list here

169
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
I think your point may be hurt by your own list sure now

170
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
You say that but

171
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
I do recall in the Book of Revelations that

172
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,935
The Horseman of War looks an awful lot like Sean Connery in zardoz

173
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,311
Bat bat maybe a interpretations but do say that but

174
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,711
I don't know I heard people talk about it

175
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
Has to do with like a population die off by Elite using a bio-weapon maybe it is I'm not sure I

176
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
More widely used plots and antagonist to movies like serial killers that's a lot that people use all the time

177
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
Alien invasion

178
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
One by one they have an alien invasion

179
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
And zombies

180
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,223
Vampires natural disasters

181
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Natural disasters

182
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
The reason that there are a number of movies that use a villain planning to kill people with some kind of biological weapon is because it's a way to cry

183
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Create really large Stakes

184
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Is that the protagonist has to face

185
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,887
It makes it all the more important that the villain be stopped because the Rippling damage that their success would cause is huge

186
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
Conversely the post bio-weapon dystopia is a good way to create a setting for a story where they could be less people

187
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Around like at unless people

188
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
The environment isn't really changed sometimes it's easier on a budget

189
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
BNB your filming a movie and you've written some script and maybe there's a lot of stuff in there and maybe you're just like

190
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
How about we write in that it

191
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Cheaper than Macon

192
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Like

193
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,047
28 Days Later you have to change the environment at all

194
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Have

195
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Less people

196
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
Zombies running around

197
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
People

198
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
We got a lot of these things that Alex

199
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,103
Thanks are our predictive and what the globalist Urology was going to happen

200
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Tell you what the actual

201
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Plan is

202
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,783
We've already know we know what the plan is we're already dead is the plant

203
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,415
The plan is all God I have no idea

204
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
Actually a good movie

205
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
The real model

206
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
They're going to use for control over a city population is going to be

207
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
New world

208
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Thx-1138

209
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
1984

210
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Morris children

211
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Of men

212
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
We haven't seen

213
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Children

214
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Wait

215
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Chemical in the water supply

216
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Sterilize you

217
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
They hit you in the water to sterilize a large percentage

218
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
Sterilized

219
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Sterilized

220
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Dockside aerosol spraying

221
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Subway

222
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
It wasn't

223
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
Stuff in the water people no idea

224
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Pointedly unexplained

225
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah it was like a we don't know why all of the sudden everybody couldn't have children and then one person could and we're like

226
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
That was the whole thing

227
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
Yeah I don't remember a third it's like if people put

228
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
Stuff in the water to make people.

229
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,063
Especially considering that the people in charge really wanted the person who could have kids

230
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Because

231
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
Super important. Because I knew could contain you should have the whole speech

232
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Yeah it's really important yeah

233
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
Then wasn't in the 3rd of cabals Interest

234
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
So tender the movie

235
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,847
I don't know any weight those pieces of dystopian fiction that Alex listed their they're largely incompatible with each other

236
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
Future similar to Brave New World to come to be essential elements of what makes children of man Edisto

237
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Copiah could not have happened

238
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Example

239
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
They are mutually exclusive

240
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
That's it

241
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
He's kind of a different doomsday fantasy for Alex

242
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,095
He talks about the globalist attacking reproduction sometimes it's just kind of his version of the white nationalist talk

243
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Complaints about declining birth rates

244
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,495
But usually doesn't end up being the end-all-be-all of the globalists plan

245
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
The Doodly just like

246
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Side project

247
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Also

248
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,199
Why would the globalists make it so no one can have kids if their whole thing is abusing children

249
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
I guess they derive their power from hurting kids and drinking their blood so they can

250
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
Satan wouldn't it be

251
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
Self-defeating to create a Children of Men scenario

252
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
I'd love to see how Alex Wood

253
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Explain that clearing plot hole

254
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
I guess they Farm them

255
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
How

256
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
You know

257
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
What

258
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
With the

259
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Do fish farms you put them in nuts

260
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
I think they could do the same thing with babies that's where they come from I consider this this whole thing of

261
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,991
Well maybe you'd have synthetic robot children

262
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Torturing a soul is what

263
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Dara child in

264
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
You just had synthetic children it wouldn't work

265
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
I just don't think it's fair

266
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
For you to f****** Outlaw abortion

267
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,447
And then be like well it's going to be a Children of Men scenario like

268
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
F*** you

269
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
No it is a little

270
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
A little annoying

271
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
Also small note when Alex is aluminum aerosol spraying at the end there he's saying Chemtrails in a way that he wants to

272
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,015
To make it look like he's not saying chemtrails

273
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Crazy sinkhole

274
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Yeah he sucks

275
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Hey look

276
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Humans are going to be killed off

277
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
We're all going to be killed off

278
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
But not just us

279
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Wait not just that well I mean yeah.

280
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
The biosphere is going to

281
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,215
The f****** die in like 5 years 90% of all species are going to go extinct within the next five.

282
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
You know that's really going to hit hard

283
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
The bugs

284
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
Will you go on a trip in the summer

285
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Brother spring

286
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
11 places that have a lot of bugs like Minnesota

287
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Or Texas or Florida

288
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
25 years ago

289
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
In spring or summer

290
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Being a squeegee at a gas station

291
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
And squeegee

292
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Bugs off of that would Harden

293
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
The bottom of a plane

294
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Your hardest get out

295
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Ragazze would Harden

296
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
On the windshield

297
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
In the spring or summer in Texas

298
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
And there might be one

299
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
Bug on my windshield

300
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
1 bug

301
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
This makes it sound like Alex's

302
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
I had some experience with his car being egged

303
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
That's fair

304
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
So many scientists do believe that insect populations are declining but Alex's windshield is not really the best gauge for that

305
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Not very scientific

306
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
It tracks this would be how you prove his point though since everything is yours

307
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Just anecdotal and based on some

308
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
F****** hunch

309
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Alex has

310
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
The reality of the inside situation isn't

311
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,207
So easy to sum up in a quick blurb so suffice it to say that some species

312
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
The numbers are really worrying

313
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Except

314
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
For the realm of water-based insect

315
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
It would seem to be doing

316
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Doing quite well cuz everything else is going to die around them they're going to have plenty of food it's possible

317
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
What is attributed to this is like improvements made to freshwater habitats

318
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
To do better because of

319
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Clean water let's

320
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
Play shindig regulations

321
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
It's really hard to tell exactly what the

322
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Declines are caused by but according to an article about this

323
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,207
The BBC quotes

324
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Gone insect

325
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
Destruction of natural habitats due to urbanization to be the key

326
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
That would make

327
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,703
An important caveat to make is that this idea of like a widespread population

328
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
Decline it incites isn't the consensus opinion

329
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Almost everyone I can find us believe that there are insect populations that are at risk but there isn't agreement

330
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,247
About how Universal this is based on the data sets that are available

331
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
Another thing that does seem to be widely agreed on is that the populations that are going down are largely going down due to Urban

332
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Malaysian climb

333
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
A change and modern farm

334
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Calming techniques

335
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
What no one except one guy thinks

336
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
Is it there's a globalist plot to kill all the

337
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Right right

338
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
Right that's

339
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Yeah I I mean okay

340
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
As as a

341
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Uninteresting story

342
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
The when I was a kid there a lot of bugs

343
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
And now an adult and they're only one

344
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
That's that's fine

345
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,783
Sure but if you use any kind of thing like that to prove a point

346
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
You are done immediately done

347
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Well it's actually

348
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,231
What I was reading there is like a they call it the windshield effect

349
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
And the people are

350
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
They do notice this

351
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
It is it is something like a phenomenon that people have in their brain and I'm fine with that

352
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
That is still an unacceptable way of

353
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
Make an appointment make you think like

354
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
And I look into it more

355
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,527
Exactly supposed to be like well this should not be in a conversation with me being like here's how I know it

356
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
It's true you know

357
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Get out of here

358
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
I was just going to get to the news but that

359
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Please.

360
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,767
All this other news and I will control

361
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,351
Film 2000 music

362
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Frog

363
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
What

364
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
And so much more

365
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Route 24 hours

366
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,967
But you got to read the Bible about a fallen into tea on the planet

367
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
You gotta

368
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
That hates us because we're related

369
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Today

370
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Powerful Army present

371
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Did here

372
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
Manipulating

373
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
To give up our Humanity

374
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
The Bible

375
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
The British government with Tintin

376
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,639
Check

377
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
The chaplain exactly

378
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
If you're trying to express that you believe that the Bible is full of accurate predictions and this is what you got you're doing a really

379
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
A bad job

380
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,679
The first thing Alex points to is World Government which doesn't exist regardless of how many times Alex insist

381
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
But it does

382
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
The second Bible says there's going to be 10 kingdoms

383
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
How many are there

384
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:05,919
Well even if Alex is trying to claim that the UN is the world government there's not ten regions in the UN

385
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
The African group the Asian Pacific group that

386
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,111
Eastern European group the Latin America and Caribbean group and the Western European and other

387
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Group

388
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
I guess if the Bible predicted flying ships

389
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
Then I have to concede that that one was spot-on

390
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
There is not a mark in people's hands and forehead

391
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Do buy and sell so that one

392
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Hasn't come true

393
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
The family has not been broken up

394
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
People still have family

395
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,896
All the time from the Train

396
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
Five of these families on a windshield there in so many TV shows

397
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
JailTracker

398
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,464
Alex is trying to strengthen his argument that the devil is attacking him by pointing these things at the Bible's got and that's what he

399
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Comes up with

400
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,840
Much better list

401
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
There's a whole lot of text in that book

402
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
And there are some things that could be

403
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
Racine is accurate prediction

404
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
But Alex

405
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Just doesn't know any of that stuff

406
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,848
The only Bible verses he seems to never the ones that he can use to support gun rights

407
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
A John Birch Society newsletter to grind a one-world communist government

408
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
Eisenhower was setting up

409
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
To do with writing the Bible so

410
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
Yeah I mean the Heat quotes

411
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
Remember sending that book

412
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Jefferson

413
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,912
Definitely

414
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Alex Alex

415
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
Some feelings about January 6th

416
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
Of course

417
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Sure

418
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
And you think he's going to be blamed

419
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
For that that whole thing

420
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
No.

421
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
Washington Post articles

422
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Wall Street Journal

423
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
New York Times articles this weekend

424
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Specifically

425
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,328
The committee is honing in on Rodger Stone and Alex Jones

426
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
1

427
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Hundred percent

428
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
PS

429
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
And we don't have a motive made us look like fools

430
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Be there's no evidence is not true

431
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
President Trump wear over a year

432
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,368
Before that ever happened to Rodger Stone

433
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
I've even our legal waffle events

434
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
On the 5th for the 6

435
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
It's fun how like Trump is my buddy I have his personal phone number turns to I haven't talked to him in over a year

436
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
That guy Franklin

437
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Absentee father

438
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
Rodger Stone didn't know anything

439
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Connections did he have people who organized the stop the steal settlers

440
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,720
20/20 Electric

441
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Sure

442
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,120
Alexander got his fraudulent permit to have his

443
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
Stop the steel rally there

444
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
After the fact

445
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
You look like a fool that does not mean you have no motive for the crime differently you might

446
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
Look like a fool you might look like

447
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:31,232
Exactly yeah yeah yeah

448
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
To overthrow the United States government

449
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
The larger

450
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
Larger Community had certainly some of those goals

451
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
I think Alex is a little bit

452
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
Touchy never heard of about Communications nevermind

453
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Who are they

454
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
Bruiser talking to prosecutors and are exposing

455
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Their Communications

456
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
All the way up

457
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Probably

458
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
Jewels

459
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Entrepreneur

460
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,920
How do you say bad things

461
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Ultrasound

462
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
I know some of the people there

463
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
As

464
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Taylor talking to the feds

465
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
Exposed

466
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
The dog people

467
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
Would actually make stuff up and

468
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Who do you know Alex

469
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,616
Oh boy you know do you know bezo Keepers who plead guilty to seditious conspiracy

470
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
I think the store roads isn't saying he's turning

471
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
Who do you know you think you know

472
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,624
That's not good

473
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
The truth about you

474
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,280
It seems a little bit defensive about just the idea cuz

475
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
This I think is what

476
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,400
Inspiring this conversation on his show is that

477
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Barry's best news of

478
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
The goalkeeper

479
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Gentleman

480
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
Who played guilty

481
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
Who in that in the statement of his

482
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Defense

483
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
It does include that part of

484
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:29,248
Stuart Rhodes calling somebody to try and get in touch yeah

485
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
The Galaxy's a little bit touchy about these communication

486
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
There's all these headlines everywhere

487
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
When none of that happened

488
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
None of that went on

489
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,056
Animal Control

490
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Dawn

491
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Is mafia boss

492
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
Alex said that he hasn't spoken to drop in over a year at the

493
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
How would he know if there was or was it

494
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
Communication between any of the oathkeeper folks

495
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
And people in Trump's orbit

496
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
But like you don't have any idea about that so the blanket denial isn't

497
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
Persuasive

498
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
Rodger wasn't involved in anything right right

499
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,728
People who pled guilty

500
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
D2 seditious conspiracy

501
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Structure

502
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,896
Address to the committee

503
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
Could be having trouble here

504
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
This could be trouble I would have plead the 5th if I were on his own show yet I don't know anything about this but Alex will hyper.

505
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
Defensive about the idea of oathkeeper communications

506
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,768
We know that Stuart tried to get in touch with Trump through an intermediary who refused to put him in contact and there's

507
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Barry

508
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Very slim chance of that could be out

509
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
I think that there's a

510
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
Very very very tiny

511
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,728
I would not bet on it I don't think that's the case

512
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
I think that Alex is more defensive because if there is like sort of a straighter line but interrupted The Oath Keepers

513
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,224
This whole thing looks real bad I mean God damn

514
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
Terrible Mark Meadows

515
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
It could just be the Alex Rec

516
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Noises

517
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:15,744
Is damning stuff and that a guy who's been a guest on his show for over a decade was trying to contact the president

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,584
Have him authorizes paramilitary group to overthrow the government by force

519
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,680
And then Alex had that guy on his show repeatedly after January 6th to Creek

520
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Conspiracy theories

521
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,104
But I was really the reality is here whether the full shape of it is

522
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
There's a nerve

523
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,224
Been taught to know however that it was a Honeypot for bucket

524
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Tor who got them

525
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,392
To do all of that stuff right they wanted to do and we're going to do when they got there regardless of whether or not there was a Honeypot

526
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
Provocative

527
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
I was just trying to get in touch with Trump in or do you like hate

528
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
Like to do this

529
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Laid out a Honeypot

530
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
It's delicious

531
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,312
I want to put my hand in there trying to get the recipe for this

532
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
Very long time

533
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah

534
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Yep I'm not convinced

535
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:12,064
Is Rodger Stone like Eeyore

536
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Betty York

537
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Alex Guzman

538
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
Commercial and comes back

539
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Can break and

540
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
Typically we Greg Reese and John bowne reports

541
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Play in that

542
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
First segment of an hour where it's not broadcast

543
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
On the main body of the chauffeur

544
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Gregory's

545
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
I accidentally listened to a little bit

546
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
God

547
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
The letter from Albert

548
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
Regarding the Illuminati plan

549
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
Is largely considered a hoax

550
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,024
The word Nazism in a letter

551
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
What is the desired outcome

552
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,800
Planned 9/11

553
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:09,152
And was intended to leave the people in the state of complete physical

554
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,040
Moral spiritual exhaustion

555
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Atheists

556
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
And revolutionaries

557
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
To create

558
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
And they will do this in order to force the people into Exterminating the Destroyers

559
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
Civilization according to this letter this Bloodbath

560
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
Christianity and Atheism

561
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
And lead to the pier.

562
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Lucifer

563
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
Has the new world religion

564
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
Does appear as if this is happening now freely

565
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,392
So the letter doesn't like the Muslims and the zionists Flash

566
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
May

567
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Okay

568
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,840
So that's that's what I'm running

569
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,960
Generally speaking what I hear anybody bring up Albert Pike I tune the f*** out of that conversation

570
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
And I have the same response to her and Greg Reese's voice but

571
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,128
For some reason I decided to listen to a little bit of

572
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,504
Contract then now I want to resend and f****** Jamie XX

573
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Collaboration

574
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Solitaire

575
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
Buckley Buckley

576
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
She's decided to do a special report where the premises hey this letter is definitely a hoax but maybe it's still prophetic

577
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Yeah right that's about the brownies

578
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
What an amazing take the big letters

579
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,080
The Reese's covering is understood to be the creation of a guy named William Guy Carr

580
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,944
Since the earliest form of the letter can be found in his 1958 book Pawns in the game

581
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:52,064
Car was a really influential figure in terms of pushing out some early New World Order

582
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Conspiracy theories but of course

583
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
Also is a big old Auntie sound

584
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,048
He quoted heavily from the protocols of the Elders of Zion his books distributed by noon time

585
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Press

586
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
An anti-semitic publisher that was founded by Willis carto the founder of Liberty Lobby

587
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,520
Everywhere everywhere

588
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:17,664
The Press was meant to be the publishing outlet for cardos other group The Institute for historical review which is

589
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,504
Considered one of the largest disseminators of Holocaust denial content

590
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
In the world

591
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,416
Perhaps not surprisingly in 2009 a former new antidepressant Floyd James Von Braun carried out a screen

592
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
At the Holocaust Memorial Museum

593
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
That would make

594
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,584
I understand that be fake letter that Reese is talking about isn't just

595
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
The fake lighter

596
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,704
Hit the fake letter being read

597
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Conspiracy theory

598
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
So whether he realizes it or not

599
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
What Reese's doing

600
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,152
Is taking an anti-semitic Oaks which uses earlier anti-semitic Oaks is a citation

601
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Been using it

602
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
To suggest to his audience that while the

603
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
Monster Lee not a real letter that Albert Pike Road

604
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
Maybe there's an underlying truth to it

605
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
Right which is shity

606
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Right there goes bad work

607
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
F******

608
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Bacteria evolving in

609
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
A cesspool

610
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
You know just

611
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
Eggnog remarkable about A2 is like why did you do why is that

612
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Actual report is this in the news

613
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Deal was it

614
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,360
Right who pitched that in what meeting I would probably

615
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
This guy is a shat

616
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
What is he

617
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
What is

618
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Why

619
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
What why

620
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
Why

621
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Also when

622
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
When is it a good idea to be like alright this

623
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Obviously fake

624
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Obviously fake

625
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Yeah but what if it was right

626
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
That's kind of how a lot of these conspiracy f***

627
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
Deal with the protocols of the Elders of Zion they're like yeah

628
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,032
I still thought it was all the way real people who have more of a mine for optic

629
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
Admit that it's fake because it's so very clearly a very very clearly will fall back

630
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Macon like yeah it's a hoax

631
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
But it's actually talk

632
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,856
King about stuff

633
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
Through the medium of hoax that I tell the truth

634
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
Right right right

635
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
There's a there's a lot of that trying to save

636
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,352
Whatever can be salvaged showing wreckage of a hoax

637
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
He's going for the pike

638
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
Probably heard

639
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
So

640
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
You know this is Supreme Court

641
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Opinion

642
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Leeks

643
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
We know that it's antifa that did it

644
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Antifa working

645
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
As a as a clerk

646
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Nai

647
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
In the Supreme Court

648
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,904
Yes that's the most important part about all of

649
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,304
Opinion

650
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Make me that the headline

651
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,680
How about the league stuff right not saying heavily cuz what's important

652
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
Abbott now Alex

653
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Detect

654
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Skip cap

655
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
He's figured out who did this who did it

656
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Whodunnit

657
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
Whodunit as you gathered all of the suspects there is around a table to slowly tease out who did the crime

658
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
Percula Jones

659
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
I'm going to tell you exactly what's going on

660
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
I believe John Roberts is the one that leaked

661
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
Wow

662
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
Democrat or Republican

663
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
We know that since February of last year it's come out

664
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
On the Supreme Court ruling

665
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Using the power machine

666
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Record

667
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
And the wars in the pedophilia

668
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
The election about abortion

669
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
Yasso John Roberts

670
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,752
Release this in order to get people fighting

671
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
Before the midterms because I guess he wants

672
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Democrats to win

673
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
I mean

674
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
Bite my theory on why

675
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
It was John robber

676
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Is because

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
None of the other just

678
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,344
Is it if it is a Justice and not like a clerk

679
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
She's more likely to be a clerk

680
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Or something

681
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
But if it is a Justice

682
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
John Roberts is the only one who would

683
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
I'm making weird

684
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,656
Face again

685
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
The other liberal just

686
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
Justices who signed on the opinion

687
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Have known what's going on

688
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
For a long time

689
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,616
Why would they suddenly choose this point in time to do it

690
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Right

691
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
The conservative justices

692
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
Have been masturbating

693
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Furiously since they got to sign them

694
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Non-Stop

695
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Blood everywhere you know that Kai

696
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
But John Roberts

697
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Is if you look at his career

698
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
Obsessed with the quartet

699
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Itself

700
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
I'm trying to make sure that it maintains this air of being

701
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Illegitimate

702
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Part of the government

703
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Write any stay over

704
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Turner board

705
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Which they will do

706
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Then it's very obvious

707
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
Even to John Roberts

708
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
This Supreme Court is f******

709
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:07,200
Stupid well even buy your own reasoning that kind of

710
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,552
Would be an argument why Roberts didn't do it because he's such a fan

711
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Institution of the court that you wouldn't

712
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,184
Leaked document but he's the only one who thinks that the opinion could be

713
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Put helix

714
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,144
The sanctity of the courts and all this

715
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,984
You apparently Alex

716
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Exactly

717
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,360
Listen to people in the world

718
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
I think it's

719
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
More likely

720
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
But it was a cat burglar

721
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Ruled out that if possible that it was a staffer from somebody

722
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,208
But if it was going to be a Supreme Court Justice

723
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Who did it

724
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Which would be silly

725
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,352
Okay so I may go long with you if that's what you're stipulating

726
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
If you're stipulated

727
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
B48 Supreme Court Justice most likely candidate

728
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Freeport

729
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
But in the totality of

730
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
Possible people probably

731
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Who did it

732
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,416
I think will be interesting to see how that plays

733
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
We'll see

734
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
To someone who was recently found not guilty

735
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
Although I don't think that's actually what happened

736
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Well wasn't

737
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Has he was found buried

738
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Marjorie Taylor Greene though

739
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
She was found not guilty

740
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
She gets to run in her Alexa

741
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,360
I don't know I know

742
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Marjorie Taylor Greene

743
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
Call the big win

744
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
Carrabba's

745
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
What's unconstitutional

746
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
Despite its constitutionality

747
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
Wrong she wanted last election

748
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
Lady of Courage

749
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Sabrina

750
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:11,360
Green is facing an accusation of participating in an Insurrection which would have made her ineligible

751
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Be re-elected

752
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,272
Nothing involving this case was unconstitutional I was just decided the people Prosecuting the case didn't provide sufficient evidence

753
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Big picture though she lied

754
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
Cool bunch of night hearing

755
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,184
And also she want her last election by wide margin because it's a disc

756
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Cricket's Wings heavily Republican

757
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
And because her opponent had dropped out of the

758
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
I mean

759
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,400
It is it is very funny how little consequences there are four

760
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
For anything if you have

761
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Money order

762
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Like none

763
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
It's in his disgusting people are losing their minds

764
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Think that it's

765
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,432
There should be some sort of a consequence for the blatant lying

766
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
They're what I do also think that

767
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
Wow I agree that you should not

768
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
There should be a very high standard that must be met

769
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Short order to block someone from Ronnie

770
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,560
Because the alternative

771
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,376
Of allowing that to be done on assertive

772
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,192
Roughshod basis

773
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
The damage of that would do would be like

774
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
Really bad let me throw this out at

775
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Okay so if somebody was very clearly there's tons of evidence that she was associated with the Moon

776
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Menands was

777
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
In contact with them on that day

778
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
So we've got that

779
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
Established

780
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
And then the other stuff that we don't have established

781
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,208
We know for a fact she lied about on the stand

782
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,560
Those two combined I think are enough

783
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
Well if you can't convince a court of that that's kind of on you

784
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
So

785
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
You know exactly

786
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,288
Alex has some ideas about why she wasn't

787
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Found guilty

788
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
She should be able to run

789
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,736
Let me just like our last episode we found that he has no idea what the Constitution says once again

790
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
He is showing his ass

791
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,416
A dozen members of Congress like Gozer in others

792
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,488
The judges said it's unconstitutional

793
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
I'm not going to hear

794
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Get on

795
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
If they were convicted felons run

796
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
Like once you've done your time should be able to

797
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
I've great

798
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Alex

799
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
He doesn't know anything about the Constitution

800
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
Because I guess he thinks the people who've been convicted of a felony can't run and I can be true you can also still run for

801
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,672
You can run for any federal office even if you're a felon

802
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Check even points out in 1798 Representatives Matthew lion ran for Congress

803
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
Prison + 1

804
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
Houston to seat in Congress after serving for months

805
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,264
It's different for state-level offices depending on the state but that doesn't have to

806
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,104
To do with the Constitution and Alex's talk about members of the US Congress

807
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,175
So it's all federal level s*** he just doesn't know anyting

808
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,015
But this document that he pretends to love so much and willing to die for

809
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
No s*** document keeps people from doing stuff like what he wants to do so of course

810
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
He doesn't know anything about civics

811
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Glassell my God that would

812
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Would cause a

813
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
F****** explosion might resign

814
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
Amazon job

815
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
Hey runs himself from that class

816
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
Is it relates to the case against

817
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,799
Let's go sarthi this was a judge from Phoenix who dismissed the suit that was seeking

818
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
Barham Andy Biggs and marks

819
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
Syndrome from being on the ballot because they participated

820
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
In an insurrection

821
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
The judge interpreted the rule included in the Fourteenth Amendment to require a conviction for participation

822
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
To Bar someone

823
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
So that case

824
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
It was thrown out

825
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
Different states make different decisions so this

826
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,279
Marjorie Taylor Greene that was Howard judge in Georgia

827
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
Decided tippers

828
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,679
There's nothing unconstitutional about it but it did ultimately reach a similar conclusion

829
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
And Alex should be thrilled with it

830
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,799
Illustrates the ways that states are able to determine their own policy

831
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
For themselves

832
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,407
Operate outside the control of the federal government that he hates Obama

833
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
What are you complaining about dick

834
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
I think it's unconstitutional

835
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
Great for the states to act

836
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Different from the weight

837
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
I think it's

838
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
22 Chanel

839
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
For the federal government

840
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
To tell states that they can't that wait no

841
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
What does position on the cost

842
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
Fusion black

843
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Okay that's

844
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
Got it so we Alex Goes to calls

845
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
And this is worth

846
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Things kind of fall off

847
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Because I

848
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
What would it have been

849
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Quite a while back

850
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
So I don't recall

851
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:35,807
The people behind qanon like a week to unveil themselves if you was going

852
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
I mean never tell you never did

853
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
This color brings that up

854
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,863
A question he says

855
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Who is q

856
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,727
Would you like to elaborate on that and then I'll tell you who she is

857
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Thank you

858
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
2 years ago

859
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
Coochie was and how impossibly it exchanged hands

860
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
And things like that

861
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
At one point you threaten that

862
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,367
Come out and say who they were themselves that you were going to do it

863
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,743
Maybe you didn't cover it at some point but I never did hear

864
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Games named

865
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
What is fascinating about this

866
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Clip is that it

867
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Clearly shows that

868
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
I was always talks about how he doesn't

869
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,567
Screen calls yeah but like he knows this guy called before

870
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
He even talks to sleep whatever the call screening process is Alex he's the question that the persons going

871
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Going to ask

872
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,575
Before they come on answer that kind of invalidates his entire thing pretty much

873
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
Now here's Alex's answer and boys

874
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
It's not good

875
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
But I never did hear

876
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Games named

877
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Well

878
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
I'm on record saying that

879
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
He was lying

880
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
That

881
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
So that's a no

882
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,879
Okay sure

883
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
Could not have said more

884
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
Owensville loudest

885
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:26,143
Pause I've ever heard it was screaming in my ear I have no idea I don't remember saying that

886
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,471
I don't know

887
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
What am I doing

888
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
I need a new call screener this sucks

889
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
He was so prepared to

890
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
To tell the person who killed

891
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,783
But he was not prepared to have to say that there was

892
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Previous

893
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Call back

894
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Back to when he said this early

895
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
This is not just like someone randomly saying hey tell me who you said you were going

896
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,887
Unveil who these people are in Endeavor did that who are the names

897
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
Quicks

898
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Well

899
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Coos Bay

900
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,335
So I'm on record as saying that you is not telling the truth

901
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Oh boy

902
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,199
Not going to go well party run out of gas

903
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
He doesn't give a great ass

904
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
She was such a horrible thing

905
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
That I

906
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Talk about it

907
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,695
Who is anonymous

908
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,535
So what you people call and ask me who what

909
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
If any group

910
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
What's to call themselves

911
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Anonymous

912
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Esoteric

913
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Occult means hidden

914
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,639
We went on

915
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,967
When I go to the satanic 4G with a woman killed

916
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,831
You don't know who anyone is there wearing masks

917
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
Now I got you.

918
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,815
Who is QQ is a NADA by everyone

919
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:03,167
And some people and anyone who wants to be but then they can also stop

920
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Guy Fawkes

921
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,031
Texas qrq

922
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Jesus

923
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
Yeah

924
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,455
So Alex doesn't really have an answer but he does call it a

925
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,783
The question of who is q is a

926
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:24,415
Musically racially-charged

927
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
Tar-Baby

928
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Wow

929
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
Puzzled that they love us f****** wow

930
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,679
They want to feel like they're part of something Magic

931
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
Getting orders from President Trump

932
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,079
And that everything was fine he was I was going to get arrested

933
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,199
What I do

934
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
People

935
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
And yes I do know what happened with you

936
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
What happened with it

937
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
No one wants the truth so I'm

938
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
How about that

939
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:07,679
Caller asks what no one wants to know this colors

940
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,519
God dammit that caller even even at the beginning was like

941
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Listen

942
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
I can't listen all the time

943
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
So maybe you were revealed it when I wasn't

944
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Listening

945
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
So that gave you an out

946
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
He was overly polite

947
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
Yeah he was doing his best

948
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
Even though he knew for a fact that you never fuc

949
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:30,975
He said it I don't know I don't know that to be the case I think this color seems like from the other things he says I think his collar seems

950
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,607
Like a polite I think this might be

951
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,447
It maybe you didn't say it was genuine

952
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
I find it offensive for Alex

953
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
To take a direct question

954
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
What is a bright and then he'll be like look

955
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
I know what it is

956
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,711
But no one wants to know so how about I don't say

957
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
Right

958
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
Question Barros

959
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
News today

960
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
Time to take the mask off

961
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Lander if there is names to name

962
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,887
The craziest Boogeyman and certainly if the

963
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
Government want to know who it was

964
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Find out

965
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
10 days if they want

966
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
What they don't want to say it

967
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Yeah

968
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
Who started it

969
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Experts inoperative

970
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
Right out of the CIA

971
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Here's what happened

972
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,943
I'm excited to hear what happened with q but I don't know how much more clearer Alex can make it to the audience that he doesn't have any

973
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,527
Specific information he's just only interested in speaking in Vegas

974
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,087
Platitude that can't be proven or disproven

975
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
In the span of this call is given multiple excuses why you can't say the names of who is q because

976
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
He doesn't have a name to give

977
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
If he gives

978
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,583
The name may be stuck with that being a story

979
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,679
Specificity is the enemy of conspiracist

980
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Super Why

981
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:21,823
If he stays in the Evie says a name and that name is somebody just proven his being cute he looks really bad

982
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
If he wiggles around makes up fake excuses for why you totally knows the truth but he isn't going to say it you can't Rick most of the eye

983
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Guardian to think

984
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
He's telling the truth and there's some compelling reason

985
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,599
But he's not saying anything

986
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Sure

987
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,183
It's honestly a very similar Dynamic to what he's

988
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
Complaining about whiskey

989
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,535
He's saying the people love the mystery of it in the unknown

990
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
Alex's just exploiting the exact same thing in his listeners

991
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
It's only intriguing until he gives the name and then

992
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
It's boring as hell cuz

993
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,007
Who cares

994
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
The Watkins

995
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
Like it's Boris Johnson

996
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
Joey says that name you can trick yourself into thinking that he's got deep levels of holding back for some series considered

997
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,295
Duration but much like you it's all bulshit

998
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
Oh yeah just a what if

999
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
Alex is a bit of a

1000
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
GoPro

1001
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Because

1002
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
He starts trying to explain what Q is

1003
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,399
And I think he realizes that like there's not really anywhere to go with this

1004
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
I'm going to have to do something

1005
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Different

1006
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
In order to change

1007
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
The conversation

1008
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
Here's what happened

1009
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,383
We were very successful exposing the

1010
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Satanism angle

1011
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
WikiLeaks

1012
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
Election 2016

1013
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
I need someone on the inside

1014
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
Was giving out accurate information.

1015
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
So

1016
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
There's a bit of a like

1017
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,799
Annoyance at the caller there

1018
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
But Alex

1019
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
Ask the color request

1020
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,943
You said do you remember that from the 2016 election

1021
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
Mccalla responded to that

1022
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Anyway that

1023
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
Makes sense

1024
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
Based on the question that was asked novices

1025
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
I've got to start over

1026
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,183
As if it's somehow derails him or whatever

1027
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,255
And that's the beginning of him just lashing out at this caller

1028
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Because that's the new game

1029
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
The new game is no longer hey I I do not know who I have no idea who he was and if I do I don't want to tell you

1030
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
That's why you do it

1031
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359
About this

1032
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,175
And you'll forget what it was yesterday when I'm done

1033
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
My throat hurts

1034
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,367
Exactly what's going on

1035
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,767
Specific stuff

1036
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
Rodgers said

1037
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,143
And you responded back with somebody was giving information

1038
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
What

1039
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
That what you want

1040
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,407
Did you hear what I just said

1041
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,479
In the lead-up to that what did I say to you right before

1042
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
You responded back with that information

1043
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,439
I'm a little nervous on my toes

1044
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
We lost

1045
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
Call Mike

1046
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
My God

1047
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,423
How dare you say yes sir like you were being dressed

1048
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,823
Doubt but if it's a moron that you've been tricked into

1049
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
Looking up to

1050
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,503
Cannot be held to his word from back when he said that he was going to expose Q by names they did

1051
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,575
Publicly revealed themselves sleep in a little bit underwhelming

1052
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:49,695
Alex decided to launch into a big thing about his interpretation of Q stuff in the caller said something which is

1053
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Dude Perfect

1054
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,071
Emotionally abused this color instead of having to take anything of substance

1055
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,911
Before the caller said anything Alex it only said that he'd been

1056
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
Unsuccessful in getting sex traffic

1057
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Information out

1058
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
And that Wikileaks had released information

1059
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,055
About the 2016 election

1060
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,919
There wasn't anything like it was a revealing specific in their the discolored failed

1061
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
The grasp

1062
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
The question

1063
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
Did you hear me

1064
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
He said do you remember that

1065
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:21,439
It's just Alex like presenting the situation differently that just happened a minute ago so he can

1066
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,743
It's nonsense. This is what

1067
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
Weak bullies

1068
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
Yes

1069
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
Also another distraction tactic

1070
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
But he's employed

1071
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:36,287
Alex Fields kind of called out about how he said he was going to name cute and he knows that he can't do that so he's got to spend some

1072
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
It's just horrible that one of the places decided

1073
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,431
Let's go with his making this caller feel like Alex isn't able to make

1074
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
His points because of him

1075
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
He's fault somehow

1076
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
No that's that's

1077
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Book abuse

1078
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
I mean

1079
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
It really couldn't be much more gas lighter even that

1080
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Jesus

1081
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,167
This man for quite a while

1082
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Save face

1083
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Yes sir

1084
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,343
Two people

1085
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,695
Wait I thought he is the worst people on earth

1086
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,743
2 is the New World Order

1087
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
She was a psyop tulita surroundbar noses

1088
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
Start over

1089
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
Filmmakers in a family

1090
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
He's not a bad guy

1091
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Yeah he's completely schizophrenic

1092
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:49,503
I feel like all this makes it all the more important rileks the name name so the world can know who it is

1093
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,647
It's using this new world order siop to hurt people and not mislead

1094
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
They destroy the world it's because of them that we lost America he's making

1095
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,607
Argument against his own position this is banana

1096
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:10,239
I would dare say that if revealing who this person or group is would lead to some people being freed from the delusion

1097
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Kubo

1098
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,567
How much is a moral obligation

1099
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
Antonym names

1100
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
He's not going to though because he doesn't have any name

1101
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,711
Peter says b******* vagaries and feeling

1102
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Yes

1103
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,271
The Shield is ignorant

1104
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,087
Attention to what's actually being discussed

1105
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
So true

1106
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
What he's doing this is

1107
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
Athletic that

1108
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
Yep

1109
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
He should be really sure

1110
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,095
I don't know if he is able to access those feelings really lucky

1111
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,399
He doesn't have the capacity for shame

1112
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
True

1113
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Little baby in a box

1114
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
It's locked

1115
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:46,079
There's my cue but they don't care about Alex's covid

1116
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,127
Stuff enough

1117
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
Here's my frustration

1118
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,855
I can give you the emails in the documents enough shut them they're probably 50 times

1119
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,839
Covid-19

1120
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
And no one cares and no one listens and no one knows about it

1121
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,567
Puff the Magic Dragon

1122
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
As I don't care enough about his

1123
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,759
Covid-19 people have responded quite well to that

1124
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
3 million-dollar

1125
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,111
Is going quite well

1126
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,903
August just another Dodge

1127
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,719
There's something about this but Alex really wants to

1128
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
To distract from

1129
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,071
No s*** and you can't name someone

1130
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
Without risking another possible defamation lawsuit

1131
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,727
I was probably knows a name someone is Q they're probably going to get us

1132
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,543
Certain amount of harassment because of it possibly even

1133
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Escalating to violence

1134
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,663
Because he's presenting this is not a gas but as a known fact

1135
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,479
He probably bear a little bit more responsibility if this happen

1136
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
So he knows that that is not a path you can go down if you've said that they're the reason you lost the country and their aglow

1137
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,927
Mobile inmate calling January 6th

1138
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,767
And then you give their name the person probably going to die

1139
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,375
Well at least get a lot of death

1140
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
Virtual

1141
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:19,263
At the same time based on what Alex has presented there's literally no reason not to name

1142
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
These people

1143
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:26,431
He was a psyop that's leading good people astray it's run by the New World Order it's destroying the country and Alex knows who's behind

1144
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:31,295
If you're a listener who believes Alex there's no reason not to name names but because Alex

1145
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
Can't he has to create a wreath

1146
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,623
That's what you're seeing here

1147
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,999
Moving around trying to find an emotionally satisfying reason for why he can't name

1148
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,023
And he's coming up

1149
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,839
Well I mean and in this situation

1150
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
That person

1151
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,703
818 arguable that if you believe what Alex is saying

1152
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
You should go kill diapers

1153
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,031
Yeah you know

1154
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,823
Like in index.

1155
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,151
That's why he cannot he cannot give a name

1156
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Because

1157
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Based on what he's just said

1158
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
A name would be a death sentence to that person for a True Believer I mean I guess the way you get around that

1159
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Something is like

1160
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,791
It's not so much of that sentence as it is you should be tried for treason admit

1161
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,607
Qgenda for leprosy

1162
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,959
The cases you put this person in significant Danger

1163
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
And Alex is pretty

1164
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
Kionrightnow tonight

1165
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
Gets sued again

1166
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,639
He has a pretty pretty relevant recent

1167
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
Experience of that soap

1168
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
I just

1169
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
I'm fascinated by this

1170
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
This

1171
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Ping

1172
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,903
Amity is towards you or

1173
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,975
He lost a lot of money on that

1174
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Yeah

1175
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:50,143
I think it's interesting that this caller is asking that and Alex needs to do like an hour

1176
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,495
Yeah for now we're almost yeah like instead of just sort of brushing aside the question

1177
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,287
He needs to do this

1178
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
Because it's

1179
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Something

1180
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,871
That if he didn't

1181
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
The caller the

1182
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,687
The audience would just be like

1183
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,503
Yeah

1184
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:09,343
He's going to reveal these people in the past he's being reminded of this on air

1185
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:14,719
So now he has to do a huge show out of this to make sure the people don't remember that

1186
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,279
These events have to remember something else

1187
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
Yeah

1188
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
And so

1189
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,423
That's where we are doing that you forced Alex

1190
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
To put on a

1191
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Big Smoke

1192
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,751
Screen of a performance

1193
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
And then

1194
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,847
Disappear into the woods

1195
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,383
And so Alex comes back

1196
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,687
Break and he apologizes to this caller

1197
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,087
Of course because that's what abuser State and then talked a little bit more about what he knows about you

1198
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:45,183
Serious

1199
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
I apologize to Adam

1200
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,535
Oklahoma last a very reasonable question and I got

1201
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
Because when I

1202
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,655
I'm a baby

1203
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,703
Gives me a headache

1204
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
And I got where and when

1205
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,079
And the biggest frustration is I know exactly one on

1206
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
And

1207
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,735
People don't seem to have our do hardcore document

1208
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,295
Your show is hours long

1209
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,879
You want to believe

1210
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
A lot of good people

1211
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:32,287
MTG General Flynn myself a certain extent

1212
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,127
What was going on with the cute thing

1213
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,015
This Anonymous saying

1214
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,087
And so well let's just try to co-opt it

1215
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
Away from the bad guys

1216
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Yet

1217
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Fuk up

1218
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
That's

1219
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
That's what wait

1220
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,263
So now you're telling me that General Flynn tried to wield the the influence over

1221
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,311
A cult-like following

1222
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,663
Online folks

1223
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
That seems healthy

1224
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,223
Hi

1225
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
Real quick

1226
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
I probably would want

1227
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
Well I would say that

1228
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
After the sick

1229
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,695
Which you've claimed

1230
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
Q orca

1231
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Castrated

1232
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,023
In order to make you look bad

1233
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
Flynn still sets

1234
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,191
True I think that this maybe in some ways and attempt

1235
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,287
To explain away why Flynn was a huge Kingsport

1236
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
He was trying to take it over for a little bit in the correct direction or whatever

1237
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
Cast in the past

1238
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,783
6 years have thrown out at least one or two cue things right

1239
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
Probably more than that I would too I mean I was being

1240
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
Conservative

1241
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,415
Yeah but Alex tries to convince Flynn

1242
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
To do something the probably would have had

1243
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Drastic concert

1244
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,327
And I told Flynn he ought to just come out and say he's cute

1245
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,631
Pikachu

1246
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,703
You good

1247
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
You just did

1248
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,431
I mean that's them all the off-the-record discussion unique

1249
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Yeah I think that's

1250
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:19,039
General Flynn

1251
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,111
That would be a really suck something for him

1252
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Yeah

1253
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Yep

1254
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,279
I am too really no way to reveal yourself is cute without

1255
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,863
Simultaneously kind of sounded like you're revealing yourself as the next

1256
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
Messiah

1257
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
Miralax

1258
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
I am

1259
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Cute

1260
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Also

1261
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
Reincarnation of Jesus Christ

Yeah

1264

This is a mass

1265
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:49,759
Still don't know who Q is a little bit about

1266
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,783
What his relationship

1267
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
Ship with qy

1268
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
14 years ago

1269
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Trying to fix Q

1270
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
Paul Joseph Watson

1271
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,543
In the election WikiLeaks

1272
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
What Helix is real

1273
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
The pedophilia

1274
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,687
Rings that are in the emails

1275
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,503
With John podesta and all the rest of it

1276
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
That's all real

1277
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Something like that

1278
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:31,231
Well they come out with

1279
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
You did that

1280
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
Evolve into tough going there

1281
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
Real real story

1282
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
With a fake story

1283
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
You had to fire Joe Biggs about

1284
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
Coverage

1285
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:05,279
Why was faking being freaked out and almost crying in an interview with the gates.

1286
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
This is so stupid

1287
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
You know it it really does

1288
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,679
Explain why all of our history is so f******

1289
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Stupid is because

1290
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
The people who won

1291
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
In wars and ship

1292
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
For so long

1293
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:22,943
We're exactly like Alex just recontextualizing everything in church

1294
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
The loss and I did look like an idiot

1295
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,759
But let me Rican text

1296
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:32,159
July's 2y I'm right always was and in fact I did not lose what's the same thing like on our 2003 episode

1297
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
About him like rewriting assigned he was wrong as the globalist

1298
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:41,631
QuikTrip

1299
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
His associates did a lot of pizza

1300
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
Navigate s*** but also

1301
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,031
Bumper sticker that said imq

1302
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
I don't know

1303
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,223
Obviously I know from

1304
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:02,623
Listening to him and hearing him say various things over the years for that was a finance

1305
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
Motivational

1306
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,719
Solid

1307
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,279
Alex

1308
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,095
I was trying to do that so they would

1309
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
Believe

1310
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,423
The right things or whatever but

1311
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
That's that's

1312
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
That's nonsense

1313
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,055
So I went with the formation of

1314
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
Kill

1315
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,127
Specific

1316
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
And then a lot of Patron

1317
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,967
Ministration

1318
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Intelligence

1319
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,671
Exposing the pedophile rings

1320
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,463
And Jeffrey Epstein

1321
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,279
Do it anonymously

1322
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,055
Really energized

1323
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
To the public

1324
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,159
Infowars

1325
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
Put their name on it

1326
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
Within a month

1327
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
By the other side

1328
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:24,543
A couple problems with his retelling of the story has never taken away by for Tanner 8chan

1329
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,615
It started on an exclusively posted on 4chan

1330
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Before migrating to 8chan

1331
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
Everything that Q was happened

1332
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
Beginning with cryptic post

1333
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
Made there which were then interpreted

1334
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,831
Discussed another online forum

1335
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,415
Basically what's going on here than Alex wants his cake and eat it too

1336
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:44,767
He wants to keep the general Vibe of qanon because it largely matches his

1337
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:50,143
Conspiracy worldview and to attack that too harshly would have blowback on his own dumb idea

1338
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,983
At the same time he doesn't want to have to take responsibility for him

1339
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
Answer to the fact that

1340
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
Acute

1341
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,823
Assistant Lee been wrong about stuff

1342
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,151
And the theories that grow out of that Cesspool are embarrassing and dangerous

1343
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
It often

1344
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Abby's medical nature

1345
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,271
Always said I do agree that he was inspired at

1346
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
At least in part by him

1347
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,879
The whole counter-coup narrative the key and Steve Rift about

1348
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,927
Through most of the lead-up to the 2016

1349
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,719
Is really close as a match

1350
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Do lot of Q's early mythology

1351
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,607
It definitely wouldn't be surprising to learn that a lot of that stuff was in some way in

1352
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,887
Inspired by Alex's

1353
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,167
Collaborative storytelling

1354
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,007
Also if what I was saying is true then Trump and his administration

1355
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
To be investigated and possibly charged

1356
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
For what they did

1357
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,407
Like they weren't just putting out the truth is too hot to handle

1358
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:39,551
Like if Anonymous shitposting on 4chan it was a propaganda effort from the federal government I don't think that's appropriate

1359
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,135
Do I think Alex himself would find that to be a very

1360
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Disgusting thing for a government

1361
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:48,511
To do what the hell I think he would be against it

1362
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
Yeah yeah

1363
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
Had a secret

1364
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,423
Propaganda Armand 4chan

1365
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
Anonymously she was saying

1366
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
Alex and his associates arrested or whatever all this cryptic nonsense and bull

1367
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Call Shay predictions

1368
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
Riling people up and then

1369
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
You know people

1370
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
End up killing

1371
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Jackson

1372
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Shooting into a pizza place

1373
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,367
Man it's so crazy with Hillary then

1374
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:19,743
Like Hillary could have done step-by-step everything that Trump did and they'd still be mad at her

1375
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,535
That's not enough

1376
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
You mean like

1377
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,375
From a policy and political science

1378
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
Assume so

1379
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Cuz it's not really about that

1380
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,239
No no

1381
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
No no no

1382
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,127
So Alex now realizing that he's talked about going on for quite a while

1383
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,431
Reassess is what the

1384
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
The caller actually asked

1385
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,295
I'm actually glad that Adam called in and asked

1386
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,695
Human what is Cube and answer is the same thing as Anonymous people done good thing is he

1387
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Packers

1388
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,743
Whitehead activity

1389
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:55,071
Call themselves anonymous

1390
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,911
And so anything

1391
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
That is

1392
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
It's a lot of fun for some people

1393
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,847
But it's very very dangerous

1394
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Not good

1395
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:14,271
So I guess he feels that he has successfully rambled enough and given enough of a presentation

1396
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,319
Change what

1397
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
The caller actually asked

1398
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
Colorado

1399
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,439
You said you were going to name names did you name names what are the names

1400
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,511
So much

1401
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
The question is now who and what is

1402
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,887
Qanon as opposed to water the name

1403
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,239
It's a direct question that he has now changed so

1404
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,775
Distracting leave that

1405
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
This caller

1406
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,335
Actually has been fools

1407
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
Okay

1408
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
In Oklahoma

1409
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,527
And God bless you Alex

1410
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
What you wrapped up there

1411
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
The reason why I called and asked

1412
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
Somebody people

1413
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
Episode

1414
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,743
He did not get an answer to his question

1415
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
The question that was asked

1416
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,047
Alex

1417
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,887
Operated him and emotionally abused him and then rambled enough

1418
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,471
Smooth over the woods

1419
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:11,615
Answer managed to make this guy feel like he got something out of the exchange as opposed to Alex just said nothing

1420
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
A half an hour

1421
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:16,479
Yeah it does feel like this should go into evidence as to why

1422
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:21,343
Deprogramming doesn't work then speaking of that immediately after that

1423
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
Anthony

1424
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
Conversation

1425
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,719
For you I'm sure for sure

1426
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,279
Father God thank you for

1427
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,887
Things that are coming to light in this world and I thank you for the

1428
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,703
Curry's Alex and his team has had

1429
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,823
I feel

1430
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,431
I don't know people who are like hey you know Alex is

1431
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,223
He's right about a lot of stuff

1432
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,039
I feel like this is a snapshot that maybe they should

1433
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,111
Really ask themselves some questions about

1434
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Oh yeah

1435
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:59,487
Entire presentation of head with the caller who asked about qanon the way it's handled

1436
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
The way of progress is ad

1437
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,327
The fact that it leads to this guy

1438
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
Having a prayer on air where he

1439
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,447
God for Alex's bravery

1440
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,471
It's nonsense

1441
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
This is called

1442
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,823
I wish there was like a bot we could have

1443
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:19,711
On every on the internet just bought that every time it said Alex it anytime it

1444
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,015
Detected like Alex was right

1445
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,343
Immediately follow up a reptile responsive just these clips

1446
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,135
Maybe like how do you feel about that

1447
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
Yeah

1448
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Defend it

1449
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,463
Well I think I think

1450
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,839
Some people who are maybe more Envy like sort of zealotry angle side of things

1451
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
They may be fine

1452
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:43,519
They probably want to maintain like

1453
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,079
Podcast be really embarrassing

1454
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,615
I really talk to answer for

1455
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:52,991
Man Christians feel the same way about the Bible that they do about the

1456
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
The tution

1457
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
Which is that

1458
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,575
Reading it is just

1459
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,623
Yeah terrible idea

1460
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
And praying in public

1461
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,695
Is exactly what Jesus

1462
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Told you to do

1463
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,767
Understand

1464
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,047
Is the Infowars

1465
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
This is the church

1466
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
And I do believe

1467
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
Infowars is the most

1468
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
Active Church on planet Earth

1469
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,727
Forgetting the word of God out

1470
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
It's the one that

1471
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Isn't holding back

1472
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,823
You don't read that Bible buddy

1473
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
Product you sell I really enjoyed X

1474
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
The product you sell

1475
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
Everything you saying

1476
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
You're risking your life

1477
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
Missha BB

1478
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:36,511
I mean come on these callers

1479
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,327
Saying that I why did I have to learn so much

1480
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,887
F****** Christianity only to hate it

1481
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:45,983
And then these people don't even know anything about it and then try and shove it down my throat all the time

1482
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
It's annoying

1483
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
That's very annoying

1484
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:55,711
I wish I would have flipped his desk after this caller was like a most important Church in the world

1485
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,295
You should know

1486
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,671
So Alice Cooper call from his longtime call Carlos

1487
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Nettles

1488
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
It's

1489
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
Annoying I remember every episode

1490
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
Santa is a little taste

1491
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,655
All of Alex's old buddy

1492
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
Wonder OG you know

1493
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
I'm looking my phone

1494
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
Michelle Rothschild

1495
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
17th

1496
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
1773

1497
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
A nation's money

1498
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
So that's almost certainly a fake quote

1499
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,351
There's no actual evidence that mayor Rothschild said that

1500
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,167
This quote is being said

1501
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,215
Hi by Hammer a little

1502
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:55,615
I dubious and there are some indications that a guy named Andrew Fletcher said in the 1600 long before

1503
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Rothschild was alive chair

1504
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:03,295
The prevailing theories of his quote was attributed to Rothschild and the early 1900's and there was a debate about the gold

1505
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,343
Right that was

1506
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:09,951
That was where the soda pops up into the modern Consciousness as being appropriate

1507
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
To make that up

1508
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,815
From him when you start seeing Rothchilds name attached to it

1509
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,351
Yeah it's

1510
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,679
It's nonsense after the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1511
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Well

1512
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,519
Spiders this collar and God bless him

1513
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,543
Fourth grade

1514
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:29,151
Let's get another call and this guy has a amazing suggestion for how Alex

1515
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Can make some money

1516
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
It's

1517
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
T-shirts

1518
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,599
Infowars

1519
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
And

1520
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
What if what if anyone has been in 1 oz

1521
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
You gave them back

1522
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,655
A 1/10 Oz

1523
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
Dogecoin

1524
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,151
I've got in the divorce

1525
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
And

1526
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,879
How about

1527
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,951
You build people for even more money

1528
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Damn I mean it's an interesting

1529
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,839
It's an interesting idea

1530
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,703
I mean it's a really all that different than the overpriced silver coins that he selling or

1531
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:28,799
Liver of the golden knights not really thick

1532
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
For the novelty is the golfer

1533
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,895
4 Gold transfer right right

1534
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,175
Open Spotify

1535
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,247
And it is finished ugly fun

1536
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,575
That's like if you send them in a gold statue in a

1537
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:46,975
The head off of it and gave it back to you right out keep up keep the rest of it you get the head

1538
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
Response to this guy

1539
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,535
And also some big

1540
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
I hate you

1541
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
I think I would be amazing

1542
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
70 likes

1543
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,383
Only the people that sit in the 1 oz

1544
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,175
And then you can make nine

1545
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,223
1 trillion %

1546
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:11,039
Android Note

1547
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,975
But we now officially know and it's going to come out soon

1548
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,279
Is George Soros battle Lawson's finest

1549
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
He's trying to take me down

1550
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:32,031
Wait wait you haven't sell that before we figured it out

1551
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
SA

1552
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,919
I can think of very few ways of

1553
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
Making money

1554
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
That

1555
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
AR

1556
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,551
More tailored to laundering

1557
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,599
Bambi

1558
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,879
Giving someone

1559
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Gold

1560
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,743
How do you say let's go or less goals

1561
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:58,911
And then not really keeping track of what it is that the value of what you have

1562
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
Then you're going to give him out

1563
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:07,103
Write like a really good way to

1564
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,663
Taken some money that maybe

1565
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:16,063
I mean if I was going to launder launder a s*** ton of money

1566
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
The Alex Jones

1567
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:20,159
It's another Avenue

1568
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:24,767
Yeah I mean it's also a ridiculously dumb

1569
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Very dumb idea

1570
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,375
What if I send you 10 Bitcoin

1571
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,167
And you send me one back

1572
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
That's a great idea right now

1573
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,775
So Alex that has some bad ideas like this

1574
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,591
The colors of bad ideas and here's one of Alex

1575
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,895
It is just that half an hour at least

1576
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
Rambling about qanon Shore

1577
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,991
I've dumped you is now it's a

1578
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:51,391
So I can attack on everybody favorite thing

1579
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,487
Taylor Greek god dammit

1580
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,559
MPG on the road graciously

1581
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,375
Meanwhile thank you so much

1582
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,167
Gratulations

1583
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,615
You weren't under indictment you're not a felon

1584
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,431
I had no reason to do this this really discredits them

1585
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
Chelation still

1586
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,039
Well thank you Alex

1587
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
Discredit

1588
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:29,279
Wow she's on speed dial now man she's she's coming in

1589
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,095
I think she think she's losing an election

1590
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
I don't know

1591
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,495
Interesting to try and read the passage of like her

1592
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Weather

1593
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,359
It is his frequent appearances problem

1594
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,663
For me to say she thinks

1595
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
That she's going to lose an election

1596
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:51,551
Implies that I believe she has some sort of ability to plan long-term

1597
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
And

1598
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,623
To recognize real

1599
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,183
Troon

1600
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
Anything could be possible in her brain

1601
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,119
Yeah I think also one of the problems we run into is that the behavior would be indistinguishable because

1602
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:11,775
Coming on Infowars a bunch could be trying to get the vote out get your name out there or it could be trying to lay tracks

1603
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,336
For a career after you

1604
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Loser

1605
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:21,504
Primary election I wouldn't be so quick to to make assumptions but

1606
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Man

1607
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
It is

1608
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
Bad news

1609
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,904
The combination of her and him

1610
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,000
What you posted that ultra-mega thing with a red eyes

1611
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,328
Signaling to like his dark magazin yeah

1612
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Alex's

1613
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:43,264
Certainly more recently talked a bit more about blackpill ideas. News is one of his website

1614
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,080
I mean I like this is not good these days

1615
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,896
You combinations in the influences coming together is

1616
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
Yeah

1617
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
It's not good

1618
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
It's the it's the larger thing that she's part of you know like if you go back and look at congress's through history

1619
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
It's a really looking at individual members

1620
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
I would be shocked

1621
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
To find a single con

1622
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
Concrete that does not have at least

1623
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,072
1 truly insane person

1624
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:10,912
Except there were also the president and the rest

1625
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,936
Congress

1626
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Her team to

1627
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,240
That's kind of my bigger

1628
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Yeah there

1629
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
Hey it's more troubling

1630
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,128
Yeah yeah I think

1631
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,200
I don't know why but it does feel different

1632
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
Van like

1633
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
Ron Paul showing up on how to show a line

1634
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Yeah

1635
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
I think

1636
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,744
Ron Paul has been into qanon

1637
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,144
Prior to him being on a show and then I would be as worried about Ron Paul

1638
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
What's what's

1639
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
2q i8

1640
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:50,592
It's like you're scary now kind of guy

1641
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:54,688
A cheap kind of guy right makes sense for them together

1642
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,552
Where is Marjorie Taylor Greene is a qanon weirdo unhinged who knows what the f***

1643
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,112
Yeah reality she inhabits

1644
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
And

1645
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
Yeah if she was a just a John Birch

1646
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,208
Kind of

1647
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,024
Ranbir Congress

1648
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,328
Instinctual worry about

1649
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:15,168
Was going on Alex's show

1650
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,520
Mannequin doll that seems like it's just cuz he's related to Ron Paul

1651
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
If I mean cuz

1652
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,384
Cuz Ron and Rand

1653
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Despite

1654
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:30,272
Being shity people and batshit nuts it is always felt like you would

1655
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,808
And you inhabit

1656
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
The same universe

1657
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,136
And everytime MTG speaks

1658
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
I'm like

1659
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,696
I don't know where you are

1660
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
I just

1661
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,280
Don't know where you are or what you think or what

1662
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:47,680
Older or how I wrestled with this a little bit I think his next clip actually will lay out a little bit of why because

1663
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,008
There is that inhabiting of a false reality

1664
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Somewhat there is also like I think

1665
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,592
This clip illustrates

1666
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
There are some

1667
01:22:56,384 --> 01:23:00,224
Indications that she also is very clearly aware

1668
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
The fact that there is another real real

1669
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,344
You're getting into something MCG really

1670
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Central here

1671
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
And that is

1672
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,720
These giant distribution centers in food

1673
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Factories

1674
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Processing facility

1675
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,144
Everyday statistically impossible

1676
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
Intel

1677
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,824
We look at the pipeline spring shutdown value the cloward-piven strategy.

1678
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,896
Destroying capitalism by sabotage

1679
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:32,224
So many signs

1680
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,272
What do you think's going on and what are you hearing

1681
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,648
Well I think

1682
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
Maybe more than just a

1683
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
Right now it's

1684
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
Especially in the past

1685
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
It doesn't seem to be

1686
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,664
It shouldn't be happening why is it

1687
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,552
This is a choice I mean what you just said is why

1688
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Food processor

1689
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,904
Yeah. There are these fires that have happened

1690
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,256
And Marjorie Taylor Greene even knows that these sorts of fires of these facilities

1691
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,048
Isn't Tropical Tan,

1692
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:22,656
She knows the actual actual explanation for the things that are happening but she also knows

1693
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,496
She only gets information from Outlets that are full of s*** like

1694
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:33,664
Infowars in Tucker these fires are useful only in so far as they are happening in food

1695
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,504
Which is why Marjorie Taylor Greene may think that they're all happening

1696
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:45,184
The conspiracies about the globalist attacking the food supply so that's the angle that full of s*** Outlets take on the story

1697
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,024
It seems like the perception that Marjorie Taylor Greene is mirror

1698
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:54,400
Just yesterday there was a fire at a textile plant in South Carolina but that's not leading the coverage cuz it Doesn't

1699
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
Conspiracy

1700
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,496
Yesterday there was also a fire at the Jeld-Wen

1701
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,800
Implant in Wysox Pennsylvania

1702
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
But this isn't part of the

1703
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,384
Conspiracy because the company that makes interior doors

1704
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,944
There's an explanation for the phenomenon

1705
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
Green is

1706
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,272
Discussing and she knows that explanation

1707
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,344
As proven by her saying the explanation out loud

1708
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,392
Gino's the reality but the

1709
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,672
Conspiracy is more useful

1710
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,768
So she leans into that ignoring reality in favor of her constructed world

1711
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:26,912
They're certainly other reasons but this kind of tendency disqualifies her I think for being someone who should hold public office

1712
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
If someone is

1713
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:31,264
Willington knowingly use conspiracy bulshit to persuade you towards

1714
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
Conclusion

1715
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,592
You can't trust their being straight up about anything

1716
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,384
Ever and I think that

1717
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,664
Bat-Mite

1718
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,712
Distinction between harappa

1719
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,296
I do believe that Ron Paul believe the ship that he says yeah

1720
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,832
Like I would think he's wrong and

1721
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,136
But I do

1722
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
I think that

1723
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,720
He sincerely believes you're that

1724
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,256
You know the fact is

1725
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:56,352
Or whatever maybe what I feel like is

1726
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
Difference

1727
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,912
Between

1728
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
Alexandra like

1729
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:06,080
If the difference of exploiting fake reality and trying to use it

1730
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,360
You are trying to make

1731
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,176
Fake reality usurp real reality

1732
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
Do you know what I mean

1733
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
Like Rand Paul

1734
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
As always seem like he's exploiting

1735
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
Fake reality

1736
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,600
Noe ZZ

1737
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
He's giving the bones

1738
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,440
To the people who need the bones to get his job

1739
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
Attempt

1740
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,280
Gigi really feels like she is trying to

1741
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
To destroy reality and replace it

1742
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
With the b******* Shiba

1743
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,448
It's hard it's hard to tell but there is

1744
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
There is something that feels

1745
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,592
I mean I don't want I don't think it is

1746
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:42,176
What is it possible that we're experiencing some low-grade misogyny

1747
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:49,344
I don't think it is

1748
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
What it would go

1749
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,440
You know what is the same time why in this

1750
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,232
Situation

1751
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,768
Misogyny even creep in

1752
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Scared about

1753
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:04,192
Reality not about women being involved

1754
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
Like

1755
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,776
My feelings and apply them on to somebody else

1756
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
Yeah and I think I would

1757
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,128
Feel just as bad as like Matt gaetz was on

1758
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
Like regularly

1759
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:22,624
That guy in Missouri whose Name Escapes me at the moment

1760
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,208
Holly holy on there that's

1761
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
That's almost scary

1762
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
It was

1763
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,072
You like to happening all the time

1764
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:36,448
It was like a regular guest ship of some of these other people who aren't women

1765
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
Are completely

1766
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,776
Terry Twomey

1767
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:45,920
Yeah maybe it's just I'm not scared of Ron Paul I think it's true we've been around

1768
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:52,320
He's been kind of grandfathered in as the defense guy three Senators passed the FED with his brother

1769
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,856
Brother

1770
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,672
We don't know that Ron actually think that the Wayne

1771
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
But yeah

1772
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,536
Maybe maybe we just have like a bias towards

1773
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,096
Old people being less harmful

1774
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:11,264
Maybe ideology is something that

1775
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,736
We don't have to worry about it clearly dealing with it

1776
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,760
Taylor green represent

1777
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,040
It's still kind of like

1778
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,904
Fully formed yet

1779
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
I don't know there's a

1780
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:34,304
Potential for Destruction more than Ron Paul Rand Paul is yes

1781
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,840
Lot of weird threads

1782
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
That

1783
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,656
Untangled

1784
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,728
But we've won last clip here and

1785
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,288
So really

1786
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
Dyke

1787
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,616
Just declare fully

1788
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,688
Performance

1789
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,784
I think everyone should be concerned about

1790
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
You know I don't want

1791
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,304
There's too many food processing plant

1792
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
No one in charge things

1793
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
Department of

1794
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,848
What is going on

1795
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
Mothers that grocery

1796
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,944
I can't find baby

1797
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Formula

1798
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
Which is just

1799
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,784
Horrendous and heartbreaking

1800
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,112
Farhan's I think it's

1801
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,136
Something

1802
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
ISeries attention

1803
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
And demanded

1804
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Navigation

1805
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:40,352
I wasn't using thousands and thousands of agents to arrest January 6th peaceful protesters

1806
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
We would have answers

1807
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:45,984
He has the answer to the question that she's demanding be answered

1808
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
And she told

1809
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
Yeah she already knows

1810
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:55,200
Advanced really isn't going to investigate this because there's a very ready statistics on this the show that this is not out of the normal

1811
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,504
And what do you want from the people in power

1812
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,528
Regulation

1813
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
Sure

1814
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,320
What up

1815
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:06,720
Is that what she's saying I mean besides a conversation

1816
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,488
Other than

1817
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Regulation

1818
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:14,144
The absence of the press conference that would ultimately lead to regulations is a grey top

1819
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
Pickle thing cuz then you can say that there's a cover-up of

1820
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:22,592
What is obviously agroterrorism whatever

1821
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:26,176
She doesn't believe any of this s*** and you can tell because

1822
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
She's already

1823
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:32,064
Explained it in this the very first production was here's why this doesn't make sense

1824
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,600
Right now I believe

1825
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:37,440

1826
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,464
Battle bomber

1827
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Man

1828
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:40,768
These people just

1829
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,536
Why all the

1830
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,864
Get away with you

1831
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
It's weird

1832
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,912
Yep

1833
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,704
What are people going to be like

1834
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
Think you're a liar

1835
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Overdue

1836
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:56,640
It would seem that way also I think it would be great if

1837
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:59,200
Hey you're a liar meant something

1838
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:05,600
Consequences for it haha

1839
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
You'll vote for me in August

1840
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:12,000
So this episode is

1841
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,560
First of all the Cuban on stuff

1842
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
Just outrageous

1843
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
Yeah and then

1844
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
Cannot

1845
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Except

1846
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,472
That we're living in a post

1847
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,032
The globalist playing can't be stopped world

1848
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,104
And this is the kind of show that he's deciding to do

1849
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,456
It is so hard to shake that because once the world has officially ended

1850
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,504
It's not going to own the end

1851
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,648
Or if it does like we've said before demand an explanation for why

1852
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,696
Walk us through this

1853
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:48,096
You said we're all going to die now calm us down by explaining why we're not

1854
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,680
Going to die man Oklahoma's going to call into years and be like

1855
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:58,080
Remember when you said that we were all going to die three years ago whatever happened with that did we do

1856
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,920
Ebola back

1857
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:06,528
And until then we have website
