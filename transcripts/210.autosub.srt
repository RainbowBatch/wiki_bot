00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Indeed we are

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,576
How many belts has illness

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
I mean never been hangovers

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Stuff that it made

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
Give me Second Life

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
You're so but

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Mild

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
Food

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
Terrible

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,176
From food weigh more than any normal person

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,992
I can't remember the last time

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
You limit your exposure

15
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Population

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
No

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,256
I know I don't I don't think that's why I'm out and about

18
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
Just like that I was never ever sick

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
But my girlfriend is

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520

Fighting through it as we get this adventure where I

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you know what does

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
If I ever heard it was

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Give a shout out

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384

00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,248

00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
And then

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Get down to the old to brass tacks

37
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544

00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Oops

00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,712
But then after he corrected

40
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
You are right

41
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Thank you very much

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
It's not okay

43
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
Every week

44
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Literally

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
Forget cuz we don't record on Wednesday

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,568
Every week completely forget

47
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Watch the little bit of

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,432
Camelot

49
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
Don't shoot the messenger

50
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
I thought you might be talking

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
To us through the screen

52
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
Who belongs on project but it was she was talking about

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
You what you have

54
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Understand

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
Is that most of my whistleblowers have been mind-controlled at some point

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
So obviously they're going to lie or bunch

57
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Which of the time

58
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
And you know what if they tell me a lie does that mean everything

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
Goodnight

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
Just made me feel really bad and I

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
I don't want to talk

62
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
Time for a while

63
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
And if any page comes back that's going to be a new episode for us

64
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
A soldier and like I don't know if I have it in my heart

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Made a new player

66
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
There's only one super soldier in that's Kurt Russell

67
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
What do you mean a racist alien it stuff

68
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Anyone else

69
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Compare quite frankly so

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
We'll see what happens

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
But for now Jordan

72
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
They said Wacky Wednesday we're sticking back in the

73
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
2009 episode for Monday

74
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
We did that interview

75
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Positive

76
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
I really appreciate it

77
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
2009

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
So desperate

79
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
The cover a lot of ground

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Did a couple days

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Taking care of

82
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
But I could

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,063
Today we are just doing March 9th 2009

84
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Just one day Just One Day 2019

85
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,143
There's a happy there's so much to learn back that every day brings us a new

86
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,239
Huge July but he's telling it's very excited for someone like me

87
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
Those were exciting times

88
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,639
We were just emerging into Barack Obama's presidency Wendell IB

89
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
The truth we were Wednesday

90
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
2009

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Stuff recently

92
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
We found Alex Jones

93
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Pretty much

94
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Whole Hog

95
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
For about a month

96
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,095
In a tenth amendment resolution

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
For all

98
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,959
Weird wraps on

99
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Bizarrely racist

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
All very problematic people

101
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
And they all come on about how the states

102
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Juggle a couple more narrative

103
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,183
Fall story about the avian flu release

104
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Buy into check

105
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Republic

106
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
And so we're all over the place

107
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Trying to find out

108
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Start song

109
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
And when he

110
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Besides ice tea party

111
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
He's pretty cool

112
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
And so far we've seen absolutely no indication

113
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Either of those

114
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
Question that I probably should have answered

115
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
On our previous

116
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Is 911 water still going strong

117
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,903
I don't know I didn't look at any of the front page of it

118
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:25,535
Irrelevant irrelevant

119
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
It still up

120
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
There's that somebody still renewing the register

121
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
Find archived County

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
We're in a place where it's at

123
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,687
Super weird you know I opened up this episode really

124
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Strongly

125
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
Continue down the avian

126
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,111
Trying to build

127
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Nothing

128
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
In the world

129
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Could have prepared me for this

130
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
Being the beginning of the episode

131
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,399
And the hour today

132
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Blockbuster film

133
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
Was released Nationwide on Friday

134
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
The Watchmen

135
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
Mulled over the characters knightowl the comedian

136
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
Doctor Manhattan

137
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Silk Spectre

138
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
I have never seen Illuminati in your

139
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Propaganda

140
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
Spoiler alert

141
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:43,615
I'm going to

142
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
It's just unspeakable

143
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Speakable

144
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
Ozymandias

145
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Apparently is unspeakable.

146
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Because he keeps

147
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
Calling him

148
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
30 time which is hilarious

149
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
You know what else could have called him

150
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
Asia if you didn't want to call him if he has trouble pronouncing

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Commandeer

152
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
By all means

153
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Gopher

154
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,607
There is no other way there play by Matthew good

155
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,983
That is exactly what Bill and Ted would have called Ozymandias if he was in Bill and Ted's

156
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
Who's the really funny thing about the fact that Alex

157
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
Really highlight ironic absolutely a proposed

158
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Mispronounce consider

159
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Like it was just a random a name

160
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
But it's not

161
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
No it's a reference

162
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Really

163
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,751
On the nose name for Alex today

164
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,591
Another name for Ramses the Second

165
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
There it's the illusion

166
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,223
Poems from 1818 by English.

167
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
And

168
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
The theme

169
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Those poems

170
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,439
Inform the understanding of Ozymandias

171
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Rosy Mound

172
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
His name is Ozzy mandamus

173
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Doesn't recognize me

174
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
The name of the literary allusion

175
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
He doesn't really have that much of a

176
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
The name Depp

177
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Review,

178
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
Absolutely not

179
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,407
I bet he doesn't even know who

180
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Probably not

181
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
Apropos

182
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Sing for

183
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Reference

184
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Considering

185
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,951
Frankenstein

186
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Contacts

187
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Situation where

188
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Seems seems that way

189
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
I was expecting

190
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Science

191
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
And Lex Luger

192
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
So when I jumped in and

193
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,991
He comes out of the gate being like I'm going to tell you all about the Watchmen

194
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,559
The info Warrior Nation ears or Alex ghost

195

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
Graphic novel

366
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760

00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Thing that I'm

371
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008

Down the street

I was really worried you're going to save the black kid reading the comic on the street

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,912
I don't know why you wouldn't just go ahead and read it if you thinks it's like the Illuminati Bible

00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
IHeartRadio

386
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Physically hard for him

387
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Hurt him

388
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
And some way otherwise I don't see why you so averse to doing it

389
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,856
The gist of it

390
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
But I think he might have done that

391
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Cable

392
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Some of the wrong man

393
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
And maybe some wrong message

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Pictures about the movie

395
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
D2 and one of the first ones

396
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
Is a Illustrated Alex

397
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
You cannot breathe on Mars

398
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
I don't care

399
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
But here's the first what I would do

400
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Describe

401
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Massive

402
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Misunderstanding

403
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Watchmen

404
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,944
I've done some basic research

405
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
A picture of Watchmen

406
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,808
Mason

407
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
And end all of this Illuminati

408
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,768
Cookie also Alex and 28

409
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,864
When you're drunk doing interview in a hotel room

410
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,264
Also that I forgot that that's the reason I brought that up is that in order for

411
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Is like a narrative

412
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
It's some point between 2009 and

413
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
2018

414
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
In that nine years the Illuminati had to have literally been

415
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
It's some point remember him

416
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:00,928
Idea

417
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
But

418
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
If you look on the cover

419
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
Smartest man in the world

420
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Call CDI in forest

421
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
Breastplate

422
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,304
Misrepresentation of the misunderstanding

423
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Then I would seem to be having is

424
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
Is the leader of the hero

425
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:48,288
No he's the villain he's literally the entire point of the book

426
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
He's a complicated villain much like Rorschach is a complicated hero

427
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
There is no

428
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
The book

429
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
He is the leader of the heroes

430
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Like he is somehow a he's not

431
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,256
In the in the graphic novel that you skim

432
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Ozymandias is present

433
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
It is a much more cumin

434
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
Flawed figure where is because I think the ACT

435
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
So terrible

436
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
Did Matthew Goode

437
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
It was able to get those note

438
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
And

439
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,616
In the movie by cutting out the entire part about the dark freighter

440
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
You lose a lot of them

441
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Contacts

442
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,480
4 oz mandisa's character

443
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
The humanity of

444
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Being

445
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
At the Villa

446
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
A sacrificial Ville

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
I don't know

448
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
Extraordinary Gentlemen

449
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
Some of his stuff I worked at a movie theater in high school movies came out

450
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,296
Encephalitis are Killing Joke is really good 12

451
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
He does a really good job of like crap

452
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Complicated

453
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
Stories as opposed to

454
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,256
Hero Stories that may be good and bad

455
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
There's blurring of lines

456
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
I'm serious

457
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,848
I never read that, from hell I never read the comics

458
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
Did you watch the movies

459
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
I know I watch V for Vendetta

460
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Might have watched

461
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
Cuz that came out when I worked at the theater

462
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
They don't have a

463
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,856
Catalog

464
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Stephen Fry

465
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Absolutely

466
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Killed it and beer

467
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Yeah everybody else you know you you win or lose somebody

468
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
I don't like that movie

469
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
It's just

470
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
It's like an aesthetic masquerading as a movie

471
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
What I watch watch

472
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
I didn't think it was terrible

473
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Like when I watch the movie I thought like

474
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,456
I I did I really didn't like how

475
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
People like the comedian

476
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,320
Superhuman strength

477
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
Guys and stuff

478
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,720
Didn't like how knightowl was presented as like

479
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Contradict

480
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
I really hated that guy I liked

481
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,752
Wilson literally everything

482
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
It's not like a boy

483
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Yeah

484
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,408
I think there were a lot of problems with the movie but I still had a positive

485
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Experience

486
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:39,040
Like it got me a little bit

487
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,856
Perfectly cast

488
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
Who played dr. Manhattan

489
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Yeah Billy crudup

490
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
Salvageable

491
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
It's not

492
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
That's good

493
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,568
Also crushed it in Princess Mononoke

494
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
I don't care

495
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,248
I'm not embarrassed

496
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
Memory from Pieology

497
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
X

498
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Times it's been stolen

499
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,584
I went to somebody and never come back

500
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
House burned down a lot

501
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Copies

502
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,776
Been stolen from me and then I wouldn't have worked out

503
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
Amor does great work but

504
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,432
Crazy massive misunderstanding of the text

505
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
To think that Asia mandamus

506
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Is Bagheera

507
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
You could

508
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,440
You can make we had back-to-back great

509
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:57,376
Davis

510
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
You can make an argument that Ozymandias was trying to like resent himself

511
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
And position himself

512
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Leader of all these do

513
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,944
He wasn't the leader of the heroes

514
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
You wouldn't even l

515
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
I think because

516
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
He wins in the end that's why Alex

517
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Maybe

518
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Cuz he just

519
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Assumes that the

520
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
The hero wins

521
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,768
Which is which is another.

522
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Looks looks

523
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
He has a any more to say about that

524
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Glaring

525
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
What kind of depth

526
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Text Jeff

527
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
He is so dumb

528
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,272
Illuminati New World Order

529
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,696
To let the public know what they're planning

530
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,304
Magical powers

531
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
What they're doing how they operate

532
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,288
In all fairness to Allenmore

533
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,616
In His official

534
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,688
But he himself

535
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,248
And promote Illuminati

536
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,136
They reveal the Illuminati

537
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,232
And what

538
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Trailer

539
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Play the trailer

540
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Which is Grace

541
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Of course

542
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
Play the trailer for an audio medium radio show

543
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,896
Slow down version headlights

544
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
Sound effects coming out of the water

545
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Message will look up to me and say help

546
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
And I will say

547
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
No

548
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
Smashing Pumpkins

549
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Concept

550
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Like that is just

551
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
You keep saying that Alan Moore is amazed

552
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
I don't know if that's true

553
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
Care

554
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Books about the Masons

555
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,576
And I'm not going to watch the rest of it

556
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
So cute

557
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
That's a great conspiracy

558
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,096
TV review I love that anytime there's a anytime

559
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,168
The Templars are the ones who are real

560
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
You are

561
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,336
I don't I do not like the idea of it being so much

562
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Anti-woman

563
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,480
And no it allowed all that stuff yet

564
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
This documentary

565
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Heretofore unknown

566
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
Believable access

567
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,024
To the temple the the Masonic temple in London

568
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
Yeah I would just like the biggest

569
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
If they are f****** straight-up dorks

570
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
They're all dorks

571
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
Who are really into ritual

572
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
And they show them

573
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Rehearse

574
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,736
Doing a dress rehearsal of the ritual the Grand Master of the lodge

575
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,112
You got the script of the ritual and he's like looking over it while the new acolyte is

576
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
Like rehearsal

577
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
These are Peter Tork

578
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,328
Turn up my friend

579
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
7 or 8

580
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
His dad was a mason

581
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
Memory of the Masonic

582
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Temple

583
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
There was a magic the Gathering

584
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,760
I lost my friend

585
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,320
One he's really really good at these people getting

586
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,416
Together for the most part to have a Social Club into do these little mini plays

587
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Give you that same charge

588
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,608
That you might have if you did plays there's a real thrill today and then also

589
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Baptist

590
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,520
Directions to regalia of the aprons and out about everybody loves them

591
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
It's so fun

592
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Talk about a bunch is the idea of

593
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
The reason that the stonemason routes

594
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
What they do

595
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Try and help people

596
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Become better

597
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Through the metaphor of build

598
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,160
But the idea of building a house you put a breakdown

599
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Another brick

600
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Put another breakdown eventually you got a good house

601
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,560
That's the way you feel is one of those bricks

602
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Sure that's the way you can live your life

603
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,216
You can make yourself a better life by laying brick after brick after brick

604
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
It's not it it doesn't

605
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Filas

606
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
If you do that that's

607
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
The great wisdom

608
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
So anyway

609
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,456
Really invested in

610
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
I don't particularly care about that

611
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Watchmen

612
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Alan Alan Moore

613
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
Are you

614
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Exactly

615
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
Any number of things he could have pulled

616
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
Then they already pulled exactly the wrong song

617
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
Bright

618
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,136
So Oliver has made me the best

619
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,072
Quicksilver like what you have here is you have a guy

620
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,632
Characters Ozzy mandamus

621
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,472
Ability to understand

622
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,800
Prince to a poem about the hubris of rulers

623
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Their temples crumble

624
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
And s*** like that

625
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Wink

626
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
What do you remember Neil Gaiman

627
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
Illuminati

628
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Talkin about

629
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
No clue

630
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
It's crazy

631
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Going to talk more about how we going

632
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
View the film.

633
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
That much just talked about

634
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:31,104
Important

635
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Watchmen

636
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Reviewers

637
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
Yeah.

638
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,096
These are the superheroes

639
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Stop

640
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Alright

641
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
Goodwill

642
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
Grassy knoll

643
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Warshak

644
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:25,888
And we'll break

645
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
Their plans to the public

646
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,944
Think about that for a little while but Alex before you understand any of this

647
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
You need to realize

648
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
This is a fictional universe

649
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:49,696
Big Blue Magic Man

650
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,024
Life imitates art that has

651
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
Here's the other problem

652
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
The false flag

653
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Stop and all that

654
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
In the book

655
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
The movie presumed

656
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
Universe

657
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Where there is going

658
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
To be a nuclear war

659
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,944
Is awful

660
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
And horrific and it's why he's the villain

661
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
But

662
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
In that universe

663
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
It worked

664
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
There was going to be a nuclear war

665
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Vig

666
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Dear

667
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
Essentially like

668
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
Would you

669
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
Pull the lever

670
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,872
Alright you got one person on the train you got five people over there

671
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
People and kill one person

672
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Right

673
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,576
Apple watch

674
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
All of the narrative

675
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Flourishes

676
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Characters

677
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Is utilitarianism

678
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
That's all it is

679
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
No

680
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
You killed because

681
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,592
But he is incapable of stopping

682
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
Irregardless

683
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Flight differ

684
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,784
Will

685
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
Which kind of suspect

686
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,488
Yes that is the thing that's going to wear deals which is the entire

687
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,376
I have to not do that destroyed

688
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
To his own destruction

689
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Which is

690
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
I don't know man

691
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,480
I love you and Alex gets into literature

692
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
I love it

693
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,880
We have one more clip of him breaking down the Watchmen

694
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Because he doesn't really get into too much

695
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,488
Wait I thought you were only doing

696
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
We are

697
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
Bigfoot

698
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,520
XSport

699
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
The thing is that he doesn't really

700
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:21,760
He plays the trailer at is it the Illuminati Bible

701
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
It's going to break coming back and being like

702
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,880
Number one movie at the Box

703
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,512
Quite frankly America

704
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
And then

705
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Related to other things

706
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,704
TV show The X-Files spin-off the lone gunmen

707
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
And play the clip from that where it's at

708
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Things to talk about

709
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Aldine HAC

710
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
I was on his show and said that

711
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
At the CIA

712
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
911 plot

713
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Coronavirus

714
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
I think Alex just like

715
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,904
Anybody who describes himself as a lone gunman

716
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Regardless of

717
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
X-Files Network

718
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,472
Don't know if it holds up stranger

719
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
Watched

720
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
Just cuz

721
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Not one of my things

722
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
The X-Files

723
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
I feel like it's too late

724
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
Enjoy.

725
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Netflix

726
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Kind of thing

727
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Safety companies

728
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
A lot of fun Gillian Anderson

729
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
I love them both

730
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:45,216
Yeah that one was really good

731
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
She was great in American Gods

732
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
All this is to say that his analysis

733
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
It doesn't

734
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
But this next clip

735
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:04,927
I think really sums up to the first misunderstanding I believe is that Ozymandias is a good guy

736
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
I thought it was his name was Ozzy mandamus

737
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,631
The double prong misunderstanding

738
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
What's true

739
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
That is the first like

740
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,055
Essential misunderstanding

741
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,127
Bring

742
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Send me related

743
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
Nicole misunderstanding

744
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
The wound in the earth that looks identical to the mall out of World Trade Center

745
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,095
American flag

746
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
And he says to

747
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:54,079
Doctor Manhattan

748
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:59,967
Twin brother God

749
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,319
This stop

750
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
Now the Soviets in the United States

751
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
And

752
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
The bad guy Rorschach

753
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
And

754
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
Doctor Manhattan children

755
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
B****

756
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
And that is the message the world is saved

757
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
And Lucifer

758
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,631
Man is going to travel the stars as a universe

759
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
Earth has been saved

760
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
The band

761
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Has been killed

762
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,687
Warshak who's against child molestation against

763
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,039
Police brutality

764
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,111
Because

765
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135
Has been defeated

766
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,695
Alex thinks he's Rorschach

767
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,511
Wow you really does think he's very shy

768
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
Alex

769
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,399
Deeply identifies with Roche

770
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Verb

771
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
BB comics in history

772
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
You really onto his own deck

773
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
That that Rorschach

774
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Character

775
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Yeah I know

776
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
You could fight his way out of

777
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,231
A prison cell

778
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Alex

779
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,583
More with the like

780
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
You think I'm in here with you

781
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
You are in here with

782
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
I mean there's no other way

783
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Entire thing

784
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
It's based on the misunderstanding of

785
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Alignment

786
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,735
First of all good vs Evil

787
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,551
Alex

788
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
You think you're

789
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Hindi story

790
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
You think you're the best

791
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,071
This speaks volumes about your psychology

792
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Ostensibly

793
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,471
The character you most identify with is presented as a couple

794
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Navigate to gyro

795
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
You still find a way to be the victim

796
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Fascinating

797
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Fascinating

798
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Some sort of

799
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Paranoid

800
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,295
No.

801
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,647
Through so many different like different tendrils different ways

802
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
It's fascinating

803
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,047
A movie review can't be done without getting into some sort of

804
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
This is about me

805
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
The globalist

806
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Audrey Mann Davis

807
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,215
And Doctor Manhattan

808
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
The global

809
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,567
Coming together against me Rorschach

810
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
I guess Jason bermas is night owl

811
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,551
I don't know who else is around Arab do is this the funny

812
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Take me to work

813
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
It goes to Commercial and comes back

814
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Linda Rob Jacobs

815
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Comes in

816
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Studio talk about Watchmen

817
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
Yeah

818
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
There's no extra analysis really

819
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,095
But you can tell

820
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,727
Rob comes in

821
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Hiroshima

822
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
Uses to say Ozymandias his name because he knows without you

823
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Keepsake

824
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,183
He'll know that guy

825
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Call man

826
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Advance

827
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
To the end of the watch

828
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
Portion of the show

829
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,311
Affiliated familiarity with Motrin

830
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Absolutely

831
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
That is

832
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
He gets everything so wrong

833
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
And if you want to stay

834
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
To get everything

835
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,023
Because the Watchman has a lot of themes that

836
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
Everybody can really kind of

837
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Understand no matter what

838
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,447
Like even if you're even if you don't agree with like the overarching themes or anything

839
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
You can find one or two like

840
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Why does

841
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,543
Alex just go like

842
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
That character the comedian he really knew what the f*** was up you know like that's kind of what he is that's

843
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Region

844
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
You know

845
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
Problems from that character

846
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Exact

847
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Play Alex

848
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Fair enough

849
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Move along I don't think you got to the bottom of anything

850
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,583
You never say what you wanted to say all done in like 5 minutes

851
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
They are bad

852
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
They made a movie trying to say I'm bad

853
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
It was all about me

854
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
How does the movie

855
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:18,943
What did dr. Manhattan blame for the attack on New York

856
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,503
There's a doctor Manhattan Society

857
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:26,879
She's going to live in the stars or whatever and then he realizes he has to be the bad guy

858
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,207
Psychics

859
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Becomes into

860
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Manhattan

861
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,327
Manhattan

862
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
The better end

863
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,983
I think the movie is worse than

864
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
But I think the

865
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
Because in the movie

866
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
Manhattan is Blaine

867
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
At the end then what that really

868
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
He says there's that

869
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
Is the ultimate

870
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
In order to

871
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,807
Fight in order like

872
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Break yourself

873
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
Constant cycle of violence

874
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Interesting perhaps

875
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,231
Perhaps because what is Doctor Manhattan other than

876
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
A physical

877
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Sure

878
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,423
He also says with the symbol on his head is like a illuminati but it's

879
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
Yeah I know it's just a regular atom

880
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
Like

881
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,567
If an atom is the symbol of

882
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
The Illuminati

883
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
That kind of

884
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
Everybody

885
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
Yep fun talking about this

886
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
It's always fun

887
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
Whenever Alex

888
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Can actually enjoy

889
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
It's kind of fun

890
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,743
Impossibly bad reader

891
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279
Interpreter

892
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,607
Fascinating to me the level of missing the point

893
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
I don't know

894
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
You've got a

895
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
If you ate

896
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
Freshman

897
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
High school list

898
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Kind of

899
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
Ability to understand

900
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,783
Subway

901
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Has all of this

902
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Pent-up

903
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Rage and inability to

904
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Process

905
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,767
But if you if you live like if your

906
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,351
If you're reviewing a piece of narrative fiction

907
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Yeah

908
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
It behooves you

909
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
Predictive programming

910
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:19,007
It behooves you to live within the parameters that that Universe set

911
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
Because otherwise

912
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
Is the story of differ

913
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,895
There if you try and stay

914
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Real

915
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
And like

916
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
121 applicable

917
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
To real life

918
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
You're you're depriving

919
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
Work of its content

920
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,999
Depriving

921
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,311
When you're supposed to be specially respect

922
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Superheroes

923
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Ennard X scream

924
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,943
Or whatever like

925
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Alex

926
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Alex

So here you stupid again he has another Gaston

No longer

930
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Cs50

931
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,695
To just talk to his

00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
Water filter sponsor

933
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Here's another guy

934
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:25,567
Hjm 17 in Oregon declared 10th Amendment

935
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:31,967
Sovereignty

936
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
To my friend

937
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
Couldn't you just like

938
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
We missed it

939
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,975
We missed he is a little short about

940
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
Looked into

941
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
Representative

942
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Denison

Dennis Richard

944
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Interviews

945

10th Amendment resolutions

946
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,551
Reasons that are just there to hide the fact that were angry that the Press

947
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
Dennis Richardson

948
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,719
2007's from the House of Representatives

949
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:19,071
More likely to abuse children

950
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,399
Statistics

951
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,799
Being different than normal marriage during Portland are more likely to

952
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
Abused boys

953
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,871
Also in April

954
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,151
2007

955
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,687
He sent out an email that started

956
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,759
Exhaust leak has been like no other

957
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
On Monday the world witnessed

958
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
The tragedy at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg Virginia

959
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
On Tuesday Oregon

960
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
The passage of domestic

961
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
Sick benefits for same-sex

962
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
But the fundraising email

963
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:02,847
Of course that's the way he's bringing fix though it's a tragedy that has befallen us

964
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
Call Tom

965
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
These Pilots

966
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
It's just to say

967
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,087
Hey man all of these dudes

968
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
They all are either racist

969
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,487
Stuck in a

970
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
Very white

971
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
Good portion of History

972
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
Interesting

973
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
It is like

974
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
Statistically

975
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
Impossible

976
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,823
All of the people Alex would have on

977
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Habitat

978
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,431
A random sample set

979
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
Even people who are

980
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
Possible

981
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
Have bigotry in there

982
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:50,207
Yeah I might have gone down the wrong Panther

983
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
The fun thing

984
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
About Obama being

985
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Is that

986
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,631
It gave all of those

987
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Rite-Way

988
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Racist

989
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,519
You know you and I would call Republic

990
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Like

991
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,103
A common Boogeyman

992
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Their other hatred

993
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Kids at Bay

994
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,503
You know

995
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
President

996
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,671
Navigate to go towards everybody like immigrants

997
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,487
Like they're just shooting hate left and right

998
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
So many teenagers master

999
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
It's smoke them out of their holes

1000
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
This is also can be frustrating

1001
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,495
Miraculous

1002
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,799
They're all the same

1003
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
This is a very weird way that Alex

1004
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
Comes back from break in the middle of the show

1005
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
The world's population

1006
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
Add more than half the world's wealth

1007
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,519
Why in the world

1008
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:13,919
Perfect

1009
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:20,319
Conquer the world

1010
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Country

1011
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,095
South Africa's got roughly twice

1012
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,167
What is a squall

1013
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
Wonder why I wonder why

1014
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
A version of history that

1015
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
On par with your understanding of Watchman in terms of accuracy

1016
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,487
100 bullets

1017
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,583
The idea that it's so

1018
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,911
We just play along with

1019
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:11,263
The Sandman that we used to have half of the world's wealth but it's all been stolen

1020
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
So crazy

1021
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Wait is that what he said

1022
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
Because I thought you meant

1023
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
We have half the world's wealth

1024
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
Because we stole it

1025
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:31,743
Since the time we used to have it is all been stolen from us

1026
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,071
Sure doesn't

1027
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,863
Rate

1028
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,935
I'm pretty sure

1029
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Had a good run

1030
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
Now we come to

1031
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
The last guest of

1032
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
The Alex has

1033
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,415
He's done his he's said his piece he's giving his breakdown as Watchmen

1034
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:07,071
They want to plug things I got to bring content absolutely table or you live

1035
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
Elvis is totally cool

1036
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
And now we get to this last

1037
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
Yes I'm of the last guest

1038
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
Just from a guess

1039
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Compton

1040
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
I don't know why

1041
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,615
Danny Bonaduce is he going to have Danny Bonaduce

1042
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,687
I don't know if he's ever been on

1043
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,271
And who years it was important

1044
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:34,207
Greg pound does great work at free our kids.com and free our children

1045
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,631
Everything is always told me turn out to be documented

1046
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,103
I want to talk about that

1047
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,503
From

1048
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,391
Tony Alamo Alamo Ministries not familiar without David persecuted

1049
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,975
I'm even closer to ship me the news Clemson articles for about a year

1050
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
So Tony Alamo is being persecuted we got the

1051
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,151
Is Greg pound coming on to talk about it

1052
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,711
Let's see where he goes with his why is this

1053
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,831
Greg

1054
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,159
There's always so much going on because you have

1055
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:42,559
Lost her sheep

1056
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
That your wife had another baby she's in hiding so they can't get the baby out

1057
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
Producer

1058
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,247
But the thing is is is Alamo ministries.com

1059
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,903
Is basically I mean they do the starting and we know as parents at these these immunizations

1060
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,303
Start the best thing for children

1061
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,191
When there's no rules Charlie Sheen children

1062
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,055
Because he doesn't vaccinate

1063
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,359
I want to vaccinate the children

1064
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
Alama Alama

1065
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
That I guess that

1066
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
What's the narrative I mean

1067
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,135
You know you do have a right to put your children in danger that way I guess if the parents decide

1068
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
I don't know I mean it

1069
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:46,815
Sure I mean look how is that is that the story where we're going to be going with

1070
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,863
I mean I don't resist going to change

1071
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,423
Well I mean

1072
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,871
Some parents spank already

1073
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,711
Lake-Link

1074
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Angela

1075
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
One of the things is

1076
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,623
If they they did say that they had

1077
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,927
Rain scheduled and it was up parents

1078
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
Thanking their children nothing

1079
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Children

1080
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
Because Tony Alamos

1081
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
Not vaccinating and then there's

1082
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:35,455
Family members were in

1083
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,087
Buying or though you know I mean this guy

1084
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,391
Clearly persecuted by the hour

1085
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,231
There's no

1086
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:52,863
Hey Giorno to tell you a little bit about Tony Alamo

1087
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
Born in 1934 Hoffman

1088
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:07,967
Tony Alamo and his wife in mission for God in 1969

1089
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,551
They formed Alamo Christian Ministries and set out to build a congregate

1090
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,903
If there's anything I know about people who form their Ministry 1969

1091
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,463
No Sinister element that all

1092
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:23,839
They did so they built their church and preaching to the deaf

1093
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
Drug-addicted promising

1094
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
Them food and shelter at their Church

1095
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,727
Of course their church was located in rural cross

1096
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Four County

1097
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,287
So once the folks got out there

1098
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,359
Did realize they're kind of stuck in off and decided to stay

1099
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,503
And ended up working for one of the lawn mowers business is already is farm for no pay other than room and board

1100
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,807
Right now

1101
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,647
But in this case Tony elamo demands that anyone who joins

1102
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:53,279
The church takes for them to be a member of his church and simultaneously taking

1103
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:59,679
Valerie is really just cutting out the middle step of them having to give it back to the church after he's done

1104
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Jesus

1105
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
4 years

1106
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,407
Basic exploitative religious

1107
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
Bass community

1108
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,247
Advantage of the people

1109
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Also offering them drugs

1110
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Treatment Services

1111
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Here to be some good work

1112
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
You know it

1113
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,679
His wife Susan

1114
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,727
Tony went up

1115
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,335
So this is f****** Heaven's Gate situation

1116
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
For six months

1117
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:44,223
She kept Susan's body on display in their church because he believed that he was capable of bringing her back to life

1118
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,087
All right that's not good according to Alicia Frank Alamo compound at the age of

1119
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
215

1120
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:54,719
She and other compound children were told if they prayed hard enough Alamos wife Susan

1121
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,303
Who died from cancer after the compound move to Arkansas would rise from the dead

1122
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
Each day she did not awake

1123
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
The children were feet

1124
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
For everyday

1125
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
Go

1126
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
That does not mean to Tony was

1127
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
Total lunatic cult leader

1128
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
Before then

1129
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,223
Tony

1130
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Stripping them of their

1131
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,063
I told OregonLive

1132
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,879
You slept on the floor in a sister's room

1133
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,903
You didn't have a bed

1134
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
A few of the chosen ones had beds

1135
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
You didn't

1136
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,047
Who controlled relied on an Insidious level of social shaming

1137
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
The cat people in line

1138
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,143
Again from Diane Bach

1139
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Call

1140
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
They were told what to wear what to say

1141
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,007
To think all meals were served in

1142
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
In the cafeteria with no choice

1143
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,871
She said that anyone could be publicly rebuked without warning

1144
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,407
And most of the followers lived in

1145
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
In constant fear

1146
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,503
One day box said she petted a llama on the ground

1147
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,551
Soon an announcement came over the

1148
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
Speaker during a church service

1149
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
Susan Del Amo

1150
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,695
Who said there was quote something mentally wrong with Bach for petting the llama

1151
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,487
That was the message

1152
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
There was no explanation

1153
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
The rest of the prayer meeting was a blur

1154
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,655
The rebuke meant that others in the compound refused to interact with

1155
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
In any fashion with Bach for several months

1156
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
Brand-new behavior for a

1157
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,663
Naturally Tony got more abusive

1158
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,783
In September to September 2008 Federal

1159
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,903
No it September 2008 federal and state police raided a lamos compound after receiving some

1160
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Complaints

1161
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,743
Investigation

1162
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:37,375
Remember the Alamo accused of physically and sexually abusing children

1163
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,727
And when asked

1164
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
The same reason Jesus's living

1165
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,103
When the dust settled Alana was arrested and convicted

1166
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
10 counts in a Federal indictment accusing

1167
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,223
Transporting minors across state lines for the purpose of sex

1168
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,783
He received 175 years in prison

1169
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
Guy behind bars

1170
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Somehow not long enough

1171
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Now

1172
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,207
Put his body on display for six months

1173
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:06,047
Beat anybody near him praise doesn't come back

1174
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
The stories that came out in the investigation

1175
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
The trial of the sickest

1176
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Of the sword

1177
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,679
You always hear about call later

1178
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
Tony Lama was running an abuse fact

1179
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Bringing young girls

1180
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
Of 8 and 6

1181
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Make them as brides

1182
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,991
His attorney appealed for Mercy ask Court consider a lamos goodworks to which one of his victims

1183
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,087
Do number two said I can't believe you have the audacity to ask for mercy

1184
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
What Mercy did you ever show up

1185
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,159
One day less

1186
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,511
Or 139 strikes as a board instead of 140

1187
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,583
Did you ever once have mercy on an eight-year-old body

1188
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
Quote from trial

1189
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
One of his victim

1190
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:47,007
Google call Harry Barnes was not interest

1191
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Branson elaenia

1192
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
And he said quote

1193
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,407
This court believes you should be incarcerated in federal prison for the rest of your natural life

1194
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,991
Someday you'll meet a judge with higher authority than me may have mercy on

1195
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Your soul

1196
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,343
Earlier this year in 2018 two of Allah most child Brides

1197
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,879
It's came forward to share their stories

1198
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
It's as bad as you would

1199
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Amy Eddie was 14

1200
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
She was forced to marry

1201
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,535
Pebbles Rodriguez with 12

1202
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:14,143
They lived as brides for around a decade and we're regularly beat and starved and raped

1203
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:19,263
Describe her time in the called quote I was terrified that if I didn't do what I was supposed

1204
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,079
To do what you told me to do it no matter what it was

1205
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
I'm going to

1206
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,711
Amy and Pebbles were two of the young girls were free during the 2008 raid

1207
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
Which Alex and his guests here on this show are trying to percent to some

1208
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
The government,

1209
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Stealing innocent

1210
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
Children

1211
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Because they refused to

1212
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
Get back scene

1213
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,231
Or respect by their parents

1214
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
The way

1215
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Presenting

1216
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Serial child

1217
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,423
At somebody who's likely

1218
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Almost

1219
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Alex

1220
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Care about the

1221
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,455
Now here's where here's where things get real messy

1222
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Alex

1223
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,551
Repeatedly already in the s*** that we've listened to

1224
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
I said he's

1225
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
A year to look into this

1226
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
He's claiming that if

1227
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
If you'd looked into it at all key would find

1228
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Liquor

1229
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,375
Video the arrest in the raid was

1230
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
2008

1231
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
We're in 2009

1232
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:23,263
We're in March 2009 you're a lot of this information has come out

1233
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
He's not setting

1234
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Until September

1235
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,455
And the children were taken out

1236
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
F****** wrecked

1237
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,319
These are people like if you listen to Amy and Pebbles there

1238
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
Telling of it

1239
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,135
It was a being spayed

1240
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:43,743
If you listen to hear the accounts from other even adult members of

1241
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
Of the church

1242
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
To escape

1243
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
It's the sort of thing that is last

1244
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
The rest of their lives

1245
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
They're like 50 year old people who still

1246
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
Can't make choices

1247
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
Because of the brainwashing

1248
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,543
In the abuse that they stopped

1249
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,615
They all this church was about

1250
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,175
It was about him stealing all of their money

1251
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:07,039
Mentally f****** over it abusing all of these people of child bride

1252
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,855
Totally f***** up

1253
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,647

Just know like you're not a member

1262

Hope the human race goodbye and if you're a truth-teller if you're someone who's doing the radio show where you prefer to have

Trial

1279
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,863
Across the street a cheetah makes

1280
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
Shred

1281
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,215
You reap what you sow. No mercy

1282
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Mixed

1283
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Three children ages

1284
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
4 5 and 6

1285
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,335
City of John and Jennifer

1286
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
Colbeck

1287
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
Fugitive is wanted for allegedly

1288
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
Beating kids and adults

1289
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
He

1290
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,527
One of the former members of

1291
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,343
The church kidnapped three of this lady's children

1292
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
She's not feeding them send

1293
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
He's a fugitive on the Run

1294
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
So Alex is entire

1295
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,023
Story that he's telling about the idea

1296
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
The government came

1297
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,095
A kidnap to be people's children

1298
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:00,703
When they were rescuing child Brides of a cult leader it actually

1299
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,287
When you dig a little bit deeper into the story you find it that cult

1300
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
Did kidnap people's children

1301
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,663
He's on the exact wrong side of this

1302
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
No no

1303
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,575
I don't have it I don't have a follow-up on that I'm sorry I just that.

01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
I hope he's good

1305
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159

Can we get a posse together what you need to do if you need to go out in public

1309
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:35,007
You need to go out in public with a big boombox like your radio Raheem and just play beer for my horse

1310
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
Play Willie Nelson

I just don't understand

1328
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:41,823
Like isn't that why we're so fascinated

1329
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,615
What would happen

1330
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,199
That broke a human bring to the point where now it is

1331
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
Completely divorce

1332
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,271
From any concept of

1333
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Empathy

1334
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
Or even simply

1335
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
Just just

1336
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Non exist

1337
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,207
Just a few or creature

1338
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
I don't understand it

1339
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,863
No it's even more f***** up is I don't think that's

1340
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
The fairest

1341
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
What hours is doing

1342
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,751
May I really don't I don't think at the end of this episode him

1343
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
To this guy

1344
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,847
Accidentally

1345
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
Personally endorse Antonio

1346
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
He's acting himself

1347
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,735
I think he's trying to

1348
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
Cover his lack of

1349
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,599
I think he's trying to spackle over how stupid

1350
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,415
By pretending that he knows about this

1351
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
Actual case

1352
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
Yeah he doesn't know s*** about

1353
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,559
If he actually did know anything about it he would

1354
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
Absolutely not be on board

1355
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
I don't know

1356
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,751
You know what I want to I want to say I want to believe you

1357
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,823
I genuinely do I want to believe that

1358
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:50,431
That what you're saying makes sense but the more we learn about Alex

1359
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
He'll defend anybody who

1360
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:59,903
Who like I can't exist outside of what those liberals want you to believe even if that includes

1361
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,927
Food ratings

1362
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,743
I find it so impossible

1363
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,303
To believe that

1364
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,351
Would be something that you would be okay with

1365
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Like

1366
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Just my my feeling that there's that

1367
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,335
But I might be wrong too

1368
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:19,871
I don't know

1369
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
I think it's more likely that he's just

1370
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Stupid

1371
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Expect

1372
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:28,575
Talk about just vaccine bowl-shaped

1373
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367
Can't show apps on air

1374
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,951
Or just be like

1375
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,023
Let's read book I have more thoughts about Asia Matt Damon

1376
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,327
Yeah it go with that

1377
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,887
I don't get the head off

1378
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
That yeah

1379
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
I think he's I think it's probably

1380
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,239
Mostly pasta

1381
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
I think

1382
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,823
But that might be the most optimistic

1383
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,199
We now know about once again the stupid

1384
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
Evil continuum

1385
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
Comes

1386
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Mexico

1387
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
This Greg pound guy at

1388
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,207
Part of the alarm

1389
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:13,119
So this guy is actually in the game on tomorrow

1390
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,935
I can't say 100% That Bass

1391
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,007
Hopefully this will let you see what I mean

1392
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,335
The way he's praising things there's a lot of inclusive language

1393
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
20 talks about

1394
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,943
The group which led never directly says I'm part of this group

1395
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
But it is

1396
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
Fuels like

1397
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
He's expressing

1398
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Communion

1399
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,183
I want to thank you for being there because every time I've called you have open

1400
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,999
Your program up in order for us to cry out as parent

1401
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,655
I haven't seen my kids now for over a year this is going on for four years for three years we could only see him one hour a month you should know

1402
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,287
I'm ministries.com in look at they put under website

1403
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,431
Did the stipulations when they go to visit their kids what they can and can't say that can't whisper to their children

1404
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:04,831
If this is what they doing your isolating the parents in the children and if they destroy our family we have no Nation

1405
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:13,279
Christians everywhere protect religious persecution

1406
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,583
So I don't know what to do with this Greg

1407
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,191
But I don't know what to do with a box to put him in

1408
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:24,799
In terms of him being like a facilitator between or

1409
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
Actually

1410
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,919
I'll tell you what

1411
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,503
I can't find any information about great pound on the in

1412
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
Who is the guy i k

1413
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,391
I probably was born

1414
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
What

1415
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
Bernie

1416
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,463
Whatever

1417
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,791
Yeah so

1418
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,839
I think that he should have started the end of

1419
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
With this and then

1420
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,191
Continue the interview ever

1421
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
And also not

1422
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
Brag you know a lot of times

1423
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,127
When you call a

1424
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,967
Come on I specifically know

1425
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:10,367
Everything going to be covering the Alamo Ministries recap anything else you

1426
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,159
Well if

1427
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:16,511
Alamo ministries.com and if you just go there in 30 this ministry

1428
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,303
It's hard to believe that they can take

1429
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,887
37 children are there then have a pickup order 420 more

1430
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
Snot

1431
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,727
Very gracious

1432
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,543
The best I could do for the

1433
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Pore sucker

1434
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Kids

1435
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,271
When you come on you got to let me know what we're going to talk

1436
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
Hey that's good

1437
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,415
Should go with that go with that

1438
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,255
Admitting that you don't know what you're talkin about don't allow this guy

1439
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,303
Alamo Ministry

1440
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:54,399
Don't do that you don't know what you're letting this guy plug

1441
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
And then Alex says

1442
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,063
Greg bring you up

1443
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,951
Get like an hour and a half with you and Pastor Tony Alamo

1444
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:33,055
Almost everything

1445
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,847
Map

1446
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:39,711
You know I guess you talked to Pastor Aleman

1447
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,783
Alex the church is like a sleeping giant

1448
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,927
And if the church doesn't wake up in America I mean if you could tap into the church and get the church woken up

1449
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:55,327
I mean I mean this battle Beyond

1450
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,887
Yeah that doesn't work that that sure

1451
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
Are we

1452
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Nope

1453
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,895
I mean that speaks for itself man that's the that's the

1454
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Disgraceful

1455
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
Awful

1456
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
I don't know what else

1457
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,759
To say other than Alex

1458
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,831
Through whether intentional or

1459
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
Stupidity is

1460
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
Running a propaganda PR front

1461
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,023
The guy who marries kid

1462
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,983
Well you could always go visiting with a f******

1463
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
Macron

1464
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
Bran

1465
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
Yep

1466
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,895
Price I know that's a real bummer deflating

1467
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
Episode.

1468
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:50,879
This is why the show is still like this is why the show in 2009

1469
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
For me is so

1470
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,719
Interesting as opposed to in the present

1471
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,303
In the present were seeing the self-destruction of

1472
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,607
I do think it's kind of dangerous

1473
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,167
It's not really fun it's harder to laugh

1474
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,215
It's too hard to laugh at him

1475
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
Promoting

1476
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
A sex cult

1477
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
Abusing children

1478
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:13,663
Define abusing children

1479
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
Agree

1480
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,735
Any kind of swinging sex called

1481
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,671
This is a fascinating show

1482
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,719
Article archaeological

1483
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,767
Anthropological

1484
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,559
Looking back at this this isn't

1485
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
Fascinating the way you can

1486
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
Set out to

1487
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,911
Deconstruct watch

1488
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Get everything wrong

1489
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,775
Come up with a bunch of other b******* along the way

1490
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,823
Try and sell some water filters

1491
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,151
I meant tumble like mr. Magoo ass backwards

1492
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Dorsey

1493
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,479
A child rapist

1494
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,271
Ostensibly most again

1495
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,063
This is a fascinating

1496
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
I don't I don't know how

1497
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
I mean that

1498
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
That is

1499
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,767
It is interesting

1500
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,071
To watch him be wrong about

1501
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Everything

1502
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Always

1503
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:09,471
Like this episode is maybe the most

1504
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Wrong

1505
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
He's been for a

1506
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,616
Contiguous. Of time with no root

1507
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
Do you mean

1508
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
One month

1509
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:26,112
Yep you know what you're not wrong about that why you're not wrong about it is wrong but you're not wrong about it

1510
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,904
And then what

1511
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,696
He's an unrepentant

1512
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:34,304
Ignorant bastard so fun because it's different kinds of

1513
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
It's like he's trying to bat for the cycle

1514
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,936
Within an episode

1515
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:45,568
Single double triple a homerun over wrong it's crazy

1516
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Hertz

1517
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
It hurts your Humanity

1518
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
This sort of thing

1519
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
But at the same time

1520
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Like this

1521
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
From Miami

1522
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,368
I would do this all day

1523
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,792
Has been on

1524
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:11,424
Before but I've not heard it so you haven't been on in 2008/2009 episodes that I look

1525
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,008
Alex was

1526
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
Of Alamo

1527
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
But I don't know

1528
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
For sure of grapes

1529
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
Other.

1530
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Alarm

1531
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,272
I'm convinced

1532
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,112
The emphasis on the 2nd

1533
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Syllable

1534
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,208
But I know

1535
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,352
Alex is also being tricked by his love of Colonel Travis and the Alamo

1536
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:45,728
Tony Romo Tony Alamo

1537
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
So yeah

1538
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,640
Probably talked about more

1539
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,432
Like CPS is taken

1540
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,712
Kids kind of narrative

1541
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:00,320
Vaccines are being forced on people more germane to Alex

1542
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
His bread-and-butter

1543
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Where's this

1544
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:09,536
Find me the way that Alex that even in that clip like you got to let me know we can talk about ahead of time

1545
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,072
Stephen of departure a little bit

1546
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:16,704
From what that you would usually talk a little bit uncomfortable

1547
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
But not

1548
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,520
I think the uncomfortableness is

1549
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,568
Arrangement taken up

1550
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
He's slightly out of his death

1551
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,408
With authority about

1552
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,736
Obama Ministry

1553
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
Right you can't bring up like

1554
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
Documents

1555
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Passive

1556
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
Is out of position

1557
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
Poker

1558
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
Terminology

1559
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
You know it's just

1560
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
It's weird to

1561
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,544
It's weird and it's super weird on this level

1562
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,592
You look at this

1563
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
2009

1564
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,688
He's not playing good defense

1565
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712
But he has the insert

1566
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,528
Yeah you know a little

1567
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
Yeah yeah

1568
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
I don't know it's just

1569
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,464
I don't know what I don't know

1570
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
Cuz I feel like

1571
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,512
I feel like anyting

1572
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,816
I feel like anything I say is to

1573
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,840
You close to like

1574
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,888
Intellectualizing

1575
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
Horror

1576
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
That is the end of the

1577
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,752
I don't want to do that

1578
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,080
That is part of the Fall

1579
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,872
The Detachment of

1580
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,152
10 years old

1581
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,016
If Alex was doing this and present day

1582
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,552
Brave

1583
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
I don't know

1584
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,536
With the years you're like

1585
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:50,400
Well I mean of course he defended a child rapist Lego up what that doesn't make sense at all

1586
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,752
Fresh president Kavanaugh

1587
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
Might as well

1588
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
Cheese's pizza

1589
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Guys man

1590
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Wild

1591
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,784
They're everywhere

1592
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:17,280
Fondant not fun as is the case with all of our episodes

1593
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:23,168
Simultaneously in separate our brand is hilarious

1594
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
No no no no no no

1595
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,520
There's not a lot of shows

1596
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,336
They can go from Ozzy mandamus to

1597
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:37,760
Like

1598
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
Hard to do

1599
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,088
The boys

1600
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:46,720
That was Environmental

01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,656
Our website, they're going to check that out

1602
01:24:54,912 --> 01:25:00,288
Some stuff coming in the future are there places

1603
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,336
Where you could find us that you

1604
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
Could not perhaps

1605
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
Alex Jones

1606
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
Twitter

1607
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,224
You could acknowledge underscore

1608
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,784
Yep Facebook

1609
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,672
You were there

1610
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,232
If you would like

1611
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,792
Sports show to go to website knowledge flights.com

1612
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,840
Put that sport the show but would appreciate it

1613
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,912
I'm sick and tired of telling my blood I'll still do it until like

1614
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448
I don't have to

1615
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
I was in there today and I text

1616
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Did you about this Jordan there was a

1617
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,664
Aggressive conversation going on about the Bill Cosby

1618
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,272
There were two people yelling about how

1619
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Schoolboy

1620
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,600
Abilene

1621
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:52,000
They're never going to lock up Weinstein cuz that guy is a Jew

1622
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,328
Gotta get out of here I can't handle this

1623
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,984
I don't know I don't know if this is a reverse Pez dispenser I don't know what's going on

1624
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,264
The conversation

1625
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
What's going on over there

1626
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,824
Blood Center

1627
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,872
Reviews being a Highwayman

1628
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,688
But

1629
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,136
If you want to support the show you're going to need to because that's the only way we're going to get one

1630
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160
Locked up apparel

1631
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:23,488
Also you know it's hard to say what's worse about Alex

1632
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
Being a public relations

1633
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
Sky Ferreira

1634
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
Childbearing

1635
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
The fact

1636
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,192
So we always need to remind

1637
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,312
Holding

1638
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,944
Alex
