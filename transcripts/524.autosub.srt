Something that we need to put ketchup on

6
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,848

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
Hannah Santos

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Some chocolate

14
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
Erie Pennsylvania the pride of Erie

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Candy

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Romolos

17
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
And what is this other one it's Stephen something-or-other

18
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
Please

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
I haven't had to do that that had to put it

20
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,784
Between two families in Erie that are chocolatiers one

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Makes a chocolate that is deemed

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Quote better than the other

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,952
I want you to do a blind taste test between the two milk chocolate sponge candy

24
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
Until we did that before the show

25
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Chewing into the mic

26
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Discuss

27
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,008
So I we've tried these and which one is the

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
The classier one or two considered

29
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Equalizer 1 and I say it's definitely it is gondolas

30
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Mobile

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Gondola

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Vibrate

33
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Pretty sure I'm right in advance

34
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm not saying that you're not I'm just Airi were talkin about this exactly

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Start a recording as we're eating chocolate

36
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Your reason

37
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
For choosing Rivaldo is almost oppositional defiance

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Local thing it's

39
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Don't know too much about these arrival chocolatiers

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Hatfield

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Koizi

42
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
Sure I just assumed that

43
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
One of them if it's

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
Better it's the less

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
I don't but I don't think it's supposed to say

46
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
Say is not as good I don't think either of them were bad

47
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Don't know they're both delicious

48
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
They were both fine I just think the Romola was a little bit

49
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
The chocolate was a little dry

50
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
A little thicker

51
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Doesn't melt in your

52
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
No absolutely not

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736
Anyway that's my breath button

54
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,464
The rare triple bright spot for the cycle absolutely

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
First things first

56
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,608
Somebody reach out to me sent me an email and they had done a better job of

57
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
Converting my terrible PDF into an Epub and Mobi

58
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
Could ever do

59
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Citgo as he would like to

60
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
The formatting of your book left something to be desired

61
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
It's just like

62
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
He didn't amazing job

63
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Second

64
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
Was going back to my I've been writing about music

65
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256

So I've mostly Taylor Swift

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
But I've been digging through all my old crate

68
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,215
And stuff like that and I finally read listen

69
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Shinto

Broken Social Scene

Beehives or something like that

Manages to be both sonorous

76
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
And breath

77
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Happy at the same time it is

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,927
Okay beautiful and then the third is something that you just gave to me

79
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,863
Physically that comes from the what was mine again

80
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Meriwether

00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
Male been what did I have I don't know it's not my job to remember your pure passive-aggressive

82
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
I just thought you would be offended Enough by them that you

83
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Anyways

84
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759

113
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
The rule is you can't

114
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Start saying Blackjack until 1

115
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,431
Gets out of its traditional

116
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759

121
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Now you don't have to buy

122
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
We'll figure it out as we go along

123
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Anyway we're talkin about inauguration today

124
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Set out to do a marathon

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
All day and part the reason for this is that he was expecting a false flag terrorist attack to happen it not happen

126
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Turner Falls

127
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Pull-A-Part

128
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
The idea that being a marathon naturally pretty quick

129
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
So today we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over the American Journal hosted by Harrison Smith

130
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Some other issues about Harrison Smith

131
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
Then Alex Jones Show

132
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Until Jon rappoport takes over the 4th hour

133
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
Should I was going to also do the war room but by that point

134
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,703
This thing had ground to a halt

135
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
I got I got no interest in this

136
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,359
And the American Journal honestly think was a bit more interesting than I expected it to be

137
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
That we really need to talk about right about this

138
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
F******

139
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Comparison

140
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
Also I'd like to say what could have been one of my bright spots as are all the stories that are coming out about

141
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Alex losing his

142
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Supreme Court oyez

143
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,351
We are aware of that but inauguration must be taken care of before we

144
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
Jump down that road to a deal with that later in the week

145
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
For all those who work

146
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
For us to get to that

147
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Before we get down to inauguration though

148
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
We've got to thank some Joe Biden donors

149
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
I don't know I lose neck I get contracted to stuff

190
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Anyway Jordan we're going to jump in here at the

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Beginning where it all started

192
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
In the beginning

193
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
There was the word

194
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Buffon

195
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
And then okay

196
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
Harrison Smith

197
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
And America has fall

198
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
You're watching American Journal this is a dirge of sorts a

199
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
Funeral song for United States for the Republic as we know it

200
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
This is now

201
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
A wartime broadcast

202
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
America the Republic

203
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Has Fallen

204
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Donald Trump vacating

205
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
The office leaving the White House

206
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
And taking Air Force One while you still can too

207
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
Florida these people are intensely dramatic

208
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
I like your

209
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,527
I think I start to realize when I look through the prism of like

210
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
People

211
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
I similar to Harrison or to Mike Adams

212
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
Are just overly dramatic

213
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
I do realize that Alex has the same

214
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Except

215
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Manifest isn't like this weird

216
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Over the top modeling America has fallen in heat

217
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Little bit less like

218
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Obviously like

219
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Really

220
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Dramatic

221
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
It is a little bit like

222
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
What's going on is these are all the

223
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
The theater kids who are so into masculinity they could

224
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Join the theater program

225
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
And so they're trying to get all the cedar kids stuff out I would have been a Theatre kid but they were too inclusive

226
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
100%

227
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
I tried to bait

228
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Yeah I had to I had to play football because I was

229
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Do not play football

230
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Theater kid too much

231
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
So

232
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
It's going on throughout most of the coverage

233
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Hiiraan

234
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
The 20th that is wrestling with Trump's Legacy

235
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
In the last hour of his presidency

236
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
Harrison come solidly down on the side of

237
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
That dude unfucked

238
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Anna I got to be honest

239
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Donald Trump

240
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Completely fail

241
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Utterly

242
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Totally

243
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Felt

244
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm having this debate with

245
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
My dad yesterday seeing you saying you know Trump has probably the greatest president in my lifetime

246
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
It doesn't matter

247
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Avail

248
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
He left us

249
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Not

250
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
With any lasting Triumph

251
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
But with

252
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Ash

253
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
You got some ass

254
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
I'm going to take a lot of people probably predict

255
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Did this

256
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
What kind of person would possibly have predicted this remember when he was elected president

257
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
We were

258
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
To give him a

259
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Ciara

260
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Yeah it's

261
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Stuff I guess

262
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Aspiring

263
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Authoritarian

264
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Dictator servers

265
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Sad that they don't get to

266
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
You know what their guy wasn't

267
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
I'm strong enough to eat them

268
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
To the point where they could be a servant

269
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
I was hoping that the

270
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
I was licking with strong

271
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
Powerful

272
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
Ineffectual in a grifter just like my boot I can't believe that my tongue made it all the way through that.

273
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
So quickly

274
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
How many licks does it take

275
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Take to get to the center of trump

276
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
I will say this about Harrison

277
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Was that

278
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
For all the like a trump has failed to kind of talk

279
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
He's a big man he's a big man

280
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
He's big enough to admit that

281
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
He was wrong

282
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
Okay so this clip is only 34 seconds

283
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
We thought he had What it Took

284
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
To do what was necessary

285
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
To save this country

286
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
I guess you would feel

287
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Embarrassing

288
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
If I cared about that sort of thing

289
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
I'm not

290
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
Admit that we are wrong

291
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,479
What wrong really he could have could have done if he just didn't

292
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
He just didn't do it

293
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
I didn't do it

294
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
He didn't

295
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Have what it takes

296
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
Wow we are rugs

297
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Actually nevermind I am not

298
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
Late-breaking news

299
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
That's pretty amazing

300
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
I'm a big enough my Intuit Mint actually I was right

301
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
You like videos

302
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,063
He's completely missing the point of being a big enough bad

303
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Is the the sense of like

304
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
I am an adult

305
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
By immediately undercutting it

306
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
It's my experience

307
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
You talk about it like

308
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Being big enough to admit you're wrong

309
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
If usually the byproduct is like introspection

310
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Wrestled with or like

311
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Oh wait what was it that let us down the road to thinking it was going to be our King

312
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
He'd heard other people say I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm wrong a lot

313
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,439
This is supposed to be the thing that I say and then he's walked

314
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Sit back because

315
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Is he doesn't understand it what's

316
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Is right now course

317
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
Anybody who's listed are shows where this there Greeley Ematic you

318
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Nicki Minaj

319
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Is also there

320
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Expression that you keep

321
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Using

322
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
Politics is war

323
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Referred

324
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
But

325
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Sherman

326
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
No longer exist

327
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
We never lied to you folks

328
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
We have never

329
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Put a

330
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,719
A friendly face on something I was horrific

331
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
We've never told you to trust the plan

332
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
People working behind the scenes that you needed to do nothing

333
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Oh real always

334
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
Shot straight beard Infowars

335
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Am I to do

336
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Today

337
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
You try to do it in a way that doesn't

338
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Give me on a list

339
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Of some sort

340
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
Cuz this is a Brave New World

341
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
This is a new situation that we are in

342
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
We've been discussing it

343
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
This entire week really ever since the 6th

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Drink some coffee is no longer safe to

345
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Hurry it up

346
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Express Yourself

347
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
Believing that the First Amendment

348
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Will protect you

349
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
He says broadcasting is

350
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Not the case anymore whoever threw some

351
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Major stories to show you that

352
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Don't share that sliding on a Tuesday

353
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Ranch

354
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Alex Jones went on yesterday

355
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Leidsa

356
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Fairly well

357
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Is this is

358
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Award

359
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Politics

360
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Is

361
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
War deferred

362
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Politics has a

363
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Replacement for war

364
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Where people

365
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
We elect

366
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
You are fighting for us and Halls of government rather than us

367
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
Brawling it out in the streets

368
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
That

369
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Is no longer the case

370
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:01,087
I don't like his understanding

371
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Politics

372
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
It can't be War deferred and also a

373
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Placement for war

374
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Elevator

375
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Delaying tactic is if that's your description

376
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
Democracy we have a real problem

377
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
It's troubling I think again this is just like him repeating

378
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,311
Thinks he's heard sounds pretty good if you're not paying attention

379
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Okay

380
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,943
Tyler Texas War deferred sounds like something someone strong would say really funny

381
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:32,319
Introducing a report from Alex

382
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
He's going to play that

383
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
Sure what's really funny is it at

384
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
The end of that rant

385
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
He throws it to a Harrison Smith

386
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Peace

387
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:48,191
And so at the end of the video that Harrison played Alex references

388
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,519
Video

389
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
So it's like an Ouroboros of b*******

390
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
But this gets Harrison into thing

391
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
Thinking about how like hey

392
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Pure white

393
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Hey dear Young

394
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
It's going to be bad

395
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
If you're yeah

396
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Yeah

397
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
Calm down this is going to get really bad

398
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
If you're like 50

399
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
You can just go out to the woods and wait it out and you'll be fine.

400
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
But your children think of

401
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
The children

402
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
You're over 50 or whatever you might be able to live the rest of your life

403
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Off your meager retirement

404
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Enjoy it

405
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
Have a nice little place in the mountains

406
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Watch the sunset

407
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Drink your wine

408
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Listen your old music

409
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
But your children

410
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
And your children's children

411
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Are going to be a despised minority

412
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
With no rights

413
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
No future

414
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
No ability to make anything of themselves

415
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Robbed

416
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Constantly

417
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
And the money given to people who hate them in order to replace

418
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
So you can't just

419
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
Ignore this anymore and if you do your part of the problem

420
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
You need to be involved

421
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
You need to be aware

422
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
And we need to fight

423
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Not

424
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Politically

425
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Literally

426
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm not calling for violence I'm letting you know

427
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Violence is upon us

428
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Implemented through the state

429
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
So you're okay surgically

430
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Supercilious mean

431
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
To be very little difference between that mentality that Harrison is expressing and the tiki torch wielding Nazis of the unite

432
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
The right rally

433
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Jews will not replace us

434
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
I listen to Infowars a lot and even from my perspective that was a

435
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
Very explicit overtly to White nationalism

436
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Real blunt

437
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,671
I was wondering what was up here so I went to the American journal page on banned. Video

438
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
And there's a pretty mask off

439
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
Stuff going on over there

440
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,375
Perhaps most telling video title you'll immediately be confronted by

441
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Titled

442
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Stop white genocide

443
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
That is a name

444
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
Intensely direct title for a video and

445
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Scripture really says it all

446
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
Quote Harrison Smith explains why migration is the

447
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
The choice weapon

448
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
One of the elite

449
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
When trying to dominate and destroy a population

450
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Hoof

451
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
It stopped to be more clear than this

452
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Harrison Smith

453
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
Explicitly disseminating white nationalist narratives

454
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
On the Infowars Morning Show

455
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
Which I recall correctly it's supposed to be

456
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Entirely phone calls

457
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
I do remember that being the

458
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
The plan this is not something that's just like

459
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,472
Tacitly supported by Alex by virtue of the fact that it's on his Network

460
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,544
It's just a more explicit recitation of the taco

461
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Complaints that Alex himself spouse

462
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
Constantly

463
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Steve Doocy

464
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,480
I didn't want to just point out that Harrison put out a video.

465
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
Decrying his fears about white genocide and then say that the work was

466
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,672
Was done there far too many lazy commentators will react to titles of things about looking at the body of the Peace

467
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
And I strive not to fall into that trap

468
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
So I watch the

469
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
The structure that Harrison is going for is to make the argument that the treatment of white Europeans in the United States is the same as the treatment of

470
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
The weaker people by the Chinese government

471
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,056
Are people are comfortable with saying that the treatment of the uyghurs could be called genocide

472
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
Harrison's well within his rights to claim that white piece

473
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
People the target of a genocide here and in Europe

474
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
In order to bolster this claim Harrison

475
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Pretty predictable false equivalencies that the Chinese government is accused of forcing uyghurs to be sterilized

476
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
Kaiser be required to take birth control

477
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,560
Here's some then claims that this is the same as the US offering people first

478
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,424
Control and that somehow Decades of propaganda are responsible for people making Family Planning

479
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Choice

480
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
Is a completely insane false equivalence

481
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
And I don't see a good way for Harrison

482
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
That flimsy a spanking is arguing

483
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Just said it

484
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
No I don't think

485
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
I don't think there's any way not to

486
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Hear him say this

487
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
And think what you're saying is

488
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,416
White men are going to be treated like white men have treated everybody else

489
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
Send this country and that's worthy of

490
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Killing everyone

491
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,632
Harrison gets to the point in the video where the argument pivots to immigration

492
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
Because at this point

493
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
The beginning is laying out this groundwork

494
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
And he saying

495
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
What is the same as

496
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
The treatment of the uyghurs

497
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Short nonsense

498
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,944
Harrison primary source that he's reading from is a July 4th article that was posted.

499
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
MPR

500
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Here

501
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,064
Harrison discusses his contention that white people are being

502
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
The subjective

503
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,208
As the government and get this send this if this is a genocide I don't know what is

504
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,120
The do you don't brought millions of Han Chinese settlers into the region with Promises of high salary

505
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Jobs in Free Housing

506
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
My God

507
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Ethnic migrants

508
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Economic migrants

509
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,664
Coming into a region for high paying jobs Beth genocide obviously when it's in China

510
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,760
What about get versiti here you have to understand the distinction folks

511
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Do you support giving birth

512
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
Back and happening to you it's a good thing

513
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
It's diversity it's our strength it's what we need when it's happening to uighur Muslims in China it's just

514
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
By God

515
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
What about you

516
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
I don't know I mean

517
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Hello

518
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Hello come on but wake up

519
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
Dammit a couple of important points here

520
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,944
The first is that the guy who was interviewed by MPR does not say that the form of immigration that Harrison is

521
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Discussing is genocide

522
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
He says that it's a part of

523
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
Policy of ethnoracial domination which is still bad

524
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
Person stops reading right before the guy says quote

525
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,488
The reason why that this has changed

526
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
We do need to probably call it a genocide is

527
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Quite simply because the evidence now for

528
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
First time specifically mean

529
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
One of the five criteria set forth by the UN

530
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Convention

531
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
The punishment to prevent

532
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
One of the crime of genocide from 1948

533
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
Which specifically says the suppression of

534
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
This guy's clearly expressing that bringing the Han Chinese to replace weaker workers doesn't meet the

535
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
National genocide

536
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
But now that there is evidence of birth suppression

537
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Oh that does meet the definition

538
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Harrison is completely misrepresenting his researchers words

539
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,816
Because his agenda is to yell about immigration to the United States and stress way to Griezmann

540
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
Not to cover any of these issues in a meaningful way that helps the audience better understand the world and hopefully put his public opinion

541
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Better policy

542
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
He's trying to make white people scared of non-white

543
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
He's trying to use the prop of the Chinese State oppression

544
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
In order to justify his shoddy argue

545
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,832
None of the complaints that Harrison brings up here rise to the level of meeting the UN definition of genocide which is the

546
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
The standard

547
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
Oprah conversation as presented in his primary source

548
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,256
Article to the UN convention lays out the other five Acts

549
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
How to do genocide

550
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
And what makes it even more difficult argument for Harrison to make is that says quote

551
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
Genocide need to any of the following Act

552
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,288
Committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical

553
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Racial or religious group

554
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
The word intent

555
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Is going to be a really serious problem for Harrison

556
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
The argument

557
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,088
He's setting out to make requires that he's somehow demonstrate that immigration of non-white people into the United States is being done with it

558
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Intention

559
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Of destroy

560
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
Going in whole or in Part B

561
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
That's going to be really impossible

562
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
For him to do without slipping into

563
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
Explicit white supremacist or neo-Nazi

564
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Conspiracy theories

565
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
I mean I I would just

566
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
I would just have to

567
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
To say

568
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Manifest

569
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
Destiny and if you want to start pulling some s***

570
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
Find start giving land back to the First Nations

571
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Otherwise shut

572
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
The f****** because

573
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
These are the people who celebrate manaphy

574
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Trust destiny

575
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
As the greatest thing that ever happened

576
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
I had something to do with God telling

577
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,720
So Harrison goes onto complaints

578
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Some more in this

579
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,816
This Beast we're taking a little side door into his

580
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
Stop white genocide videos from the inauguration

581
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Today

582
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
But I

583
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,312
I got really sort of curious when he was talking about your ancestors being a hated minority

584
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
And all that is like

585
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
This seems like code

586
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,016
I understand a little better and then I found this stoplight genocide piezoelectric

587
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,160
The United Nations convention for the punishment and prevention of the crime of genocide from 19 and 48 specifies

588
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
The suppression of birth

589
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
As one of the

590
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
You know primary

591
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Attributes of a genocide

592
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Now

593
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
If I was

594
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
Some sort of insane conspiracy theorist I might point

595
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
To the ongoing

596
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Attempt

597
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
Buy mini mini mainstream Outlets

598
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
To suppress

599
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
Birth rate of white Americans

600
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,064
Say white people don't have children you shouldn't have children white people

601
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,904
It goes on and on and on we seen this headline over and over again

602
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
But that's not genocide that's

603
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
A good thing

604
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Is remember white people bad

605
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
I don't think that makes Harrison sound like a conspiracy theorist I think it makes

606
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
Harrison Smith isn't seeing the media constantly saying the white people shouldn't have a kid

607
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
It's because they're not

608
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,408
Easy things like interracial couples represented in commercials and sitcoms and he's experiencing that isn't attempt

609
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
How to say the white people

610
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Shouldn't reproduce with

611
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,832
I decided to check out what happens when you Google white people shouldn't have kids

612
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Looking for some headlines

613
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
Looking for something to look into digging around

614
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
Can I can I guess

615
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
That's just real quick

616
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
You are you are going to find roughly

617
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
10000

618
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Reactionary right-wing

619
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
Articles about this

620
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
And very few

621
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
If any

622
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:31,104
Not so much I found the first eight results are just about raising children who are capable of talking about race

623
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Issues they don't say the white people

624
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,760
Your nephew is a 2017 article of the independent title.

625
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
7 reasons people shouldn't have children according to science

626
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
There's nothing to do with white people not having kids

627
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
It's more of an exploration of the research into things like changing friendships at 1%

628
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
21 pool quotes

629
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
Non-parents tend to lead healthier Lifestyles than parrots

630
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
Was that the one

631
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
Okay that was 2017

632
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,776
I was interviewed for that one and they reject

633
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
Did mine which was white people don't have

634
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,712
Oh maybe early version accidentally talk to that one

635
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,552
Go back to being about 280 people being able to talk about Ray

636
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
With children

637
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,904
Closest thing to get really calm

638
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,464
Closest a really complex racial issues nearby

639
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
Is it there's a couple articles about like the Dynamics of

640
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Adoption

641
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
Yeah Transit option that real huge

642
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
But that's not what you're talking about

643
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
Of the search results actually even find an article that

644
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,664
Actually about people advocating the people not have children

645
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
It's not race pace

646
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,808
Is a 2019 editorial piece in the BBC about a group called The antenatal

647
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
You just want no one

648
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:51,232
There's also the voluntary human extinction movement they are but that's not racially-based either that's

649
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
I assume Harrison also looked up a lot of New York Times articles and the like

650
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
From anywhere

651
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Between

652
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,080
1878 n1939 whenever everyone with navigator for black

653
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
People to voluntarily not have children ever again

654
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
Okay I don't know either I would like some

655
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Citations

656
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
I don't think the Harrisons making a serious Point here I think this is just a white identity talk

657
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
I'm going to being presented as if it represent

658
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
3 hours

659
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Sucking Grouch

660
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
I would like

661
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
More ideas

662
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
I would like

663
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Concrete example

664
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Of what white men are going to

665
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Young white men are going to face

666
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
And I would like him

667
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Did you put those up on a wall somewhere just so we can refer back to them every time

668
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
One of them

669
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
People like this

670
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,992
Present like this idea like we've seen all the hundred

671
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
Articles telling why people not tempted

672
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
I haven't named one

673
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Pick one

674
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
And also

675
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
It can't be something that's clearly said

676
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,632
Can't be something that you say that you don't get the reference

677
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,776
Like I said this entire argument really just hinges on Harrison trying to make the treatment of white

678
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
People be equivalent to the Weger

679
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,920
And other minority treatment in China

680
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
I want to

681
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,600
Continue to layout for white genocide I guess is what I'm doing here because

682
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:28,000
After all these years

683
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
Nutty

684
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
I have this weird consistency

685
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,448
I think the genocide of the uyghur people in China is bad

686
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
And I think the genocide of European people in Europe is also bad

687
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
I don't understand the complex

688
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Geography that goes into

689
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Yes I agree

690
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,576
Determining whether one is bad or not I just I'm just such a simple guy

691
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,648
Tumi genocide equals bad and I just don't have

692
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,304
Didn't fit the college think in the University brain that's necessary to understand why it's good when it's against White

693
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,376
Why people in bad when it's against the uighur minority I just

694
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
I just am too dumb I guess I don't know

695
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
I don't think Harrison is too stupid

696
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
His problem is it stupidity or not under

697
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:17,152
Understanding is that he's outrageous lie racist and he's also unfortunately smart enough to know that it's bad for business.

698
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
Just admit that and live open

699
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,528
That's why you have to make you strained comparisons in false equivalencies

700
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
That the experience of being white in the United

701
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
In states or in Europe

702
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,672
Is an anyway comprable to being weaker in China

703
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
That's a ludicrous proposition and

704
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,280
It's why I used to pretend that allegations of force

705
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Sterilization in China

706
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Are the same as the availability of

707
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Give birth control here

708
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,984
Any right-thinking person to hear that argument recognize pretty quickly how stupid it is

709
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
But that's because of

710
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
The crypto

711
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,128
The argument or the false equivalence doesn't actually exist to be taken serious

712
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:54,528
It's only there because Harrison knows he can't come out and express his true white nationalist positions without consequences

713
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,368
I wouldn't say the genocide against Tweakers is bad in genocide again

714
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
That's why people is good

715
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
I would contest Harrison

716
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,768
Point that the situation leads group are facing or in any way compromise

717
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,584
And that's where her son's argument would completely Fall Apart

718
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
I know that because I'm

719
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Was listening to a

720
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
40 minute video where he's trying to defend

721
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
He's failing embarrassingly and really letting his racism show

722
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,896
That said the lonely Shepherd by zamfir slaps okay

723
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Alright

724
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Alright

725
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
The king of the Pan Flute

726
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,648
A couple decent music choices

727
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Because I'm good

728
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
Accuse that heard from other info

729
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Shepherd

730
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,352
Yeah I mean I was going to be a little chilly

731
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
It really does

732
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
That wakes you up

733
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Zamfir

734
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
Branded himself

735
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
King of the Pan Flute as if it was a crowded space

736
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
The bombastic something otherwise

737
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
People aren't going to

738
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:06,208
The king of a flugelhorn

739
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
Don't give a f*** with his title

740
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
The Children of Sanchez such a good song

741
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Good soundtrack

742
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
Sorry anyway

743
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Harrison

744
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
It's two guys going

745
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Keep going

746
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:27,200
1948 convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide which has been ratified by least 149 countries

747
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
Define genocide as any of these acts committed with the intent to destroy a national

748
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Ethnic

749
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
Racial or religious group

750
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
Killing its members causing them seriously bodily or mental harm

751
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
By-the-way vast

752
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
Vast majority of suicides

753
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Vast majority of

754
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Medication

755
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
For depression

756
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Lawn all on white people

757
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
But

758
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
That's a good thing because white people are evil

759
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
Even assuming that everything Harrison just said is true for most of tistical perspective it's still meaningless in terms of his argument

760
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
There's a white genocide going on

761
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:08,160
Again he's using this 1948 un definition of genocide that includes the word intent

762
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Is it really important element of the definition

763
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:17,120
I mean Harrison works for Infowars we probably shouldn't even care what the UN thinks about the subject but he's operating off that definition so that

764
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
That's the conversation that's being hat

765
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
In order for his argument

766
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
To carry anyway

767
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
Harrison is going to have to demonstrate and prove the following

768
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
1

769
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,944
But there are in fact disproportionate medication and suicide rates between races that cannot be

770
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
Explain by other factors

771
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,296
Like income inequality and War access to healthcare

772
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
To that this

773
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,160
This is the result of a concerted plan by some group as an attempt to

774
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
Destroy white people

775
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
Harrison can't even come close to either of them

776
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,840
The best you can do is suggest that mental health practices like psychiatric

777
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,936
Medication or attempt to kill off white people

778
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Because someone's out to get ripe

779
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
That's all he can do

780
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Because there is no

781
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
There's only enough

782
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
Appeal to emotion only an appeal to fear

783
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,944
This is an attempt to get racist people listening away day

784
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
Express the racism without sound

785
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,600
Also a recent paper from the division of vitals

786
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
Statistics

787
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Lcdc reflected in

788
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
2017

789
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,232
Once you adjust for population the group with

790
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,024
By far the highest rate of suicide

791
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,096
Is non-hispanic American Indian or Alaska native women

792
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,400
I eagerly await Harrison's coverage of that

793
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Oh I know I would

794
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,592
So in order to bolster his claims there's a white genocide going on

795
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
The case of Ireland

796
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
He seems to think that their entire population is going to be replaced with immigrants because of a need to do so in order to make their pension

797
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
System work

798
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
Here's be profoundly racist

799
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,696
And idiotic way that his segment on white genocide ends

800
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
You on the other side

801
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Why this is

802
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Very dumb

803
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,888
I don't like what's happening to the uyghurs in China we should be defending

804
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
These people were being systematically eradicated

805
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
By there

806
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Governmental organizations

807
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
And on the other hand

808
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,688
I don't want the people of Ireland to be systematically eliminated by there

809
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
Super State governmental organization

810
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
I don't think

811
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
The pension system is worth

812
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,160
Replacing every single person in your country with a foreigner

813
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
There's plenty to go around

814
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,864
There's more there's more bangladeshis in a single District of a single City

815
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
That country than there are in the entire nation

816
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Violin

817
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,848
Maybe we can help out Ireland maybe we can help increase the birth rate maybe we can stop this genocide at least in Ireland

818
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
Maybe expand that to the rest of the world and recognize the white people are a global minority the least

819
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Elation of any

820
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,672
Racial Division if you want to take the big ones Asian black whatever why do the smallest and they're being J

821
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,000
Decided and that's the headline stop white genocide

822
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,584
Harrison is working off a primary source it's an article

823
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Independent out of Ireland

824
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,704
The article is closed Ireland needs for million migrants

825
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
To sustain state pension

826
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,872
Harrison takes that information combined with the fact that Ireland's population is only like 5 million

827
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,224
So that must mean that they want to replace everyone with immigrants to save the pension system

828
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Yeah that sounds like the Irish

829
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
Problem is a Harrison didn't do any work

830
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
Like even reading the article

831
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,000
The first thing that jumps out at you if you do read the article is that the idea that the country needed for million migrant

832
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,352
To make a pension system work with something that was used as an illustration of the problem

833
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
The country was facing

834
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,960
Regarding having an aging population and meeting the pension

835
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
In a meeting of the pension

836
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,592
I wasn't being suggested as the plan to fix the fence

837
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,224
System they were saying goodbye 2051 they would need 4 million new people paying into the system

838
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
The balance out all the people over 65 drawing from it

839
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
It Harrison wasn't such a

840
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Adobe racist

841
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
He would have kept reading to the park

842
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
Have the article where it says quote

843
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,328
But the statistician and commission members say it's unlikely that net inward migration will reverse

844
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
The current trends

845
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
Migrants would become pensioners themselves

846
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
This article is about a discussion of why this wouldn't be a solid plaintiff

847
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Fix the pension system

848
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:14,176
Because if that were the only approach taken could end up creating more net problem for the pension system then you fix

849
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
The article goes on to say quote

850
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Irish physical

851
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,576
Advisory Council chair Sebastian Barnstead tax

852
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Some spending would have to adjust a van pension

853
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
My pension age would need to rise

854
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,560
Social protection Minister Heather Humphreys spoke at the first meeting and made it clear that a reduction in the amount of state pension

855
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Was not to Beacon

856
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Considered

857
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,936
This article is not about Ireland bring in for million migraine

858
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
Engine system but the headline is written in such a way that it

859
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Easy to use it that way

860
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,360
The four million number is used as an illustration of

861
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,688
Imbalance little exists between those paying into the system in those drawings

862
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,504
From it because the headline is poorly written in because

863
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Harrisonville lazy Craven races

864
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,184
His article can be used to justify an argument that Ireland is engaging in white genocide in order to save its pensions

865
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
Harrison knows what he's doing

866
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
He knows this article isn't about bringing in 4 million mi

867
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
He also knows

868
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
That because it looks like it is he can mislead his audience it.

869
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
Thinking that it is

870
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
Heidi's racist agenda behind that

871
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Impatient

872
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,872
Anyway that's the end of our side door through Harrison Smith piece on white genocide

873
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
I can say with a

874
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Fair amount of confidence

875
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
That this special report was

876
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Quite possibly the most

877
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
And most

878
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,600
Julio argued racism I've ever seen on Infowars

879
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,488
It's the racism equivalent of Harrison saying that the capital of fallen and Patriots were in charge on January 6th

880
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
He's not hiding what he is

881
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
He is eight

882
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Yeah this is

883
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
Cuz what is he saying whenever you says

884
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
We can stop the

885
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
The genocide of Ireland is just

886
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,056
We can make sure that Ireland remains a white Nation

887
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
And then we can save everybody else

888
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
So Europeans for European nation

889
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,736
I'm looking for African Asian

890
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
Chinese people Virgina

891
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
Sing it all the primary source that he's working off of for the circle is a headline that he's misrepresenting it away

892
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Way to use as a racist

893
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Call Joe

894
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Like it's it's outrageous

895
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
I mean it's

896
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
To be expected

897
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
On sublevel

898
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
It's pretty

899
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,336
It's like using story math problems as a like

900
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
Okay it's the migrant Caravan is racing towards the Border it's 60 miles an hour but the white nationalists are going towards the

901
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
Border from the opposite direction at 50 miles an hour

902
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
People will be exterminated

903
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
I don't like this quiz

904
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Bad quiz

905
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,304
I started to wonder about this and I ain't really one of the things that I think is interesting is that like

906
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah I mean a lot of the same themes are exactly the same as what Alex talks about the crypto

907
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Way

908
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
Wayless close to the edge

909
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
Because he knows that there's consequences right

910
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Right people will treat you in a certain way

911
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,319
He'll lose his ability to argue all everyone says I'm a race that they all lie about

912
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Made that kind of s***

913
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
His Wonder

914
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,695
Makes me feel like there's two possible Dynamics

915
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
I want is that like

916
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
Alex's thinking f*****

917
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
Let Harrison do a show that

918
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,471
Extreme as hell that's the white nationalist Waters Market

919
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
Going to punish us for this war

920
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Is it the case that

921
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
Alex's run out of

922
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
F****** steam to the point where

923
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
A bigot like Harrison is

924
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Taking over yeah

925
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:34,111
We're not taking over the whole thing but I can't Resort

926
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
I don't know it

927
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Outrageous those like

928
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
I I think the Harrison might be a much bigger problem

929
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,887
Then he appears Harrison isn't even smart enough

930
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Have to do the

931
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Dumbest

932
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Easiest

933
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Thing that you can

934
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Can possibly do

935
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,799
Which is immediately do what Alex does f

936
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
After saying something that the

937
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Explicitly white nationalist

938
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
Now I have you know me I don't care about white black Hispanic coronavirus red blood doesn't even bother

939
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Other to do that

940
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
New

941
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
An a******

942
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Prelate

943
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
Back to inauguration

944
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,535
Sorry to take that but I felt like it was

945
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Import

946
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
You got to know when the whites

947
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Well I mean I really felt

948
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
Like that was

949
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,543
Something that's my argument for white genocide you got know when they're coming

950
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:30,687
I felt like that was something that was behind the clip of him talking about your like

951
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,063
Your children will be hated minority

952
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
This is kind of think you

953
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
You talk about

954
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
And then I'll get back

955
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
The 20th

956
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
This is a scary thought

957
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,559
Do we know how fake the news is imagine how fake history

958
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
You see this play out in real time

959
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
We see the truth with our own eyes and then we hear the lies about it

960
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Is he the truth

961
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
Of the path at Dak to us

962
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,103
Imagine how false history is

963
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
That is so scary

964
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
That mentality is so scary

965
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Especially considering a week ago we had Alex

966
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,087
Presenting a completely false version of Hitler's rise to power

967
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Infowars

968
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
Does so much

969
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,719
Historical revisionism Antics surrounding very serious issues

970
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
You know that the

971
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,167
Hey we've created an alternative reality for us to live in and we say that everybody else is lying

972
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Can you imagine how much

973
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
More lies are going on with his

974
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,871
You weren't you're basically yeah you're absolutely right like

975
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,431
Hey we've defeated reality in the

976
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
Present are only way to go now is

977
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
The past unless somebody invented

978
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
The Time Machine

979
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:45,183
Well isn't I think that's been the project of a lot of fascist types for a long time

980
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,535
Revisionist ideas about what happened in Germany

981
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,375
Have any influence over text

982
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
Textbooks well whatsoever

983
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
You're not going to get a real history

984
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
Revisionist ideas about the

985
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Confederacy

986
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
It's not too surprising how many people learned

987
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
That it was about

988
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
In school

989
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
How many people probably Allen million

990
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Millions

991
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,087
Maybe even the entire country in our elementary school

992
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,623
System that is designed to

993
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,463
To teach you history and for you to take him to the world they lied

994
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
Straight to your face when you were seven

995
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,911
So Harrison is is going on here on Inauguration

996
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
He's talking about how

997
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
Did the mainstream media msms the globalist

998
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
They've taken

999
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,639
The people who believe that Trump won

1000
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:42,015
And they've turned the idea that Trump on into the big lie that they're being misrepresented

1001
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
This is just nonsense

1002
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
District only the big lie

1003
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
And they're saying

1004
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,255
Even pointing this out or people trying to represent their constituents were all calling out

1005
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,095
Saying this was fake please for the love of God you're supposed to be our representative

1006
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,167
Please say something please stop this deal from going forward

1007
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
They are now being portrayed

1008
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
As racist

1009
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Fascist

1010
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,543
Implementing a new Jim Crow

1011
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
I mean this is

1012
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
Abor review

1013
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
This is beyond anything we've ever experienced before

1014
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
And at the heart of it

1015
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
This is a war against white people

1016
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
That's what you have to realize am

1017
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,719
They are making a concerted effort now they're out of the earth couching it

1018
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,255
Any friendly faces

1019
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Phrases they're saying

1020
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,887
White people are bad must be destroyed must be rooted out

1021
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
Must be ripped out by the roots

1022
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Must be eliminated from this country

1023
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
But this point I got a little bit worried

1024
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
I was like

1025
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,919
I'm moving to I-10 was just checking in on inauguration day I got a little sniff

1026
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:48,319
I don't think I thought maybe Harrison was a big and watched stuff

1027
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,719
The war on white people

1028
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
On the way

1029
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,327
National is literally tried to overthrow the country

1030
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
They've declared war on all white people

1031
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
I was like okay

1032
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,263
What when I sat down to prepare this episode I was thinking

1033
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,663
Alright a breeze through Harrison's dumbass get to Alex and that'll be went like this episode

1034
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,039
This is going to be half the episode probably talking about Harrison

1035
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Terrible

1036
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
These years

1037
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
Hugh

1038
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
Biggity

1039
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Remember

1040
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
That the evil global

1041
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Star now.

1042
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
Declaring war on white people according to Harris

1043
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
Even though last year

1044
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
Only a few months

1045
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Citgo

1046
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
Their plan B was murdering everyone

1047
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335
Well plan B is not to be remembered now cuz

1048
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
It's not the profitable angle

1049
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:51,295
We've got new sales flowchart

1050
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
So he also wishes

1051
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
The Trump was a little bit more authoritarian

1052
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Of course he's talking about this

1053
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
In the framework of

1054
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Optic

1055
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Differences

1056
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Is between

1057
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,815
Trump's inauguration and Biden

1058
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
He's being really dumb

1059
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
I'm here

1060
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Donald Trump won

1061
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,031
Dooley like to nobody expected it but he did it he pulled it out you pulled people through

1062
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
He got elected president of the United States

1063
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Everybody was

1064
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
Very very concerned about

1065
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
Authoritarianism

1066
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
Open 2016

1067
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Before the Trump

1068
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Inauguration

1069
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,671
DC was filled with 65,000 troops

1070
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,975
And there were people going

1071
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,071
On TV who are heads of the

1072
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
Army saying

1073
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
We need to have

1074
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,727
Purity test we need to kick out anybody that doesn't adhere to our

1075
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
View of

1076
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
What it is to be an American and

1077
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Reality

1078
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,919
Entire National Mall was covered in Flags because they weren't letting any people come

1079
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
And the entire that idea Washington DC was lockdown like the green zone in Iraq you tried to throw over

1080
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,951
I would have thought oh God maybe this is the authoritarianism there warning about

1081
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Course I didn't happen

1082
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:08,095
None of that happened in the slightest I wish it had been more so

1083
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
I wish she had been

1084
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,679
More like the the

1085
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,031
Monster that they portrayed him as maybe we wouldn't be in the situation we're in now

1086
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
If he actually

1087
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Used in Iron Fist

1088
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
What is shock someone who works at Infowars revealing what they wished

1089
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
Trump is a dictator

1090
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
If they sink

1091
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:31,391
History is a lie these mother f****** can't remember two weeks ago Clear Lake

1092
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
Turn me about that like

1093
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:38,047
That description of the inauguration is like you're pretending there's no cause to these effect

1094
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
Did that damn it

1095
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
I could be wrong

1096
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,495
But I don't remember in January of 2017

1097
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Liberals

1098
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Overthrowing the capital

1099
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,663
No that didn't happen that didn't happen in that kind of effect this inauguration

1100
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Smaller crowds

1101
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Pandemic

1102
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Bi flag

1103
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
Also about a memorial to those lost

1104
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,415
Bring up the flags as if it's just like a way to fill space

1105
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
Because people could

1106
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Be there soon though there was a symbolic

1107
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,535
Meaning to that I wasn't

1108
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,327
Committed or where I mean

1109
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
Some could argue even a genocide

1110
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
With intent to kill the poor

1111
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
If you go back and look at

1112
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Kushner's f***

1113
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Can statements

1114
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,079
Ml in terms of like the screening of service members

1115
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
That is also

1116
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Because somewhere involved in storm

1117
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
The capital

1118
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Yeah so I meant like I think

1119
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,295
When you have a situation like that

1120
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
It's

1121
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
Not to allow yourself to

1122
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:40,255
To give in to the impulse go on a McCarthy ask witch-hunt

1123
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
The conversation

1124
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,559
About extremism

1125
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,143
An extremist infiltrating law enforcement and

1126
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,495
I did the services like that is something that is long overdue

1127
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,847
But you have to retain your sensibility about it

1128
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,663
You can't just be like oh this guy donates to the heritage

1129
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Foundation

1130
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,479
Therefore he's an extremist

1131
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
You can't go that far

1132
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Need to be careful

1133
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,903
But that's a conversation that you should never pretend you can have with someone like Harris

1134
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,487
Yeah I know it wasn't like in 1863

1135
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
Batman Lincoln was like

1136
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
12 course I need to have a

1137
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
Confederate in my secret service

1138
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Detail why wouldn't I have a

1139
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Confederate soldier in my secret service

1140
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
It would be discrimination for me to get rid of this

1141
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
Literal enemy of the United

1142
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
Midstates for my secret service

1143
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
And then I would also like to say just do it in the same way that like the screening of things is like if a sensible reasonable

1144
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,855
Then you can understand why would happen but you have to resist

1145
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
Going too far with it

1146
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,487
Of course I would say that the presence of

1147
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,815
Security forces in and around the inauguration

1148
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,375
It's something that I don't like to see it's not good

1149
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
It's f***** up

1150
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
I can be again

1151
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
What's that at the same time be enough of an adult to understand

1152
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
Why

1153
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
I can be against the militarization

1154
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
The police

1155
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
Storm the capital of

1156
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,551
I understand that you're like oh no there were so many

1157
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
Troops there I understand that but you need to

1158
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,927
1st and there were so many there because they're worried

1159
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:18,815
There a lot of you wanting to overthrow the United States government people online

1160
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
Empathy

1161
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
Lior sincerely

1162
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Discussing plans

1163
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
Sims 4 other

1164
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,335
Probably if it was it was more than two weeks

1165
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Between

1166
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,991
There might have been a better solution that would have been available time

1167
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:42,111
Crunch kind of situation we never overreact to Scituate

1168
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Valid

1169
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Directions to have

1170
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,351
Absolutely not something you should ever find common cause our allies ship within

1171
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:56,447
Central Warriors about cuz they're not sincere

1172
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Happened

1173
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,591
Any why do underwater literally said the capitalist followed to the Patriots

1174
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
Pretend City didn't

1175
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,759
You don't get to do it

1176
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
You shouldn't

1177
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,159
So you may recall that Alex's said that if they hosted the American Journal doesn't take calls

1178
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,719
They will not be hosting it any longer that is true

1179
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,535
There's nothing to take calls immediately but he does

1180
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Get to some calls

1181
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
And these calls

1182
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
Those are not good happy

1183
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
People whole boy

1184
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,239
This is the Renegade Patriot in Ohio

1185
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
I was just calling in

1186
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,335
Because I've been listening for 11 years and stylist

1187
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,407
But I prompted me to make my own YouTube channel

1188
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
That was inspired

1189
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Partly by Infowars

1190
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
And by

1191
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:46,111
Political prisoner named Charles Dyer started childbearing notice July 4th Patriot on YouTube

1192
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,207
In case you're curious Charles Dyer is not a political prisoner

1193
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:54,047
2012 he was convicted of sexually abusing his six-year-old daughter and send

1194
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
To 30 years in jail

1195
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,703
He's been turned into a hero of the extreme right-wing who curiously call everyone they don't like pedophiles

1196
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
Because he was a member of the oathkeeper

1197
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
It was the type of the

1198
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
Extreme right-wing militia guy they where his house was searched

1199
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
They found a f***

1200
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Open grenade launcher

1201
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,551
How do I get a whole lot about a fella when they call in to Harrison the show say they were inspired to start a YouTube channel because of Infowars

1202
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Charleston

1203
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
That was solves most problems

1204
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Yeah not great

1205
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Yeah

1206
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
Nothing compared to this neck

1207
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:29,375
Text Colorado that's not good this caller is an Escalade

1208
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
After

1209
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
Analyzing the

1210
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,751
Top 10 high rank

1211
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
Pics

1212
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,567
Providing

1213
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,919
All 10 of them have dual citizenship in the state of Israel

1214
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
Do you know

1215
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Don't try this best

1216
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
To get that

1217
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
Support from the Israeli Lobby and

1218
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,903
Really he was basically the best president for Israel a diamond that's actually true

1219
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,719
Yeah it didn't even work

1220
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
The border now

1221
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,279
And all by biting their man

1222
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,679
Before but when you hear a right-wing dum dum like this color bring up someone having dual citizenship with Israel

1223
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,727
It's an expression of deep anti-semitism

1224
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
It goes hand-in-hand with

1225
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
The Holocaust

1226
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,639
Didn't happen this guy wants to complain that Biden has Jewish people in his cabin

1227
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Everybody knows that that looks

1228
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Bad so he

1229
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,039
Tries to couch things to try the couch that hatred of Jews and language that ass

1230
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,343
Concerned about dual citizenship

1231
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
This is a classic Neo-Nazi talking

1232
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
Complained that the Jewish criminals

1233
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,279
I believe Run the World they don't care that what they're doing is illegal

1234
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,679
Because their Jewish Heritage gives them right of return citizenship in Israel so they can just leave there in a void being held accountable

1235
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
Then I saw Die Hard 2

1236
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
Diplomat

1237
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Community

1238
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,615
This is what's at the core of this collar and what he's expressed

1239
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,943
Same here and it's been an Insidious anti-semitic Trope for decades

1240
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Since Die Hard 2

1241
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
This color incidentally is just responding to a meme that went around on Twitter from an account called syndrome of a Down

1242
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Claim quote

1243
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,231
All 10 of Biden's high-profile appointees are Jews

1244
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
That's right

1245
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
Every single one

1246
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
This is a company buys

1247
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095

Intent Biden appointees next Israeli Flags

1249
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Unsettling

1250
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,751
This is a really simple game this Nazi is playing where they just

1251
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,591
Cherry pick Jewish people Biden has appointed to various offices that assert base

1252
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,407
These tender the most high-profile appointees

1253
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
Whatever that means

1254
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
But it's suspicious

1255
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
These people are Jewish

1256
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,343
It's super transparent and anyone who's calling into Infowars to repeat this.

1257
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
Is absolutely an empty semi till proven otherwise

1258
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,511

Is inspired by Patriot pedophiles and potential neo-nazis

1261
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,447
A interesting fact

1262
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
This guy

1263
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
The meme

1264
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Oh my God

1265
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:49,919
Joe Rogan fact-checking here yeah he'll you making a lot of good points I have

1266
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
The image here that's been going around all 10

1267
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,831
Abundance high-profile appointees are Jews and dual citizens with Israel

1268

Real quick there

1271
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,767
The meme that he's reading off of dozen

1272
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:08,095
They are dual citizens of Israel

1273
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,495
Yeah Harrison is added that because he realizes don't want to do it oh boy I got to hit that J too hard

1274
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
Soft in this a little bit otherwise

1275
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359

00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Secretary of State Anthony blinken

1281
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,927
Deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman

1282
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Secretary

1283
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,023
State for political Affairs Victoria nuland

1284
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,583
The office of Science and Technology policy Eric

1285
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Lander

1286
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,423
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David as Cohen

1287
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
Call me crazy

1288
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
I think the people serving in our government serving in the American government should not be dual citizens with another

1289
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Country

1290
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,711
Crazy for thinking it might Auntie Adam height

1291
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,735
Yes sir

1292
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Super Saturday

1293
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:03,647
Exactly what you are really really bad traffic

1294
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
It's Super Bass

1295
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
Except in terms of anti-Semitism in

1296
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,535
I can explain one of the reasons why it's really obvious

1297
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,375
Harrison's complaint is that these people are dual citizens in the United

1298
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Satan is real

1299
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
Having dual citizenship in this

1300
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,983
Case is divine

1301
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
Define solely as these people being Jewish

1302
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
Interesting the people have dual citizenship by being a government is suspicious or wrong is really just a way for these people to say that they think

1303
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,247
Jewish people shouldn't be in government

1304
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,319
Something so obviously

1305
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
Harrison isn't an idiot he understands this dynamic

1306
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Fully well

1307
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
Beautiful lake with big

1308
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,535
Who knows that Daddy Alex will fire him if he speaks to freely I suspect

1309
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,607
Do you do stuff like this this is outrageous

1310
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Yeah

1311
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
Can't be like

1312
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Iru I was I was

1313
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
I was aghast

1314
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:55,615
This is not what I expected on inauguration day

1315
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
And yeah yeah

1316
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:03,295
Expecting that sounded cuz you can't say that they're going to kill everybody now

1317
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
Yeah

1318
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,879
Well we've seen

1319
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,535
Not quite as a Jew should be in the government and maybe it's a function of Harrison

1320
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
Smith being like not a great broadcaster

1321
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Castor

1322
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,631
He's being this

1323
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
Yeah yeah

1324
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
The chops to be less race

1325
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
Man this caller

1326
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,383
Remember there was this

1327
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,783
Nice sweet little Jewish lady who came on to Oprah and said that within the Jewish Community there are people who are not Jewish

1328
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
You're hiding

1329
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,855
Under Judaism but they're not Jews

1330
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,159
They don't follow Moses they don't follow the Torah

1331
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,231
They don't follow the ten commandments actually followed

1332
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
You're not the problem when I talk about you

1333
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,143
There are people who hide behind is Judaism and she

1334
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
Openly admitted they are

1335
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Breeding babies

1336
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,031
People who you can until they're pregnant

1337
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,103
Satanic ritual that went over after

1338
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
Why you doing this she goes

1339
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,919
Power

1340
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,967
Like it was an obvious thing like you should know

1341
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,527
So I don't think these people are actually juice

1342
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
I think they're part of a

1343
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,647
Organization that is satanic that is hiding behind you

1344
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
Wow

1345
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:18,559
I was listening yeah hard on the anti-Semitism and listening to Harrison be

1346
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,119
Completely open to it and not shut it down at all

1347
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,703
And I was thinking I wonder how long it's going to be until we get into blood libel

1348
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,639
This Oprah sacramentality collar is bringing up as from May 1989 and it was a

1349
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,175
Huge embarrassment for Oprah

1350
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,015
What happened is it there was that whole satanic Panic going on in America

1351
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,415
The McMartin preschool trials and it's like 60 year and lurid stories of ritualistic satanic abuse

1352
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
That was drawing ratings

1353
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:54,911
Oprah tried to do an episode of her talk show about ritualistic satanic abuse cases and one of her guests was a Jewish

1354
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
I told all sorts of insane stories

1355
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,543
Butter family performing a ritual murder since the 1700

1356
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
They was prevalent

1357
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
Two Jewish families

1358
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Didn't do anything

1359
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Oprah

1360
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:11,551
The frame the conversation by introducing the gas to someone who's quote mentally Disturbed and under psychiatric care

1361
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
But I think that's

1362
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Good enough

1363
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,695
A better move would not be doing this kind of interview someone you have to

1364
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,511
Preemptively introduces an unreliable source of information

1365
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:24,863
Just so everyone knows I want you to say that this person is not

1366
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Set to be on TV

1367
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,727
And that we're going to exploit

1368
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,127
Putting a mentally unstable person in a position where they're being exploited for ratings

1369
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,199
Fred deeply dangerous accusations about a religious community

1370
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Either way

1371
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
If this happens nowadays open

1372
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,111
F***** everybody awesome

1373
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:55,071
It happens kind of a scandal over a meeting with

1374
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:59,935
Leaders of the Jewish Community apologizing and responding to criticism

1375
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,007
Should never have happened if you're not

1376
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,103
There's better been fired

1377
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,711
30 years later was stealing your hearing about it that's how good it was out from

1378
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,295
Nazi colors show

1379
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,367
This show is absolutely mind-blowing and how expensive it is

1380
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
There's American Journal

1381
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,999
Harrison Smith seems way way more committed to or just willing

1382
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
To broadcast

1383
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,815
Explicitly racism and anti-semitism

1384
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Doesn't the audience

1385
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
Yeah I was

1386
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
I was I was taking a bath

1387
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,935
How how

1388
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
I have

1389
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,591
I mean you know why I would say I think that is just a simple x

1390
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
Explanation which is that Harrison is

1391
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Isn't Rich enough to A1A

1392
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
Money more than eight

1393
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,479
Anybody who's not white

1394
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:49,087
I can't imagine that he has a more lucrative offer than what he's doing at Infowars

1395
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,439
But I can't imagine Alex pays him anywhere near what David Knight.

1396
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
That's true but

1397
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
I also

1398
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,583
I would imagine that if Alex wanted him to Kirby's behaviors he

1399
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
Maybe and then he would get an alias and write a blog

1400
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
Probably trail start a YouTube channel where he wears a

1401
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,103
The mask is everyone wishes

1402
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:16,479
Take another call and what needs to happen

1403
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Is a

1404
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Infowars

1405
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
Obsessed with the idea that there are no go zones all over Europe where the Muslims won't let people in

1406
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,535
Absolutely

1407
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
Conoco zones in a

1408
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,887
America Bank you going to move into a very new

1409
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,447
Dynamic and I've said it before I think

1410
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,055
Geographic proximation will suddenly become very important I think you need to find

1411
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,639
Like-minded people that you can be near that you can protect each other that you can

1412
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,735
Actually put up a substantial force in order to prevent

1413
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,807
The American forces from coming in and

1414
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,415
Robbing you of the rights that you have as a sovereign individual

1415
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
I think

1416
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,583
I'll personally maybe I'm a little biased cuz I'm from Texas but I can't think of a better place to gather Patriots and say

1417
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:08,959
Everybody was out there in America I know it would suck to have to leave your home and and go to a different place

1418
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,495
But if we stay

1419
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,543
Just separated if we stay

1420
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,151
Urbini small Pockets around around don't come one-by-one and scoop us all up you have to

1421
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,943
We have to gather in a single place

1422
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,527
We have to defend that place we have to create areas of land

1423
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
That the

1424
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:29,439
The powers-that-be cannot break into cannot get into we need to have our own autonomous zones

1425
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
Around the country

1426
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Okay

1427
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
All I heard was

1428
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:39,679
I thought Sundown towns were a great idea and I don't understand why we ever stopped that was there something wrong with some done Townsend

1429
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,287
This show gets really weird I lost

1430
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
My taste for it

1431
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
At a certain point

1432
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,967
I have a conversation about getting people to move to Texas to secede

1433
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
He has a South Africa

1434
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
Can call her lady

1435
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,647
Seems to think that apartheid didn't happen

1436
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,743
Couldn't make sense of what you were saying until I don't know any clips

1437
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
It's kind of all over the place

1438
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Yeah and so

1439
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,607
Here is how he goes after break-up

1440
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Before Alex join

1441
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
For a little

1442
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Spirits show on the American Journal

1443
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
This is

1444
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:21,151
Directing agencies to review their actions interracial Equity Everything To Me based off this

1445
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,479
He's talking about like some advice

1446
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
Racial equity which basically means robbing white people and rewarding non-white people in order to basically

1447
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,719
But do a genocide on white people I mean it's not that let's not mince words here

1448
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:39,071
Everything that the Chinese are doing to the uighur Muslims are exactly what

1449
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
The plans are

1450
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,911
For the Biden ministration for white people I mean when you say

1451
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,751
It's a good thing and we're we're making policy in order to decrease

1452
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,823
The share of the population that white people hold

1453
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,127
That is a genocide apart policy let's

1454
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,943
Let's not mince words let's not pretend like this is something

1455
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
That it isn't

1456
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,015
This is a genocide policy

1457
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
To essentially eradicate any

1458
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
Anybody from standing up against these people

1459
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
And I'll have to do with the fact that

1460
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
White people historically

1461
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,959
Actually puts in Freedom into their governmental organizations and that is mostly based on the fact that

1462
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,751
Christianity is a European

1463
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Religion so

1464
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
Third hour begins on the other side

1465
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,871
So now we've shifted into white suit

1466
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
Supremacy

1467
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,943
Straight up there

1468
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
No arguing that

1469
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,807
I will say this is not I will say this

1470
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:32,831
I think

1471
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Harrison has

1472
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:37,695
Is absolutely succeeded when he said earlier he is going to lay out the

1473
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
The case for white genocide

1474
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,399
Calm down calm down

1475
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Alex

1476
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,215
Comes on

1477
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
2

1478
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Stop by the Journal

1479
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
And

1480
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
I was

1481
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Weirded out by

1482
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
By this actually

1483
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:00,479
You're watching American gentleman infowars.com Harrison Smith joined by Alex Jones walking out

1484
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:06,111
Diane I'm just popping in for a segment here to invite all your wonderful viewers to have our live coverage coming up

1485
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Erin just about

1486
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,511
49 minutes of the inflation inauguration of the kind of Chinese five Biden

1487
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,047
Why is Alex coming

1488
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,839
To promote his show on Harrison

1489
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,679
The white nationalists are tuning in Dan

1490
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,263
Get the sense that maybe

1491
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,823
Alex sees a different audience

1492
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,919
Yep appealing to another audience that might not

1493
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Stick around to watch Alex

1494
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,247
Yes he's coming in to promote him

1495
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Himself to them

1496
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
Cuz otherwise like the only place you're watching the American

1497
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,927
Journal his on Infowars extreme yep

1498
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,999
Which would automatically start playing Alex's show afterwards

1499
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:50,399
I'd like to welcome all the Red Ice listeners to Harrison Smith show and I just want to let you know that the Alex Jones Show is up

1500
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
I am

1501
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Alex

1502
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
He thinks the people thing

1503
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Donkey sauce

1504
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
Does he accept

1505
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,567
Is the Trump is going to be leaving off at

1506
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:02,175
Nashi Naman infowars.com thing I'll dare you say he would leave today

1507
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,015
You're a traitor you're agreeing with seeing it as it was I magically

1508
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Said he was going to stay

1509
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
We literally talked to the present

1510
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Okay

1511
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,951
Dr trailer's lawyers I'll talk to somebody else right close to him

1512
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,743
Last few days and he was going

1513
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,375
As soon as he capitulated the day after January 6th

1514
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
It was over

1515
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,471
What happened January 6th

1516
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,287
They sabotage operation

1517
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,383
That was a last-ditch Hail Mary to begin with

1518
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,175
I was listening to that has like it's

1519
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,455
10 AMU South

1520
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,759
F*****-up sounds not good

1521
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,551
Yeah yeah yeah

1522
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,343
He probably just woke up or something

1523
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,415
You know like I didn't I wasn't sure but I was worried

1524
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,815
I was worried the way he's talking is not normal Alex Jones

1525
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:54,911
Are the dog I think that's what I'm hearing that's kind of what I thought

1526
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,447
Explains what's going on okay

1527
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:01,055
So they don't want a big Mainline debate about this they want to have it be esoteric

1528
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,359
They created a secret society

1529
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,175
The inside group

1530
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
Military intelligence

1531
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
And that everything

1532
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Was going to be fine

1533
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
Celebrity pacified I move on

1534
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
From Hewitt

1535
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Set point

1536
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,439
Talk about what vitamins do other to strangle this country

1537
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
During inauguration

1538
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,023
Afterwards

1539
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,119
I do not have covid-19 thing I have to do homework done

1540
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
Add.

1541
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Infection

1542
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,775
I don't want my tonsils have been to see the doctor localized spine

1543
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,335
Dime-sized bottleneck my throat

1544
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,919
But I thought I never take painkillers when I don't think it was right now

1545
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
Okay if you're on painkillers

1546
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
Good time to be at work

1547
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
Do surgery I talk for a living

1548
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
What you got to do then

1549
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Wow

1550
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:00,447
Alright let's play The Show Must Go On

1551
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,727
Nearly as much as

1552
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,751
It could have

1553
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,055
So it's not like you super f***** up

1554
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
Just here like there's hope there's something different

1555
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
It is delivery in that

1556
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
That explains

1557
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
So I think that

1558
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
They thought

1559
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
That

1560
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
Biden would be giving

1561
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Is getting

1562
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Sworn in

1563
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,439
On Alex's show

1564
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
But the time it doesn't work out

1565
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
And

1566
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
You know

1567
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
We get all that

1568
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,351
While Harrison is still hosting

1569
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,167
And Alex has left there for his show

1570
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,983
Tries God bless him he tries

1571
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:40,895
Joe Biden probably wondering where the hell he is right now

1572
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,015
There's a baby that knows what's going on tell ya

1573
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
That's great

1574
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
That's great work

1575
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,879
Harrison just plays Biden

1576
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,671
Speech is acceptance speech

1577
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
Kind of limited late because I think

1578
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:03,679
He's just hoping that by no make a big flow but then you can then respond to the whole narrative about biting on Infowars

1579
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:08,031
Is that he's senile and he can't form sentences so honestly I think this is a bad strategy

1580
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
They're literally

1581
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,079
Earring evidence that he

1582
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:14,175
He can speak and make sentences essentially debunking one of their big talking point

1583
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
And that is how

1584
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,247
The journal raps

1585
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
We closed the book

1586
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,343
I assume he's a big enough man to apologize

1587
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,647
For saying that Joe Biden is not

1588
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,439
He's not there so to pretend

1589
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,303
Never said that he didn't say the capitals fall into Patriot weird

1590
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
So Alex

1591
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,631
Comes in and

1592
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:39,519
He knows what to do a little bit better then then Harrison Harrison just let's buy talk for a long stretch

1593
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,615
Alex Alex tries to Mystery Science Theater that s***

1594
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
Many centuries ago

1595
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
Saint Augustine

1596
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,735
Ashamed of my church

1597
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,063
Road to the people was a multitude

1598
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,647
Define by the common objects of their love

1599
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Define but

1600
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:04,351
What are the common objects ways Americans love children sinuses America

1601
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
I think we know

1602
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
Opportunity

1603
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
Security

1604
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
Liberty

1605
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
Depopulation

1606
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
And yes

1607
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,383
The truth

1608
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,735
Back for watching a speech on Infowars

1609
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,271
Yeah you don't know how it goes

1610
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,855
For somebody who thinks that Biden is senile he got his speech patterns

1611
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:32,255
Pretty well down how much time he has

1612
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,791
It seems like

1613
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,839
Venice Beach

1614
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,887
He proposes that his First Act

1615
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,447
Will be a moment of silence for the America

1616
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
Has lost a covid

1617
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,103
It's interesting because we know that from listening to his show he

1618
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,663
Long stretches of dead air

1619
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
Recycling should be no big deal nothing

1620
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
My First Act

1621
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,575
Who's president

1622
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
Are you ask you to join me

1623
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
In a moment of Silent prayer

1624
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,047
Remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic

1625
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
100000

1626
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,911
Most of them died of something else

1627
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,215
Dan's husband's wife son's daughter

1628
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,031
Wuhan lab that your buddies Obama

1629
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,943
Becoming the people and a bit

1630
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Rescue

1631
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:28,063
What's 7 motorcycles for by the Democrats in the um trichomes murder

1632
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
A most violent year

1633
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,791
Do that already impatient

1634
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,191
Alex pretend

1635
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,799
Except for this moment of silence because of radio restriction

1636
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,591
That sucks nonsense

1637
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,895
He just has to interrupt a moment of silence

1638
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
To like not allow it to

1639
01:13:54,687 --> 01:14:00,575
Two are some spiritual explanation for it in his head

1640
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:06,463
I can't I can't allow my mind to have a spiritual moment on Infowars solutely not yeah

1641
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
That's the really weird

1642
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
He has stage

1643
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
He can't now.

1644
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
You can't let it happen

1645
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:16,447
So this next clip is maybe the only real moment we're on Alex's show itself

1646
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
Those pills my

1647
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
Be affecting you

1648
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
A new and better world or children

1649
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,175
I believe we must I'm sure you do as well

1650
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,503
I believe we will chill when we do

1651
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,319
Will write the next great chapter

1652
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,647
In the history of the United States of American American airborne

1653
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
A story

1654
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:41,023
And I found something like a song that means alot to me

1655
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
It's called

1656
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,607
American

1657
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
There's one verse

1658
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
Where am I

1659
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,007
List for me all the calls it goes like this

1660
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,079
Working prayers of century

1661
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
Have brought us to this day

1662
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,431
What shall be our Legacy

1663
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
What will our children say

1664
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
Let me know in my heart

1665
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,343
When my days are through

1666
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
America

1667
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
America

1668
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,463
I gave my best to you

1669
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,767
Let's add

1670
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:19,679
That's outside our own working prayers this is a frontman dismantle things are great nation

1671
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,471
Statues

1672
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,775
Then when our days are through

1673
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,079
While they burn down syndrome children

1674
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,919
Children will save us he says that he

1675
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,807
They healed

1676
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,719
At the beginning where it just seemed like he was making a lot of sense interjections

1677
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
I don't know

1678
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
Makes sense

1679
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,143
I guess 5 a.m.

1680
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
OVO

1681
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Still messed up

1682
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Alex

1683
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,799
They've been talking about how they were going to be commercial free

1684
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,079
Because

1685
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
Inauguration

1686
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:05,247
14 minutes is what happened

1687
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,831
Now that's fine go for hours

1688
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
It Isn't So

1689
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,903
We're not going to commercial-free I guess until

1690
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,463
Tonight we take calls up until 10

1691
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
Pamela whole rap

1692
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Special guest here

1693
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,143
Alex it expected this inauguration to go all day and realize it's going to be a ceremony

1694
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,191
Real quick

1695
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
Didn't realize that maybe

1696
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,263
Trump's rambling

1697
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
Speeches

1698
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Art

1699
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Normal

1700
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,383
The wedding ceremony part of the wedding is

1701
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Is usually

1702
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Pretty quick

1703
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
Yeah the reception is what goes on

1704
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,015
Takes awhile

1705
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,183
You have maybe someone who's officiating the wedding was a blowhard

1706
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
Either way

1707
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,023
Good bait Alex expect it'll blow hard as a president

1708
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
Cuz last time

1709
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,887
And 14 minutes and he realizes

1710
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
Oh no

1711
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,519
No just going to be a rambling nonsense speech of God

1712
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,591
I am I have no commercial

1713
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,151
Not good look at those commercial breaks back

1714
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,967
Guys I don't have anything to say.

1715
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
Doing this commercial free

1716
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
He gave me

1717
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:16,671
14 minutes of content the even listening to it I had a hard time riffing over Jesus

1718
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Commercial

1719
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
But Alex goes to

1720
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,791
I didn't listen to the commercials on

1721
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
Infowars

1722
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
Itself for a while

1723
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
Cuz I generally listen

1724
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,959
Through the the speeds

1725
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
Genesis Communications

1726
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
Commercials on them

1727
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
Here's what Alex

1728
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,847
Commercials this blew my mind

1729
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759
Okay not yesterday and announced a global government corporate Alliance to redistribute wealth afraid

1730
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:48,159
Planetary Universal income to Global corporations will control to the apps on your phone

1731
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:54,559
Finally it's all now completely official part of the UN great reset

1732
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
Schwab all officially written about it hundreds of books

1733
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359
Agenda 21/30 gets here and the only gets worse like they said into a wood chipper

1734
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:13,759
Brittney Griner

1735
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,111
Spiritual battle and stopping abortion

1736
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,951
What's going on here

1737
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,327
Am I supposed to watch this show or musical cues are

1738
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
Sophomoric

1739
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,399
Their amateurish

1740
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
Yeah I don't

1741
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
I don't know what's going on here

1742
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
I don't know what he's talking about

1743
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,567
I think this is old

1744
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,847
Because the Pope

1745
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,639
When is Easter letter last

1746
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Steer

1747
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
Disgust Ubi

1748
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,991
Yeah but maybe the world is approaching

1749
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Single-point where are Universal base

1750
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Something, something we should

1751
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
To be considerate

1752
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:53,439
I couldn't for I don't know if there's a double down on that but that was like a big story in April

1753
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Yeah

1754
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
I don't know I just

1755
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
I thought the music

1756
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:02,143
Really dark and like music

1757
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
Is that a cup

1758
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,751
Is that a commercial so much you're just a

1759
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
An interstitial

1760
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:13,663
You think there's a product that he's selling confused about supposed to listen to Infowars

1761
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,967
Because you be I might be coming I don't know

1762
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
I can't actually remember

1763
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,391
I was caught off-guard by that left turn to like abortion

1764
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
I forgot the

1765
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,303
Previous part of the commercial might've ended up in like a body's commercial there's other

1766
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:35,423
Anyway we get back to Alex's coverage of the inauguration

1767
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
In which is now over

1768
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,519
15 minutes into a show

1769
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,335
I thought you got to you got to do what he does

1770
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,615
I assume you didn't listen to the

1771
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
The Poets

1772
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
No

1773
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
He do anything else

1774
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,015
I mean maybe in the evening

1775
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,575
Coverage they went over the

1776
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
Play Party ice bath

1777
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,695
Lady Gaga a little bit

1778
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,023
Yeah why not Alex has a Gaston

1779
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,583
Who we've been curious

1780
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
About his whereabouts

1781
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,935
The FBI might be as well okay

1782
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,775
On the road I'm on on short notice

1783
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:18,176
Obviously don't get your tag on what's happened how people that were delusional about Trump being Invincible how they're going to handle it but

1784
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,456
Cashew

1785
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,016
They're clearly saying domestic terrorism is here

1786
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
They're clearly preparing to wind-up Baraka

1787
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,392
You're an arrogant American people

1788
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,440
Spiros

1789
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,768
Founder of The Oath Keepers

1790
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,352
Been wondering what he's up to

1791
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
Interesting Alex doesn't

1792
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,656
And start with

1793
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
Haven't seen you since

1794
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:46,336
How was the sixth time what happened hey Stuart Rhodes you're on the road

1795

Yeah definitely wasn't too bad I'm not done nothing but he want

1797
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
Anything but

1798
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
F***** up dude

1799
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Here

1800
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
Is disappointed

1801
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
In Trump

1802
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
In very similar ways

1803
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,672
Is the Harrison Waters

1804
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,208
Everybody sees right

1805
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
These are not

1806
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
President vice president

1807
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
These are tricon agents

1808
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
Roosevelt ebird.org

1809
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
Your view on all this

1810
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
Realized

1811
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,264
Is that you know Trump actually fail

1812
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Is the pop

1813
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,336
Consider it a dereliction of Duty

1814
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,664
And frankly cowers in the face of the enemy I'll be blonde

1815
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,480
And we were calling for him to use Insurrection Act

1816
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
All through the summer

1817
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,552
You did not do it

1818
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,600
And he

1819
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
How you sound

1820
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
I mean

1821
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Responses like

1822
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,536
As expected as it you could

1823
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
It could be

1824
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
Disappointment

1825
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
He has been

1826
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:47,008
Very clearly calling for truck to me wanted to overthrow the government

1827
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,032
Institute

1828
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,712
It's to deputize him and all of his buddies the militias

1829
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
Tell them up to

1830
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,064
Restore order in the country

1831
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
Of course he's disappointed

1832
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,904
He was really excited

1833
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,208
This is the closest who's probably ever going to get

1834
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,536
President being like yep you guys are my Army now

1835
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
That's about as yeah he wanted a nuke

1836
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,888
Confederacy and he almost

1837
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,960
Got it man now we said no

1838
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Symbian like

1839
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,776
Hey the line is it wasn't

1840
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
You guys

1841
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
On purpose

1842
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
And he was like

1843
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,664
But I want to tell people that we should do it again

1844
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,712
Well he does he has an interesting

1845
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
Take on what happened

1846
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,064
A little bit but Alex certainly doesn't want to start

1847
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,112
He wants to start with

1848
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
A fake leader

1849
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
Tell him because he's a fake leader

1850
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Stuart news

1851
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
Constitutional

1852
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
Scholar

1853
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,328
You went to Yale

1854
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,376
Can you imagine how many lies are in history

1855
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,960
Stewart

1856
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,008
He's just like f******

1857
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
We don't have to follow laws now

1858
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
And all kinds

1859
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Who sang

1860
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944
It's the same excuses we've always heard

1861
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
We were surrounded by bad people whose fault was that

1862
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
And he's still

1863
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,136
The commander-in-chief had any responsibility Step Up

1864
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,672
Refill the do that

1865
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
Whitehouse Nidoqueen Audi

1866
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
Illegitimate

1867
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
Eating pass

1868
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
A so-called legislation

1869
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,104
Rules are pretending now

1870
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,920
I got three Supreme Court just

1871
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,456
Justices who don't count anymore

1872
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:35,040
That's how we're going to do this that's how this rule works.

1873
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,600
I get to choose who I think

1874
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
Is the government

1875
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
This is not

1876
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,000
The way for a cohesive Society to work

1877
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
I mean

1878
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:48,096
Makes sense because

1879
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,144
Their goal is not to have a coherent

1880
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,680
Incohesive

1881
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
It's time to declare in

1882
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
Independence

1883
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
Amazing a truck

1884
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,200
Our country be stolen like this are governor

1885
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
So we

1886
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,416
We still defend the Constitution but they're the ones of the Earth

1887
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,952
And the vile

1888
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:19,328
I didn't get stronger your community be raising local militia

1889
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,632
You need to

1890
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,656
The nullify

1891
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,192
Refuse to comply

1892
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
Schedule together

1893
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
Okay

1894
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
Okay so commit

1895
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,360
Crimes and kill cops when they try and arrest you

1896
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,504
Man

1897
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,808
What pretend laws

1898
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,344
By this point I'm at

1899
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,696
I would like to know specifically which ones are pretend and which ones are not for

1900
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,744
Anything that has Biden's

1901
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,072
Signature on his Hancock on it

1902
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
That's fake

1903
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,632
Look

1904
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,656
I

1905
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
Can't

1906
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,448
Say enough house

1907
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,984
Stressed out I was

1908
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
But I was looking

1909
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:03,360
I got really caught with a left hook out of nowhere by Harrison

1910
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,896
Over racism

1911
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,456
Anti-Semitism I was surprised by the way

1912
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,272
Going through his shed

1913
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,040
Much more of a

1914
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Slog

1915
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,856
Then I expected and it made it

1916
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,160
Like it was it was taxing

1917
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
And then it's the same time

1918
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,232
Filled me with all kind

1919
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
The thoughts about

1920
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
Alright

1921
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,608
I guess the Morning Show on Infowars now is just like

1922
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,216
White nationalist happy hour bigot time

1923
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
And that seems like a bad

1924
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Things to be gone

1925
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
Let me get into Infowars

1926
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:38,432
Is itself like Alex's show and you got store roads coming in

1927
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
It's just like

1928
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
Frank discussion

1929
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
About like the

1930
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
The government isn't real

1931
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,320
We need to secede

1932
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:49,696
And this is doubling into talk on Harrison's show about creating these enclaves where

1933
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,744
You can protect yourself from the America

1934
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
Sundown towns great

1935
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
Eats

1936
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
F***** up

1937
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,168
Don't they already have white nationalist compounds in the Pacific Northwest

1938
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,752
Tiger some around here

1939
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:06,080
And everybody's just like it's the Pacific Northwest I guess you guys do

1940
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
I don't

1941
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,640
No enough

1942
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
To know for sure but I believe I've heard

1943
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:15,808
Artificially there's a place that has that character

1944
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,672
So one thing that Steve Stewart is clear on is that he's gotten the memo

1945
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,208
I've got a s*** on qpp

1946
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:26,048
The only silver lining in all this

1947
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,096
Finally shut up

1948
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
Cuz all they did the entire time

1949
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
Oh no

1950
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
The bad guys

1951
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Delusional nonsense

1952
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
Who was an absolute psyop

1953
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
All done one

1954
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,968
To get you all be lulled into a false

1955
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Security

1956
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,272
And just be asleep

1957
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
That's what happened

1958
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
For Years yet

1959
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,856
People sitting on their hands

1960
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Doing nothing

1961
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,416
Waiting

1962
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,464
The plan when is this miraculous day

1963
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,488
But never came

1964
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
It was a master

1965
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,864
But now you going to wake up smell the coffee and realize

1966
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
Now you got to do with the heart

1967
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
You know who else was sitting on their hand

1968
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,544
It's doing nothing for a long time

1969
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,360
People like Alex and Stewart Roads at like

1970
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
You know these people who

1971
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:18,528
Thought they had something to pick up game from qanon it's hella got to a point where they realize nope

1972
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
I can't gain anything from this

1973
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,368
And now they sound like people

1974
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:25,696
Who we are associated with like all of a sudden

1975
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
They're pretending that people who have

1976
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
Maybe more left politics

1977
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:35,168
People like the guy the qanon anonymous what haven't been like banging the drum for a long time

1978
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,472
Talking about the dangers and the

1979
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,520
Misleading nature of

1980
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
Qanon

1981
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
I have no patience for that

1982
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,872
You guys have all just

1983
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,176
Jumped onto this now because you realized

1984
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Well

1985
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,224
That's our

1986
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,808
There's a good chance

1987
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,856
That we can bring in some of the people

1988
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,904
Anyone who has

1989
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Already

1990
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
Decided that Alex Jones

1991
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
Controlled opposition

1992
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Because of qanon

1993
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,048
Maybe we can get them into our revenues rain

1994
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
Isn't the end

1995
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:08,192
Application of his argument though that he wanted more people there on the 6th to overthrow the government

1996
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,824
No because then

1997
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
Biden had been inaugurated

1998
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
Hahaha

1999
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
Well you got me

2000
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:32,768
Is that cute people because they were lulled into a false sense of security did not show up on the 6th in order to over

2001
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Throw the government like

2002
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,864
I mean I think that you could read

2003
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,424
His comments and maybe some of the even like Alex

2004
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
His comments that way

2005
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
I don't think that's a totally fair Reed

2006
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,056
I think it's a possible reading

2007
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:45,824
But I think it's

2008
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,128
Like the way that they intended

2009
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
He's more like

2010
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,968
There's organizing that you could do there's

2011
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:58,368
Information Warfare you can engage in that you were who are into a false sense of security about you thought Trump

2012
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,416
Was bulletproof right

2013
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
You could have been banging on doors in Georgia

2014
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,280
I think that's what they want you to hear

2015
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
There you are

2016
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,400
I am very much unfair and I'm telling you right now

2017
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,704
He wish there were more people on the 6th

2018
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
Anyway I speak no sex

2019
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,848
I was trying to get around to asking about that

2020
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
Hobo

2021
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,688
Give me your take on top of the Capitol

2022
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,480
I mean we got set up there bad

2023
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,808
Wilshire ice bus tickets

2024
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,344
I think it's I see it like this

2025
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,368
Yes

2026
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,416
Actors that made sure

2027
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
The doors are wide open

2028
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,720
But

2029
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,256
For all of us.

2030
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Use the rhetoric of the left

2031
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,560
Deb

2032
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
Storming the castle were storming the capital

2033
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
And and

2034
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
You should disable

2035
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
The most ever trespassed

2036
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:54,688
Rhodes has a lot riding on people believe in the people who were at the Capitol just trespassing

2037
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,784
You see I'm like antifa The Oath Keepers are a group that exists

2038
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:01,088
Instant road is the head of

2039
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:06,976
Website where you can donate to them and everything and they have an online store we can buy official merch

2040
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,768
Ethan actual group

2041
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,304
It kind of looks bad

2042
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,376
Three members of the group get arrested after storming the capital

2043
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:17,984
And they're charging document lays out how they planned for weeks in advance in order to eat

2044
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,336
Kill members of Congress it took a lot of planning

2045
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
Sing 2 trespasser

2046
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,528
Thomas Caldwell Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowell are all of Keepers from Ohio

2047
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
And they're going

2048
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
Going to prison for a long time

2049
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
According to an article in The Daily Beast

2050
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:38,976
Caldwell stands accused of organizing a group of 8 people to aggressively disrupt

2051
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
Desertification of the Electoral College

2052
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
The group used Facebook

2053
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,864
Buck in the walkie-talkie app Zello to

2054
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
To communicate with

2055
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Which is really f******

2056
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,704
It's stupid because now the FBI has all that s***

2057
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:53,824
Including that messaging with someone on Facebook who is apparently encouraging them to kill members of Congress

2058
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,592
Sing

2059
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,152
All members are in the tunnels under the capitol

2060
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Silverman turn on gas

2061
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:03,296
Bill Gates is going to inject us all with computer chick

2062
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:08,416
Tips to know where we are at all times so we need to protect ourselves by using

2063
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
Did apps while in the capital

2064
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,072
After leaving the capital Caldwell posted on Facebook quote

2065
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,656
Probably scuffled with cops and drove inside to hide

2066
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:22,496
The doors one guy made it all the way to the house floor another to Pelosi's office

2067
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
A good time

2068
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,312
We need to do this on the local level

2069
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,384
Storm the Capitol in Ohio tell me when

2070
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,688
In this individual case Stewart

2071
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,480
Personal hand maybe clean

2072
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,832
What are the messages that the FBI had in the charging document was Caldwell saying quote

2073
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,880
I don't know if Stewie has even gotten

2074
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,696
Out his Call to Arms but it's a little freaking late

2075
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,744
This one we're doing on our own

2076
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,048
Will link up with a North Carolina crew

2077
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,448
Oh man Stewart read that would like

2078
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:56,800
Yeah

2079
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,920
I guess you can take the best-case scenario for Stuart roads is to say that he's responsible for

2080
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:06,272
Restarting a decentralized right-wing extremist militia organization that he has so little

2081
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Control over

2082
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,088
But now it's being used by members

2083
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,880
To plan militaristic takeovers of

2084
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
State and federal capital building

2085
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,512
Also he might be in hot water because the charging document

2086
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:19,584
For those Oath Keepers does include a charge of conspiracy

2087
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:24,704
Explicitly alleges that they quote conspire together and with others

2088
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,032
Whose identities are known and unknown to law enforcement

2089
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
At this time

2090
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:33,664
That's not a brief Glimpse to see when you're the head of an organization that these people who are gone

2091
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
Going to jail for a very long time working

2092
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
Spider-Man

2093
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,504
What I'm saying is

2094
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,808
I would still be worried if I were Stewart

2095
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,088
Even though that

2096
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,672
Good of the Stewie thing is pretty good for him

2097
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,720
A lot of our generals

2098
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Flipped

2099
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,304
And I

2100
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,584
I just good

2101
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,352
Is this good or bad

2102
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,984
It's tough to be concerned about it it's probably his best play to pretend people are just

2103
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
They were just Chris

2104
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,480
It's no big deal

2105
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,296
A few members that were in there

2106
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
When they

2107
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,624
Defense fund

2108
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
Picture of a

2109
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,696
They did not do that under my orders they did that

2110
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,024
Contrary.

2111
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Always.

2112
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
But I'm not going to

2113
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,080
Has horrible people or Traders Rincon.

2114
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,640
Too many on the right order

2115
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
In the same

2116
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,480
Police open the doors after a few people knocked

2117
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,272
Some of the windows they were ordered to

2118
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,320
Does sucking enough people to have a crowd

2119
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,160
Stewart don't you understand we already have the narrative

2120
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:54,560
You have your own personal issues and I understand are you don't want to throw your people under the bus but they are going to jail

2121
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
I feel for you

2122
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,216
Infowars has a narrative and I'm not going to

2123
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,008
That all

2124
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,800
Yeah hateful your ass hey buddy

2125
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
You can thread

2126
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
Define needle of

2127
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,432
Could they overthrew the capital but it's bad that they lost

2128
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:13,504
I wish you the best I have fun

2129
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
Have fun

2130
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,552
You're also probably going

2131
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Jordan

2132
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,952
Stroger some interesting ideas

2133
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,976
About cancel call

2134
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,536
That hard

2135
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
Apparently I don't know exactly what the

2136
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,144
The route is

2137
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,168
How you get there

2138
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
From 8

2139
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
See

2140
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,776
Right but you start with cancel culture

2141
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,312
Okay then things get out of

2142
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,384
Control are we going to get back into white genocide

2143
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,176
Masquerade

2144
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,968
People Dead in Ditches

2145
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,016
Don't play the good cop in say

2146
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
We come in peace

2147
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
They really come for war Stewart Roads

2148
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,392
What do you expect

2149
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
From the left

2150
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,328
Are going to follow through with cancel culture

2151
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,376
Tenzan into the ditch

2152
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,912
It's worth going to end

2153
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,728
If you don't stop it ends in a ditch full body

2154
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
Throughout their history

2155
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,336
Tattoos of State Rep

2156
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,128
From the Mexico those calling for all of us

2157
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
You were Trump supporter

2158
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,224
To be tattooed Wildomar

2159
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Visible

2160
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
They will know who you are

2161
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,600
We need to understand that we're

2162
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Or worse

2163
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,720
Citation needed New Mexico State Rep

2164
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,768
So if I understand correctly if

2165
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,328
Tubing can't rub one out in a meeting

2166
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
We're all going to mass grave

2167
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:39,264
Yeah you remember how Mi got rid of his political opponents by bringing up blog post

2168
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,360
Yeah that was that was the

2169
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:46,432
Main source of issues for the cultural revolution

2170
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
And I'm pretty sure

2171
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
God

2172
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:53,856
I just can't stand this overly dramatic

2173
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:54,880
Person

2174
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
Making these

2175
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,184
Petty complaints

2176
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:01,536
Simultaneously being the leader of a f****** militia

2177
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,352
Where people did storm the capital on

2178
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
Seem to have pretty nefarious

2179
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:14,080
You know like when you're so used to having uncontrollable and impenetrable privilege

2180
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,360
Your entire life

2181
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
And the lives of your forebear

2182
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
The idea of equality is threatening

2183
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
Sure but

2184
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,040
Let's just remind ourselves

2185
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:23,808
What's that

2186
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,856
Best from abiding presence

2187
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
Didn't see we're going to get

2188
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,160
A little bit more

2189
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,744
It's not going to change too much

2190
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,304
True

2191
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,888
And I think that you'll see more coherent

2192
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
And more

2193
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,216
Sincere aggressive critique

2194
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,240
And action

2195
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,264
In front

2196
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,848
Hundred percent organizing

2197
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:52,224
Against or in order to push policy for Biden

2198
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
From the last

2199
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,064
Then you will from the right culture War nonsense

2200
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
Yes a bunch of

2201
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,880
A Griezmann

2202
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
And you'll see

2203
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,696
Anytime

2204
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
What's 2

2205
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
Four more coherent

2206
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Yeah policy

2207
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,816
You find it

2208
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,096
Hard to

2209
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Think that

2210
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,144
You don't like watching

2211
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
Portland happen

2212
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:16,288
Just recently

2213
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,056
Reacted

2214
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
It struck me

2215
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
That

2216
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,920
More likely what we're going to see from the capital riot

2217
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,944
It is not that

2218
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
People are going to go back

2219
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,248
DC but the cops

2220
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,272
Going to f*** people up at

2221
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,832
You know like the DC overthrow is

2222
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,856
Is going to everybody

2223
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
80 minutes cops

2224
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:37,536
F****** people up video

2225
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:44,704
I think I think it's entirely possible and I think there'll also be the other day

2226
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,240
And that is ice

2227
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,800
Think that there'll be a lot of people who end up going

2228
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:52,640
Going to prison at least get charged with a bunch of stuff

2229
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:56,224
And I think that we may or may not here follow up

2230
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,272
Saint a lot of a lot of people

2231
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,320
Be jammed up for that

2232
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,856
And I hate

2233
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,928
3 bummer Stewart Roads is militia members

2234
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:08,000
At least it's unfortunate that

2235
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,280
The people who created

2236
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
The

2237
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,608
Conditions are absolutely not going to

2238
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:15,168
Rico

2239
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,496
Anyway store believes that

2240
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
You know that guy

2241
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,312
Left

2242
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,360
Sitting president who was real

2243
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,992
Alright that's it there is a potential for future election

2244
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,344
Future elections

2245
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,928
Began go Wells

2246
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,976
But there's something happen for these elections

2247
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
Let's go out

2248
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
That is

2249
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,792
Paper ballots

2250
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,816
But also

2251
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,120
I'm happy with paper bag

2252
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
Hold on hold on

2253
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:49,984
That's with the beginning beginning there's a second step to this

2254
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,288
Is Ludacris I don't know how I feel about this

2255
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
30 seconds

2256
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,456
We no longer have a legitimate

2257
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
This is

2258
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,552
Actual sitting with legitimate president

2259
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,368
We will see if we can ever have one again but snore choir

2260
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,952
Any local elections you must insist on bigger balance

2261
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,720
They won't do it

2262
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,768
Hold your own parallel election

2263
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Prove

2264
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,888
Make sure you have a way to prove that

2265
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Bottom up

2266
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
So you take it back

2267
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
That's right Stewart

2268
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,824
How do you how do you do that

2269
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:31,200
I do have a second election I think the funny thing the funniest thing about the

2270
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,760
Is that the only people who would be

2271
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,064
Furious at the results of us going

2272
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,624
Two entirely paper ballots

2273
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:44,000
I have zero doubt in my mind that if we were using paper ballots Stacey Abrams would have

2274
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
Open governor of Georgia

2275
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,816
Zeroed out

2276
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,352
I will I don't know

2277
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,376
I don't know

2278
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
Maybe

2279
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,168
I don't I don't

2280
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
I don't know what I

2281
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,240
Think entirely wood

2282
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
Change

2283
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,056
Cuz I don't believe that there's rank

2284
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
Corruption of

2285
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,384
Electronic voting

2286
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
I think that there is

2287
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,528
Problems with gerrymandering and access to polling place

2288
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:10,880
And I don't know if that would be fully solved by paper ballots

2289
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,672
I would say that you know

2290
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,976
One thing that would be

2291
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,816
Befriend more helpful than paper ballots would be

2292
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,864
Having a holiday for life

2293
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:27,264
Having multiple days the people can vote people are doing

2294
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,896
We were making progress toward totally and also expanding access to remote voting

2295
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:39,296
13 Republicans away from how many polling places are allowed in let's say majority-black neighborhoods

2296
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,856
Not and not letting people like

2297
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Stewart's friend

2298
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,464
Hang around outside

2299
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:51,840
I like that more progress than paper ballots but I will say the one thing that is stupid

2300
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:56,448
Is the idea that what you should do in you can't have paper valid

2301
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,984
Is run a second election

2302
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,520
A parallel election would

2303
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
People a lot

2304
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
About

2305
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,848
How you would want to

2306
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,920
Here's a really good processor

2307
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
Could get some verted and you'd never know it

2308
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,528
So you're running a second election sure

2309
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,416
How would you ever know

2310
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,024
Well because they would also be run by the Georgia

2311
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:28,192
Or why would they ever do that because right-wing nut jobs wanted

2312
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,592
No

2313
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:43,552
So dumb I think they should have the UN coming to observe the results of the election I think these guys were

2314
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,344
Middle of it

2315
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,160
Alex

2316
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:52,768
Earlier storage said Trump is a disappointment he failed

2317
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,072
Step Up When fruity called

2318
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:59,936
Yeah all these people are going to be going around and saying that he was surrounded

2319
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
Excuses for

2320
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:07,104
Who like Alex and Rodger Stone and Steve pieczenik and Jerome corsi

2321
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,896
Immediately after

2322
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,760
Inspector Road BLK Percy was on

2323
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,320
Alex Jones Show

2324
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
Last hour

2325
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,904
You really failed

2326
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,928
Department

2327
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,464
Bob Marley

2328
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,768
What's the lawyer for trump it was in some of the meetings

2329
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,864
They were planted in the military arrest Trump if he did that

2330
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,656
Even though it was lawful

2331
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,984
Totally surrounded

2332
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,568
Oh. Sounds like you're the kind of person who is Stuart was talking about has a note

2333
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,896
This is just

2334
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,712
Clip of Alex being a narcissist

2335
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,248
Head-on inaugurate

2336
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:50,880
I'm just an always try to steer you as accurate as I can with the best info I have

2337
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
With real research

2338
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,208
We love forkel

2339
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
Understanding a

2340
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,512
Quote sources

2341
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,584
I'll tell you about the time I do more than my forces

2342
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
What

2343
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,192
Pentagon calls me up

2344
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,240
CIA called Meetup

2345
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,776
That's what I said

2346
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
Thanks

2347
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,616
Not the other way around

2348
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,896
I have a good political

2349
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,432
I'm doing this a long time

2350
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
Sabbat train Hitler

2351
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,528
Feel hard knot

2352
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,808
As an organic

2353
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,136
Patriot citizen wasn't praying by the cyst

2354
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,952
Matt is seen by the system

2355
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
The proof

2356
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,768
I'm someone's real

2357
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
Route

2358
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,840
Pull themselves up

2359
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,936
I'm not telling you that

2360
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,472
Powerful

2361
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,264
Telling you that because

2362
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
Fellowship years in the Lady Gaga

2363
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:49,504
Those pills might be kicking it in the Lady Gaga

2364
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,832
They really do respect people who pulled themselves up

2365
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,112
How did Alex

2366
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
What's good as first showing

2367
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,696
His dad bought an ad

2368
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,232
Radio

2369
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:02,048
I think it's really funny

2370
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
Is like this imagining

2371
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:04,864
Any others

2372
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,472
Show where like somebody interview somebody about like a Medicare policy or something like that

2373
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:15,872
Commander like you know what I know way more about

2374
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,040
Rest in peace to Larry King if only he had a few broadcasters just like

2375
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,856
Man all these people that I talked to her f******

2376
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:32,256
It's stupid the government calls me anybody

2377
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,304
In any context other than Alex Jones

2378
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,840
It become so rude

2379
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,424
Or how rude it is

2380
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:46,336
This is the kind of dick head that he is seeing if you have an Mo for long enough people will just be like 5

2381
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,384
Find also speaking

2382
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,920
With Larry King

2383
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,992
I was reminded on his passing

2384
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,784
A lot of people post

2385
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,368
The clap

2386
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,184
And if you have it

2387
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,976
CNET go go check that out

2388
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,768
Larry King was on with Dave Rubin

2389
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,072
They were doing a live broadcast

2390
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,608
And Larry King answered

2391
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,888
To call from his son

2392
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,168
It was

2393
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
Incredibly rude

2394
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,984
Beautiful

2395
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,080
Forever bee-utiful

2396
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Lovely

2397
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,504
I love it so Robert Barnes shows up now call we got to have some

2398
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,064
Constitutional law to tell Rosario

2399
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,136
Oh that's right

2400
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:34,976
That's right he's just basically there to sit on Cube War I think that's

2401
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
Barnes's

2402
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
New thing

2403
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,840
His new branding is anti Q guy

2404
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,912
He also has an idea

2405
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,704
Trump needs to do

2406
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
I think

2407
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,032
Oops a great skills as marketing

2408
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,336
In his great asset is his brand

2409
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
And so he should Leverage

2410
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
Both

2411
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,200
To look at independent news media Network

2412
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,736
Independent information

2413
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
Distribution Network

2414
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,320
Independent social media platforms

2415
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:03,904
Maybe look at independent Banks and financial institutions

2416
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
The realities are

2417
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
There's going to be huge demand

2418
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,512
For all of those things

2419
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,304
Some people that are Trump supporters

2420
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,584
Because of the censorship

2421
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,352
Campaigns

2422
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,144
And the blacklisting campaign

2423
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:17,984
By the institutional media by employment institutions by

2424
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,520
Financial institutions

2425
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,312
By the social media oligarch

2426
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,384
The only way to counteract that is to have our own

2427
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,456
To do to replicate and repeat

2428
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,480
Infowars

2429
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,272
Build an independent

2430
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
Bran

2431
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:31,808
That's not

2432
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,856
Depended at all either

2433
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:37,440
Corporate donations or sugar daddy billionaire

2434
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,976
But also isn't dependent on

2435
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,024
Wake Tech distribution platforms either

2436
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
The Infowars

2437
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,840
Is the model in the template

2438
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
The president tumiran

2439
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
Unfollow in a broader context

2440
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Text of Industry

2441
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,008
I'm not sure that I would want to be involved with a bank that's

2442
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,544
Modeled after Infowars

2443
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,872
Like I don't think I would feel confident have my money held by people who work

2444
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:59,456
Constantly ranting about the devil and how they might be out of business next week

2445
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
I don't know

2446
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,016
There's some good financial advisors

2447
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,368
I think that those business models are

2448
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,648
Especially ones like

2449
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,672
You know

2450
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,976
A lot of that has to do with confidence

2451
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:16,352
That's what was one of the things that will go a long way

2452
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:20,960
Depositors not make a rush on their money trying to get it out

2453
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,984
Is a

2454
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:24,288
Maybe here's what I want to do

2455
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,336
I want to put my money in a bank that's

2456
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:30,176
Screams at me about how the government is going to take my money away from that back

2457
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,968
Wright also is this

2458
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:38,368
Independent Bank don't be involved in the FDIC if you're telling me that you want a social network started

2459
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,696
Trump without a f****** daddy billionaire

2460
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,048
You know what it's a little incoherent

2461
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
It's all a little

2462
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,192
Functional is like his plan is functionally let's secede from reality

2463
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
Tireless

2464
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,568
We can't leave the country cuz we a flan

2465
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,360
But our brains cancel

2466
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,408
We will create

2467
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,480
Media ecosystem what you've already done a lot of a

2468
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,504
Lake work on with

2469
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,552
Infowars

2470
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
And Trump has

2471
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,392
Certainly elevated all these things

2472
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,160
What creates

2473
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,696
Online spaces for us to

2474
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
Interact

2475
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:20,864
You know what this would remind me alot and I don't think Barnes would like it

2476
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,680
If This Were an actually enacted

2477
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,496
I think it would remind me more of like

2478
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,592
The mining towns in the 1890s an early night

2479
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:31,616
1800s where

2480
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:35,712
The guy who owns the mind also printed your money for your home

2481
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,248
Ran everything there

2482
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:43,648
Printed the newspaper I'm not positive that Barnes wouldn't like that I mean that's not a musically libertarian Fantasyland

2483
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,976
I think a lot of people would love it if they were the owner of the mine

2484
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:50,560
See that's that's what you saying yeah and that is

2485
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,840
I'm going to get my own mind

2486
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,936
I think people like barns

2487
01:48:56,192 --> 01:49:02,336
And Alex are at 11 of society where they view themselves as being okay

2488
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:12,064
Be the person who runs the mind or somebody who's an associate of the person who have to buy an ass

2489
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,624
Reminder

2490
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:17,184
Obviously that's

2491
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,720
The society that they would like

2492
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,768
To see if they would like to build

2493
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,048
I'm going to tell you right now

2494
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
A society built around people who don't

2495
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,144
I want to work in the mine but I'll want to own

2496
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
Not a good one

2497
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
It's functional

2498
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,544
So Barnes said most of it is

2499
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,080
Complaining about qanon which is

2500
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
Becoming annoying

2501
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,872
At this point

2502
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,176
Until he leaves and Alex

2503
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,224
He said this like a pretty excited

2504
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,552
There's a short compilation

2505
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
Compilation limp calling for

2506
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:49,696
Reprogramming re-education camps of the American

2507
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,768
People tell Alex is going to play that compilation

2508
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,304
You know I was curious

2509
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,096
Cuz I hadn't heard him play those clips

2510
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,120
Somebody keeps talking

2511
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:00,448
About it so I decided what I was going to do is I was going to look into

2512
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,216
To each

2513
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,240
Clip to it

2514
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,520
Here's the deal

2515
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:07,104
I took this compilation clip by clip I found the contacts for

2516
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
For each of them

2517
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,688
But none of them really had anything to do with pudding

2518
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,480
Conservatives in camps or anything even

2519
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,040
The clothes I was thinking like what the f*** is going on

2520
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:20,928
I spent a long time sorting this out and then at the end of the compilation it didn't matter cuz Alex said this

2521
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,256
American people

2522
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:29,376
Go fuc yourself I wasted so much time

2523
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,912
Sorry

2524
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,984
Sorry it turned out the compilation that I was talk

2525
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:40,128
I think about doesn't exist that's the equivalent in my world of slipping on a banana peel

2526
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,664
That's Lucy holding the

2527
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,736
Ever and ever

2528
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760
But but

2529
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:48,832
Charlie Brown

2530
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,624
Alright

2531
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
So many

2532
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
Brainwash

2533
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
Educate

2534
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,024
Chill

2535
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,304
Firing squad

2536
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:00,352
Reprogram

2537
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:03,168
Show what are the clips about re-education can

2538
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
Abigail's.

2539
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
Harvard now what is setup

2540
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,056
Kind of weird

2541
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:13,408
Education camps and moral rehabilitation centers

2542
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,480
And institutions for wedding people

2543
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:20,576
Who had the chutzpah to work in the Trump Administration

2544
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:24,160
Criticizing

2545
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,440
Glad post

2546
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,512
I got to be criticized

2547
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,816
Barnes is still around but who cares

2548
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:35,424
Alex breaks into the air interviewed say that he didn't find the clips but unfortunately

2549
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,216
It's not a life they're saying they want to play

2550
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,240
For conservatives and cap

2551
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,312
Just another right-winger complaining but his fear that left

2552
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,896
Yeah this is noted Epps

2553
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:47,968
Steven lawyer Alan dershowitz complaining about Harvard

2554
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:52,576
I'm starting a petition to encourage the school to not hire anyone who work for the Trump Administration

2555
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:57,184
This doesn't help Alex's point and guess what that's a clip from November's

2556
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,232
The durrschmidt allowed on TV

2557
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,256
I don't

2558
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:06,656
I don't know but that's what I find really interesting about that is that Alex is supposed

2559
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,960
Italy in possession of hundreds of the eclipse

2560
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,240
He breaks in

2561
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,520
With this clip

2562
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,080
After playing the wrong compilation

2563
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,896
I don't know if he has over here

2564
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920
There are not

2565
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
Cuz they don't eat

2566
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,760
So Alex's

2567
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:22,784
Kind of bored

2568
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,064
Because

2569
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
Inauguration really isn't that big of a

2570
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:32,768
And also was shorter than he thought it was going to be half but I didn't make any real serious gas

2571
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,328
And Alex has a little bit disappointed

2572
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:41,984
All right I didn't Air Attack should happen any time something happens turn your phone on brother so much

2573
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,056
The others should have been

2574
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,592
Text anytime

2575
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:52,992
Pretty sure he's very disappointed nobody attacked the capital or around the country if some other

2576
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
Or something

2577
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
Pretty much like

2578
01:52:56,064 --> 01:53:02,208
That's the whole reason we were going to do an all-day thing as I thought

2579
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,256
Volkswagen come on man

2580
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:09,376
So it goes on a little bit longer Alex's spinning his wheels there's nothing really going on

2581
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
Is very boring

2582
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
Volkswagen

2583
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,128
On 20th

2584
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:28,064
Stopped it from happening b b

2585
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,648
So what's so awful

2586
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,696
Alex's Matt Bracken

2587
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,024
I noted race war predictor

2588
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,304
Matt Bracken

2589
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,328
Noted

2590
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,912
Shawty diagram fan that bracket

2591
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:47,776
Noted ebook about race war salesman

2592
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,800
Matt Bracken

2593
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:52,384
Yeah he's on the two of them have a largely unproductive

2594
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
The conversation

2595
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:55,200
I think Alex is so bored that he just leave

2596
01:53:55,712 --> 01:54:01,856
Safeway is during his interview with Jason Jones

2597
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,392
You're doing a half hour

2598
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,976
You take care of this until Ojon Rapaport shows up

2599
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:11,328
That's great and I don't give a s***

2600
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:14,400
John Rappaport shows up to host the fourth hour

2601
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,936
And this is where I turn things off

2602
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:22,848
Okay hello everybody John here

2603
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,152
I thought I would celebrate

2604
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,944
Lady by Janelle duration

2605
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
Bye

2606
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,808
Putting myself in a virtual Loft

2607
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,624
As you can see behind me

2608
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,672
Virtual City

2609
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
Betty Jean virtual locked

2610
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:39,744
Down

2611
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:42,048
And my refrigerator is stocked

2612
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,328
Virtual food

2613
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
Because it was

2614
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,168
Of course a virtual

2615
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,704
Inauguration

2616
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
After a virtue

2617
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,824
Election Gala Zoom background

2618
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Riveting stuff

2619
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,664
I can't believe how boring

2620
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,992
The most bored I have been

2621
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,040
So fast in the shortest

2622
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,064
This. Of time

2623
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,136
35 seconds for him to explain me to go to zoom background

2624
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,672
Brutally bought

2625
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,208
Terrifying

2626
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
It

2627
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,536
Yeah yeah it makes me it makes me mad

2628
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Yeah

2629
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,888
I think that I could have probably kept going

2630
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
And listen

2631
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,448
To the war room

2632
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,008
Although that's not a show that I normally listen to

2633
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,824
Owen Shroyer is basically a less competent

2634
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,640
Broey version of Alex

2635
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,432
And I just

2636
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
What are you

2637
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,528
Got to buy the end of Alex's show was this

2638
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,808
Sort of sense that

2639
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,600
They're all disappointed

2640
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,928
There's no real new talking points being developed

2641
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:41,696
In terms of like

2642
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,232
What happened on the 6th

2643
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,024
Yeah president

2644
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:47,840
Wooptido this is all exactly the way they've been

2645
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:48,864
Going

2646
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,424
I didn't I didn't have any faith that is looking to develop a net

2647
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,960
Anything interesting

2648
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:55,264
Simultaneously

2649
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
Did there was any chance

2650
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,616
That Owen show could be any more defensive

2651
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
Then the American Turner

2652
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:03,456
I don't think that there could be anything

2653
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,504
The top of that in terms of

2654
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
The dangerousness

2655
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,576
The offensiveness

2656
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
The bigoted nest

2657
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:11,904
Banality of it

2658
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,464
The banality of it was such a

2659
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,280
Terrifying part it's always the scariest

2660
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,304
Just like

2661
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,584
To kill millions of people

2662
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,120
Like it just tossing it off

2663
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:21,888
Yeah yeah

2664
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:24,192
And so I kind of felt done

2665
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:26,240
With Inauguration Day

2666
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,800
Outrageous White

2667
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:29,568
Nationalist

2668
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,128
Supremacist flash neo-Nazi

2669
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,176
Be content in the morning show

2670
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,200
We saw Alex

2671
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,992
Disappointed that his

2672
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,040
Bombings and false Flags

2673
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,064
Didn't come through

2674
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,856
And therefore he had no content

2675
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,648
On his own show

2676
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:44,928
I just

2677
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,744
Infrared showed up

2678
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
So I was.

2679
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,560
I think we got what we need

2680
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,328
Needed out of it

2681
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,352
I think Alex

2682
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:56,448
Definitely didn't get what he wanted out of it which was no a lot of terror attack

2683
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,752
I do think that I was

2684
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,520
He was kind of hope

2685
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:00,800
Open for

2686
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,080
You say we're going to do

2687
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,872
If you're Infowars

2688
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,664
And you're saying we're going to do a live

2689
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,432
10 hour Broad

2690
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,248
That's not because you think the inauguration

2691
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,272
Going to go well

2692
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:11,808
Do you have legs

2693
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:18,976
Some analysis or

2694
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,768
Find the setting out for any

2695
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:23,840
First hundred days you really want to get down to the nitty-gritty

2696
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:29,984
You want to get in the weed want to be a policy wonk Toledo policy wants to know that

2697
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
Firefighter show

2698
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
Girl

2699
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,664
I don't think he has the ability to nor the interest in it and his audience

2700
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:42,528
Be at all motivated by an Infowars we want spectacle

2701
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,808
Everyone explosion

2702
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
And apparently

2703
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,112
We want

2704
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
A dork

2705
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,952
Yeah I guess so

2706
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,744
Will be back

2707
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,792
Probably on Friday

2708
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:58,144
I think for another episode maybe a bonus little thing on Wednesday

2709
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,704
But

2710
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,032
The Fallout of Alex losing his Supreme Court in Texas

2711
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Appeal

2712
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,848
Which I think will be

2713
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,408
Maybe interesting

2714
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:14,016
Open tell them Jordan a website on

2715
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:21,184
We are important I was just going to go to bed Jordan

2716
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,744
Please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area

2717
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,512
To do

2718
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,424
I got bad news for you Harrison Smith

2719
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,472
You have attracted my attention
