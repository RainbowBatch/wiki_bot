You still even told law enforcement that private property laws part of the people

120

00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Number 7

197
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975

198
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303

Are you conducting a cigarette I don't know

201
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,823
He has told us a lot about where he was all the way up until 9:11

202
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Very suspicious

203
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
So real dry

204
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Just giving the name

205
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Even find some

206
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Google

207
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Deceased

208
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Gcct

209
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
I don't know what that is

210
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Hey that's a great f****** show hometown

211
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Great

212
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
No he's not we saw him live

213
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Nothing

214
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
So do only reason

215
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
I want to play that and another

216
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Describing his resume

217
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Is because

218
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Interesting to gear

219
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
His voice

220
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
He's talking about this so dispassionately and almost just would have liked

221
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Laying out names of

222
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Places and then like

223
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
Years I was there bought that I've got.

224
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
Right nothing in there's nothing in it that indicates

225
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
He's drawing from memory

226
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
It's almost like he's memorized a bunch

227
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
He's just kind of reciting

228
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
Yeah you know like the way that you memorize your your bio all the time and you say it repeatedly to any

229
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Come to the point where you have it down as a roach

230
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
I am dead

231
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Starbucks

232
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,495
You know I was like

233
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
Goddamn words episode

234
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,503
Hillbilly

235
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Sing like that

236
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Guess what

237
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Esai Morales

238
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Colors talking about like you know in Russian

239
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
And the guy sprayed up does no Russian

240
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Conversation

241
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
It was such a good moment

242
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Remember it

243
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Play radio never expect the hillbilly

244
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
He'll really demonstrate some sort of talent beyond what a hillbilly should

245
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
He busted out some Korean at any place.

246
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
You know Korean but

247
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Cannot prove

248
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
But from that resume like I said

249
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
To be a memorization

250
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Part of the brain

251
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Does feel that way from the way

252
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
I meant beyond that

253
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
From what

254
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Describing I could just a like

255
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Maybe you were a trans

256
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Insulators

257
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
4 something

258
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
And then you're putting on a bunch

259
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
These departments that he's describing

260
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
Department of Defense is never going to be like

261
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
This guy is lying about working here

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Because then every time some

263
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
I'm out and said that they work there that after

264
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Either deny it or that would prove

265
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
That they did work exactly

266
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Game that they never get into that blows

267
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Any kind of seek

268
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
His

269
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
Entirety

270
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
The Department of Defense

271
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Yeah yeah yeah

272
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
I mean it sounds more like you just worked

273
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Translator

274
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
I mean but it sounds more like

275
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
He was translating briefing

276
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,023
There's a good chance about that and that would probably necessitates some level of clearance

277
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Shirts

278
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
There's an outside possibility he had to

279
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Some sort of low-level clearance

280
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
He's turned it into

281
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,663
Something else years of service

282
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
And then he left

283
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
Right before 9/11 but

284
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Because after 9/11

285
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,511
911 brodbeck

286
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Contractor

287
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
War right after 9/11 and wash

288
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
DC working on

289
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Road map

290
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
I was working for a company called Grayhawk

291
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,015
I looked into it I can only find a construction advising company on the

292
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Coast called Grayhawk

293
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
I don't know what you're talkin about

294
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,183
But any called critical node mapping

295
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
That actually sounds like something

296
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Construction Company would be

297
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Did knowing

298
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
What you want to know where nodes are before you start building

299
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
I don't know

300
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
They were basically working for CIA at 4

301
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
2 map of the United States of America

302
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
They're making a huge spreadsheet on all the areas

303
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
Anion and protected from terrorist

304
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
The note

305
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Mexico

306
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
America

307
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
And then in South America

308
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
My timer

309
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Southern

310
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
The man

311
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Northern command

312
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Stood up

313
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743

I don't know what's coming man we're just

315
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Alright because

316
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,703
I feel like what I'm hearing in our future is a command Civil War of some sort

317
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
I assume Northern command where's the blue

318
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,335
Sure Southern command which put him in charge of counterintelligence

319
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
4

320
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
South America and Mexico and the surrounding area

321
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Korean

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
What

323
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
What

324
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439

328
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Conspiracy world

Narrative

330
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Grayslake North cam was created in 2000

331
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103

Of like they were that part of a takeover

338
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Which you'll get to

339
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Next quit the South will rise again

340
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
So you know the language they stood up

341
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah is what I'm interested

342
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
Rebuttal question

343
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
About that very thing

344
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
The fuc

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,847
Manhattan area of responsibility

346
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
Free 2000-2002

347
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
Fair when they stood up

348
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
Canada United States

349
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Mexico

350
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Just want to ask you a question

351
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Northern command

352
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,519
You really been open for business yet and they were taking on their area of responsibility

353
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
So round to end of 2002

354
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,151
When Northern command open up for business again

355
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,015
United States of America officially physically invaded

356
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
The United States

357
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
With Northern man

358
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
So

359
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:41,023
They open up for business is like with a storefront operation did they start small and then

360
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,375
I don't want to work

361
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,031
Neighborhood

362
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,895
The United States basically invaded the United States through northcom

363
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
Yes in the United States

364
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Previously in 90

365
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
1063

366
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Started

367
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
I don't f****** know

368
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
This is just

369
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Very Baseline pay

370
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023

373
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
He says he's bored

374
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
We're getting a bit into the weeds

375
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
Resume which I think is really unimportant

376
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Yeah

377
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Laying this out

378
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Because

379
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Most of this is

380
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Completely on

381
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Falsifiable

382
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
No one's got no one from North Commons

You would think blue and gray somehow

387
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
You're welcome has great

388
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
You think

389
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
My friend

390
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Supposedly a contract

391
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,527
Doing high-level terrorism analysis

392
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Score

393
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
Speak Korean for Central Command

394
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,671
The north northern

395
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
She was he says he's around 1 that was happy

396
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Nose

397
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Picture of it

398
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
We are

399
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Invaded by the Department of Defense

400
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Skier in the United

401
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Who does who did you all report to

402
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Northern command

403
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,695
Northern command is headquartered in

404
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Join cheese

405
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
Are we talkin joint cheese

406
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
Work together

407
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983
One of them

408
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
When you were there under

409
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
I don't know who the Northeast man top guy was

410
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,135
General

411
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,720
General guy who was in charge of sex

412
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Around that but he was also like

413
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
Is directly involved overseas around if he was reporting directly to General

414
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
He is someone who would have gone before conch

415
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
General had to test

416
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Pacifier in front of Congress

417
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
The justification

418
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,992
Before the Iraq War at stuff like that

419
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
I don't know I did my research

420
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Big dude

421
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Military circles

422
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Use my direct

423
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
Supervisor or is my general

424
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,264
I think you probably f****** nose

425
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Dude

426
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Quick

427
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,224
And then just hung up and she's but she's doing everything she can to be like

428
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
President was

429
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
When this happen

430
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Real talk

431
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
When I was five

432
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
15/16

433
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
I knew who this

434
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,544
The district manager was

435
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Over our company

436
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,432
Even though they didn't have any like influence in my life at all

437
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah absolutely

438
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,552
I don't remember the district manager's name now but the CEOs

439
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
Bob

440
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Cuz you want to drive over

441
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
And he showed up one time

442
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
He was a lunatic

443
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
I think I'd also probably helps you out

444
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Even before you ever showed up at our

445
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Me working there

446
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,520
My point is that if you are higher up in centcom

447
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
And

448
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,408
Absorbed or taken over by northcom

449
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,040
You get a f****** know who the guy in charge of North ComEd

450
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,648
Especially if you think that that's what happened if you already definitely resent the organization

451
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
You're probably

452
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Figurehead up over it

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
So I don't believe a lot of this story

454
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Nathaniel Taylor

455
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Hillary took over northcom

456
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
Why doesn't anybody just ask

457
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Might as well

458
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
I do want to say that I don't believe any of Ronald fart

459
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Story so far

460
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
But

461
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
Credit credit

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
In this next clip

463
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,768
He blows 9/11 alright

464
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
I started diving into that

465
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Information and I found that

466
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
All the information from September 8th

467
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
13

468
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
This is him talking about when he come back

469
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Is a contractor

470
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
He's looking a top-secret material that he has no business looking

471
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,552
A felon

472
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
On this show

473
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
Human gestation

474
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Information

475
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,632
Project pretty sure it's a hard felony

476
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
There was nothing in there I could find about

477
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
What was going on

478
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,592
Few days before and a few days after.

479
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
So

480
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Reclassified it but

481
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
Yeah

482
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,512
My theory would be you that's on a very strict need-to-know basis

483
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Solo level contractor can't get access to that information until Kerry Cassidy

484
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
Pretty wise of the devil address hold on

485
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,384
Let's put that in another box you don't get the

486
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,224
911

487
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
You know you have a couple of days

488
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
To think about it you're like

489
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
I bet if we give every Yahoo

490
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Access to this information

491
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Where to get a lot of conspiracy

492
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
Right there

493
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
911

494
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
And you can't hide that forever

495
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
You can classify all the documents you want

496
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
But those

497
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
Especially

498
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Yeah

499
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Especially 17

500
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Years later

501
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
One of the smartest

502
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Detectives ever

503
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Shows up on

504
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Project Camelot

505
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
Organise that for sure

506
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,584
What I discovered in looking at that even up to the you know September 7th

507
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
What is that

508
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
Everybody who was involved in the

509
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Terrorist

510
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Terrorist you

511
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
Everybody was under surveillance

512
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Classmates with two of the people two of the Olympia hijackers

513
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
University

514
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
MacDill Air Force Base

515
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Leo University campus there

516
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
I would go to class at 9

517
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Want to finish my bachelor's degree

518
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
Around 2000 I finished it up

519
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,776
Second

520
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
Believe

521
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Level top secret clearance

522
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:05,856
And was a high-level Korean translator and got hired as a contractor

523
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
Do counterintelligence work at all this stuff

524
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
He didn't have a Bachelors

525
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
Which I know it's not impossible but I find

526
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Very unlikely

527
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
This is

528
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Look

529
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Street smarts

530
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Stroop

531
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Does he

532
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
They were used in the reporting

533
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,944
Going to get married

534
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Making Communications

535
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
We're using the code

536
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,280
Getting married recurring 20 we're off to get married everybody's leaving to get married

537
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,008
Mazel tov

538
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,664
Around the same time we would stand outside class weights for going to our next class we have a break and we would talk

539
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,248
And they were telling me how they were going to get married but they wouldn't give me any details

540
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,840
It was farthest thing from my mind for the 9/11 operation

541
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,424
I like the proper offer a second

542
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
Where they getting married

543
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
There's a very high likelihood

544
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
These were not

545
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
911 or anything like that

546
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
He just was in

547
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
It was weird

548
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
I'm guessing

549
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Is as likely as

550
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,744
But who knows

551
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
I started thinking about it

552
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
10 years later

553
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Even

554
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,312
What do you mean your conversations you had 10 years ago

555
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,176
With random strangers

556
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
Talking about dude

557
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Week

558
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
You shouldn't you should have been like

559
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,928
Do I have a photographic memory so I can do this this whole thing

560
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
I can pull it right away

561
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
Otherwise unreliable narrator

562
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
You can call all this back that would

563
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
A bit of a brat

564
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
Well there is one thing we know about it

565
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
I am so far

566
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
It's a very modern

567
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,368
He explains why his time as a contractor ended

568
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
I don't

569
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
If there's ever been a fish story

570
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
The National Security Agency emailed me

571
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
Depuy other analyst

572
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
Specific

573
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Problem

574
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Be back or solution or what my thoughts were

575
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,736
So I put together a point-by-point plan on a house too

576
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Stop terrorist activity

577
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,904
Any more terrorist activity

578
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
.

579
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Very simple solution

580
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
And then demolished

581
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
Security agencies the next day I got my Commander's office

582
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,776
Email out

583
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:41,664
You know they wanted information they wanted a solution

584
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,808
And then the next track

585
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
So I talked to Maya

586
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
My manager my contract

587
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Resign

588
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
Guy just solve worldwide terrorism

589
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
They got a fire in forest

590
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,336
That's rough now it's Tanner of that conversation

591
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Go back and look at the

592
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Which I do have access to

593
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,200
And I have a photographic memory

594
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
Sorry

595
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
Can't wait to go to the guy says

596
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Did you write this

597
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
Email and send it to

598
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
To the National Security

599
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Agency

600
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
He said

601
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
You know

602
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Can't run the world

603
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Well.

604
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Hold'em

605
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
You know that my aunt read created

606
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,336
That's crazy I don't know why

607
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
You know what else is crazy he wants

608
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,856
Anytime would be great

609
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:59,232
Not like because you came up with the idea and sent it to the NSA

610
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Just f****** come on

611
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Actually I think I am

612
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Is Alex Jones

613
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,704
Reverse

614
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Tell you what

615
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
Possibly is how he would end worldwide terrorist

616
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,088
This is a very simple solution

617
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
If I don't want him to kill all the

618
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
So

619
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
He has missed

620
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
Supposition I guess the Deacon and worldwide terrorism

621
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Which carries like a man

622
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
You know

623
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
Terrorism intentionally

624
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
That's what's up

625
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
Which leads today

626
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
They wanted me

627
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
So I told them I go fine

628
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm going to resign

629
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
To stop

630
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
If you're not going to implement this solution

631
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,192
I just know that you don't really want to and I can tell by the way they were behaving that they don't really want to stop terrorist activity

632
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
You probably know as well as I do that it's

633
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
It's an operation it's a money-making

634
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,664
Well it's also at you know it's it's the state

635
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
Arm of the state

636
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
Trying to put fear into the People by creating false Flags actually it wasn't supposed to say that on my YouTube

637
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
YouTube channel so

638
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Creative

639
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
No creativity can't say it

640
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
Supreme BFF

641
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:49,312
Because she got the

642
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Oh she's not even not allowed

643
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
She got in trouble because she had people on

644
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Berkeley calling

645
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
People crisis actors

646
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
About

647
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Particularly Parkland

648
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,392
Shooting tragedy

649
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Sushi

650
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Contextualize

651
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
And turned it into

652
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
I'm not allowed to say false flag on the show anymore

653
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
Which I would say

654
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Even if you literally weren't allowed to say false flag on there anybody was paying attention to be like

655
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
Oh you can't say FF

656
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,712
Abbreviated

657
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
No no don't

658
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
You scare the public by

659
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Follow Friday

660
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
Oh no I would never call them prices ha

661
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
But they are CA

662
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,608
You know what I'm saying they've got a good talent agent you know what I mean the government was trying

663
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Terrorize

664
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
Putting out the fire

665
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Fantastic Four movie

666
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
That is not that's not wrong

667
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Visiting King on for my neck

668
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
Why can't I finish a f****** book if this a****** cat

669
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,880
Before we go

670
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Terry wants to know like

671
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
You were a contractor with top

672
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
Top secret access you were clearly going through in like trying to find

673
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Information

674
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Definitely

675
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Outside

676
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Cuz of your job

677
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
Why the f*** are you snowed in

678
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
Sing like that you had access to all the information

679
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
You didn't become Snowden so how did that knockout

680
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
I started investigating

681
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,368
What's 14 Terry by the way

682
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Find out

683
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,232
Who killed JFK and I started looking through the top secret messages that I can

684
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Find

685
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
Where I was working

686
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
And this is why I was in Korea

687
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
So this was 90

688
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
394

689
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
95

690
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:00,384
I'm sorry to hear that

691
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
Start to sit through some of the Intel

692
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
Find out about the story for JFK

693
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,256
Cover story about what happened and who was blamed and it was basically

694
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Play pretty-much

695
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
The same cover story

696
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
So

697
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
I wasn't going to get the true answers

698
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Because

699
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
In the military

700
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
Information

701
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Compartmentalize

702
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
So

703
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
He didn't become

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
No because

705
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Top secret files

706
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
Anyway

707
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Well I was in Korea

708
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
And I had access to top-secret information

709
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,888
I was bored

710
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
You know like most people

711
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,264
So I just started looking into whether or not the government killed JFK

712
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,616
Go through all their top secret files and for some reason

713
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,176
Even the government's top-secret file

714
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
Say what the cover story

715
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:14,880
There's some sort of narrative consistency they're even in their top-secret files

716
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
Tell you the true story that's something of the implication of it

717
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,216
You're not doing a beta dump

718
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:36,384
Everything I found wasn't much anyway which

719
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
He's making this up

720
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
He didn't have access but he's pretending

721
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Strong theory about that

722
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Now

723
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
That no matter what you say

724
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
Even if you have access

725
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
To the top-secret documents themselves

726
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Conspiracy theorist going to

727
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
Crispy rice

728
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,192
There's no convincing somebody like this dude

729
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
That's what's going to happen

730
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
What's going to happen right now

731
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Is that everything

732
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
You're going to go very wrong

733
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Everything

734
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
So insane up till now what are we like 36 37 minutes

735
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Just being like

736
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,184
I don't believe your credentials

737
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
And that's not good enough for a Project Camelot episode

738
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
I need rafters

739
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Or I need something of that level

740
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
I believe it or not Ronald far him

741
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Delivers

742
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,848
When I resigned I immediately started writing

743
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
My first book

744
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
Second coming of the Messiah

745
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
Which way is

746
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
Autobiographical

747
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Reach that Tipping Point

748
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
Say wait a second this is wrong

749
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
Something is wrong

750
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm not going to take this anymore I'm just going to start doing something about it and I'm not going to be part of this anymore

751
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
And so

752
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,544
Emotion that I went through with that transition in

753
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
The story witch

754
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
In the second coming of Messiah

755
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
The story about

756
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
This person who decides

757
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
Save the world and come up with a solution

758
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Modell's

759
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,696
End to where we are now

760
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,912
Illuminati in the powers-that-be

761
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
I really think

762
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:42,336
Duration of

763
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
You're the one thing

764
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Israel

765
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Now

766
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
Cover story but I think the bloodlines

767
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Thousands and millions of years

768
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Is Illuminati

769
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,400
Black Power

770
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Steven

771
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
Pretend

772
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,056
Information information

773
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
I hate

774
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Because he's never going to

775
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
To say I am

776
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,552
The new Messiah

777
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
Oh yes

778
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,464
He's described his book as the sequel to The Bible

779
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Messiah

780
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
For fucksake

781
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
So is it is autobiography

782
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,432
He does describe it as autobiographical

783
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
Spell and the first part is everything leading up

784
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
To him finding out

785
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,904
The movie visit

786
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Even if it was free you couldn't afford it

787
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,448
Be the case in the book as well I didn't read

788
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Read the book

789
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,824
I think that he puts himself in character in the book but it

790
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
It's supposed to be here

791
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,224
Female character who goes to Hollywood

792
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
Two balls the new Bible

793
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
Or something

794
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
It's

795
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Wild

796
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
Clearly on at least

797
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Some

798
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Very real level

799
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Thinks he's the Messiah

800
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
No

801
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
There's a possibility

802
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
He's the son of God to per se

803
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
I think that you might

804
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
Using the term Messiah

805
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
To be like

806
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
I'm going to save the world

807
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Servexpress

808
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,895
Which I fixed

809
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Feeds into her

810
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Solution for worldwide terrorism

811
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Everybody do what he says

812
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,831
Which again will get you in a little bit

813
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
Not to be

814
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Badland

815
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
So why

816
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
If he is right White

817
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
Can you be more into

818
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,959
This isn't that was the most boring I've ever heard a person talk

819
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
Spoiler alert

820
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
Twitter

821
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
We won like

822
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Over

823
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Amanda

824
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Manny

825
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,063
April 21st

826
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
2018

827
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
One light

828
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
With that low of a social media presence

829
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:50,751
I feel bad about how traction weekend I feel great

830
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
The Messiah

831
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
So knowledge fight

832
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
The Messiah

833
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,783
Rick and Morty

834
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:11,487
That's his first book that he started writing 2016

835
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
But Carrie brings up here because

836
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
He's got a new book

837
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
He's working out

838
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,775
You're actually aren't you writing a book on a Bloodlines that right now another book

839
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,503
What I'm writing the screenplay and in developing it right now

840
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
All the lines of Destiny

841
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
It's about

842
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
These 13 major bloodlines

843
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
You're controlling the physical domain

844
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
We're also being controlled by the archons to work

845
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,887
Rolling them vibrationally

846
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:56,287
Demonology Satanism sacrifices ceremonies energy

847
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
The laundromat I want

848
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,151
He's not done isn't chocolate more about this book

849
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
His work

850
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Specifically non-fiction to her

851
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Busy

852
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,343
Real to him

853
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
He's like I came up with

854
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
The greatest

855
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,535
Bloodlines that are psychic

856
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
Controlling the world chat like that so

857
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:28,031
Physical world of course being controlled by the demonology

858
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,871
The Satanist what are the Angelic being

859
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
But they're probably

860
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,455
David Icke talks about the archon

861
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,039
I think they have come up on another Project Camelot episode

862
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
We've done

863
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
Feel like there's probably a

864
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,863
Vibration

865
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Cancel this group of bloodline members who are

866
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Assassins

867
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
For the different bloodlines

868
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,615
Decide to make a break from all of them is that

869
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,711
109

870
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,295
Concern is giving information to the different bloodlines

871
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
Uncertain timelines to manifest

872
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
Skorts

873
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Different

874
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
No assassins in their bloodline to go kill

875
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:29,471
Baking shipping to the timeline that they want and it's causing a lot of different Mandela effect

876
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
The story

877
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
So

878
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,407
That sounds like a cool

879
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,711
Story

880
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,903
I thought I thought the Google that we got from the earlier was going to be

881
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
That we're getting into her pool on bed lights

882
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
You're full of s*** dude

883
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,583
He is not having a good time

884
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Refuse therapy at

885
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
Do not understand the Mandela effect

886
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,031
No no I just don't understand how he thinks that makes any sense

887
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,639
No I mean if they can if they can move

888
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,991
Zurn so why do you need certain to Divine

889
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Which

890
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,623
Timelines are best for you if you can move between all timeline

891
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,231
Whenever you want because and all timelines are simultaneously occurring

892
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,839
There is a big spooky machine that exists in the real world and a dumb people are afraid of it

893
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:31,935
It lends you like a little bit of you know like

894
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Magical Realty

895
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Magical realism

896
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
Concerta hidebehind like

897
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
Causing people

898
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,319
Assassins to go create Mandela effect all over the place

899
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,647
Steam Bears I'm not sure what the

900
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
No don't worry about it

901
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
I'm worried because you're worried about

902
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
I'm not really that worried about

903
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Berenstain Bears

904
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Actually spelled

905
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
Maybe that's why they had that

906
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
Yours beginning of that clip my dude

907
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Because he wants to

908
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Inject some sort of like

909
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Real Steel

910
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
Into movies

911
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,799
Is the other Mandela effect

912
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,103
What was it Sinbad was in

913
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
Cuz I can

914
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Second

915
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
There's a bunch of kind of fun

916
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
Cuz they're like they do take a little party O'Brien

917
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Kind of remember though I don't

918
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Get it

919
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
At this point

920
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
Carrie is like

921
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
I know you are not

922
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Fight

923
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Need to know

924
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
If you actually

925
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Show Business

926
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,687
Because he's presenting himself as like I've made

927
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
He doesn't write books you write screenplays

928
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Cuz if you wrote the book

929
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,767
App for the best original screenplay Oscar

930
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
Andy Gibbs

931
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,239
I would say the worst answer I've ever heard from

932
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
Can you elaborate on how you kind of

933
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,687
Are you in the business seriously or you are you aside liner

934
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Where are you at

935
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,463
So I moved to LA in 2011

936
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
I started doing

937
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
Extra work

938
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:09,375
Movies and TV shows

939
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:14,751
Enjoying the Screen Actors Guild

940
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Member of The Screen Actors

941
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,895
Who keep calling here with his story but I want to

942
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
To point out the differences

943
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
Compelling story

944
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
Any story about the time he spent

945
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Top-secret work

946
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
Do you think Gage been this story

947
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
He's remembering

948
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
$3,000 to get my

949
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,535
Do the hundreds

950
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,911
That's his brain the part of his memory that actually has emotional

951
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
Intuit coming out and bring an X

952
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
Information cuz that's how human brains work

953
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
The rest of it

954
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Is memorization

955
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Gibson

956
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
Credibility

957
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
To the other parts

958
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,223
I just want to point that out very clearly

959
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,743
Play

960
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,863
Doing commercials are getting paid

961
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,143
Voice overs

962
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
And I was here in this floor

963
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
So I moved to LA

964
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Wanted to take it to the next

965
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
And then I realized that

966
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,943
I just had this

967
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
Produce and direct and right

968
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
File the paperwork

969
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,599
So that's what I did

970
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
Heard that

971
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,487
You don't want to try if you're going to write something you're writing for

972
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
You don't want to try it

973
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Your opinion

974
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:49,727
Do you want to just have some kind of a strong voice

975
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,055
I'm going to waste all of my spend all of my time

976
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
Grossing movies of all time

977
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
That's a very

978
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Appreciate movie

979
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
I want to be able to retain my voice

980
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
So

981
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
I decided

982
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
Hollywood and Vine

983
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,791
Woman who wants

984
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,351
Take down the global military industrial complex

985
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
Hollywood

986
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
The sequel to The Bible

987
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
Second coming of the Messiah

988
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
So

989
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
His book

990
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,127
Is in the movie

991
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,943
Sprung

992
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,039
Goes to Hollywood

993
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
Hey babe

994
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
Thor games

995
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
The sequel to the Bible is just the second

996
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,543
It suffered from the sophomore slump

997
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:05,759
The new part

998
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,135
If you got the gold the golden tablets

999
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,439
Forgotten books

1000
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,815
Lord of the Rings The Return of the King

1001
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,119
You do

1002
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
He got

1003
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,007
Within you got the prequels of course

1004
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
You have other

1005
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Just text

1006
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,127
Yeah I forgot you got sumare

1007
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,223
So this guy

1008
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:42,879
A little bit late is a little bit behind

1009
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:48,255
Clowning on him for like being an extra

1010
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
I'm a little bit

1011
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
I'm being extra if you like

1012
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,679
Just want to do it to have fun or

1013
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,287
You know if you want to try and see what it's like to be on a movie set that sort of thing

1014
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
I think there's very valid reason

1015
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
Think it's something

1016
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
I think that is something that most

1017
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
People in it

1018
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
Don't be as a viable path

1019
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Towards beginning

1020
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
Further entertainment

1021
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,135
Maybe just a little something you do as like the way I smell blood

1022
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,743
I don't think that's going to make me a phlebotomist

1023
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,535
I have a

1024
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
He's expressing

1025
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Sort of

1026
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
Until he decided I

1027
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,543
Start out like

1028
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
And then from there

1029
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
What is filmography

1030
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
Hey did you even IMDb

1031
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
I just use on Imo

1032
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Maybe I'll pull it up

1033
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
I think it's

1034
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
This movie

1035
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,375
Live TV on America's Got Talent

1036
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
Guinness World Records on Wild

1037
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
Drummer is that right

1038
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:13,503
Summarize the drummer in some bands when I was earlier in the military when I was in high school but

1039
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,807
I actually was just

1040
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:22,463
Cruising Craigslist one night when I saw this ad for a talent casting director

1041
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,279
Wanted to know if you could do any of these different thing

1042
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,095
Can I play college baseball and I still play baseball

1043
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,679
A picture

1044
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,687
Send it to them

1045
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
If I could break the

1046
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,367
Record the world record for hitting the most number of people in 1 minute

1047
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
You look like you have

1048
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
Something on your tongue

1049
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
It's come out the mouth

1050
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,935
He's there plunger the people because he picked baseball score

1051
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Logical

1052
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
Magical uses a challenge

1053
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,591
Arranged

1054
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,895
Locomotion of throwing a baseball

1055
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Not the same

1056
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,783
Do you throw a curveball you throw good punter that's an old thing

1057
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
It's the same as

1058
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,743
Semillas you got to go over-the-top then you got to make sure that your brother

1059
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Did somebody

1060
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Testicular back

1061
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,583
I would say that it better

1062
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
Credibility as a

1063
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
Or something like that

1064
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,847
Seems like that would apply across a wide range

1065
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,503
So he was on America's Got Talent

1066
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,183
Who is the world from thousand years of Torment that we have existed

1067
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,743
The next ten thousand

1068
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,095
He was on

1069
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
Even Jesus blew it if you'd

1070
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,479
Kill that kid

1071
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,391
This guy's a mere babe in the eyes of the Lord it was weird

1072
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,439
Jesus through a plunger through a kids back

1073
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,279
He's trying to break the record at the time was Zero could Plunge

1074
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
Guinness World Records

1075
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,103
In America's Got Talent

1076
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,175
Do that on America's Got Talent

1077
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,759
The book with

1078
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,807
Someone who hired me to write a book and

1079
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,111
Howard Stern

1080
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
Howard Stern that would be help us get financed to get on his radio show so

1081
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,559
Another

1082
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,703
My friend from Pennsylvania we were on America's Got Talent

1083
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,287
I gave Howard Stern a copy of my book or our book

1084
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,943
Crazy Journey

1085
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
Okay but

1086
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,111
That's the right response

1087
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
Had you

1088
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,655
Department of Defense

1089
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:47,007
I guess JFK I would say 9/11 was your butt

1090
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,823
And you throw plungers now I would say

1091
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,479
Larger part of the show

1092
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
Very little to do with him

1093
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:06,975
Specifically

1094
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,583
You trying to get funding for his f****** movie oh that's his goal

1095
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,935
Farnsworth

1096
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
PT Barnum

1097
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,079
Ronald

1098
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
This dude

1099
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,711
I don't know how to talk about this

1100
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
Because I ate

1101
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Tubi

1102
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,575
Groupon necessary

1103
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,671
They go on about tractors

1104
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,279
The tangent about how he was homeless

1105
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
For a bit

1106
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,607
Because we're making fun of

1107
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,423
It might lead us down a road where we're making

1108
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
In front of homeless

1109
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,567
People unnecessarily

1110
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Sensitive

1111
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
And not mock him for

1112
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
For being homeless

1113
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
If he were homeless

1114
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:04,319
Insisting that he was there I would have far more for him than I do now that I know he is not home

1115
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
And the other thing is that you

1116
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
You have to listen

1117
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,951
Entire long jump

1118
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,999
Make the point

1119
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,327
There is no point does he actually described being

1120
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
About living in a friend

1121
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,727
Kitchen for a little while which is not ideal Circa

1122
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
Struggling actor

1123
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
Write my point is

1124
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
That

1125
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,151
I do want to make fun of him for being homeless

1126
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
But I do want to make fun of him for what he says

1127
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:38,111
I was shooting on some TV shows on the TV show

1128
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
Catering for my stuff my movie

1129
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,351
Let me move into his garage for like 450 a month

1130
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
The welcome in East LA

1131
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,311
Everyone just happened there

1132
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
He's a racist

1133
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Traditional

1134
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:13,439
I would like a better what's up

1135
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,839
So that's when he tried to do the caption you get it wrong the first time you just reshuffle man give it another go

1136
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,167
I didn't want to live in East LA

1137
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Become

1138
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
Project Camelot

1139
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
Right

1140
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,991
Expressed discomfort with minorities

1141
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
So in this

1142
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Jordan

1143

1147
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
Clip

1148
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,863
After the races part though now I feel like he's going to call it the final solution and I have problems

1149
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
This clip starts with him saying

1150
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,007
Was looking into the solution

1151
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
Got it

1152
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,335
There's not much before it that helps make it makes

1153
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
911

1154
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,663
9/11 not involved

1155
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
B like

1156
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,391
He's the Messiah and that he was a extra an autobiographical

1157
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,927
Movie Bessemer

1158
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,695
Bible

1159
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Vape juice

1160
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Be enough

1161
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
For me to do this episode

1162
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,959
Gets to the solution

1163
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Okay

1164
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Man-o-man

1165
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
This is bad

1166
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
Wednesday

1167
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Scary monsters

1168
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
I think this is

1169
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,759
Dumb

1170
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,999
One of the things that's a part of it is the promissory note

1171
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:58,655
Video about the promissory note I started looking at houses

1172
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,703
Except for value bills

1173
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
Doing research

1174
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Our

1175
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,199
It's really our vessel that carries our soul around

1176
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,063
Everybody into a bonded moditi

1177
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,135
And we have an account that we can use and we can accept

1178
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
For value

1179
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:28,351
So I was looking at trying to bring down the government and say we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve

1180
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:35,775
He's a sovereign citizen

1181
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:42,175
Hold on hold on it gets so much

1182
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,503
My reality show

1183
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Things like that

1184
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:55,231
Concept of the promissory note

1185
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
Making his own promissory note

1186
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,679
I'm doing the research based on on that video

1187
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
Was that the Federal Reserve

1188
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
Is it Corporation

1189
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,335
United States of America corporation

1190
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
United States

1191
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
Which is not the United States of America that the United States

1192
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,247
Series of countries

1193
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,783
That we all call States

1194
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,855
United States of America corporation

1195
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
How to deal with the Federal Reserve operation

1196
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,279
Two forces to use the Federal Reserve Corporation

1197
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Promissory note

1198
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:40,543
Whatever whatever

1199
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,663
Search

1200
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,319
Operation operation

1201
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,391
Unless you remove yourself from that whole situation

1202
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
Uncapitalized

1203
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Facebook

1204
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
Write your own promissory note

1205
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
You want to autograph it

1206
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
For value

1207
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,359
Except for they're committing the felony of MS

1208
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
Honda

1209
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,151
Public office

1210
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,967
That sounds right

1211
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
So you make an offer

1212
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,487
Honorable in court

1213
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279

Accepting accepting

1215
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Your offers

1216

Shortboard

1217
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,151
Promissory notes

1218

1226
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
It's still.

1227
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
I look this up

1228
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
Credit Union

1229
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,471
Is clearly who he is

1230
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,943
Wikipedia

1231
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,831
Because it's the pollution

1232
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,903
You got to see how it plays out at work

1233
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,351
Deposit

1234
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:19,263
And this was something that was punishable that I was doing it was fraudulent

1235
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,295
Then they would come knocking on my door and then I would say

1236
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Credit Union

1237
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,207
My account

1238
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:45,119
Did she Financial Officer resigned probably coincidence

1239
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:50,239
Donald Trump

1240
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
Space Coast Credit Union

1241
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
How many misconduct in public office

01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:07,903
My promissory note they shut my account down at Financial Officer resign

1243
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
How'd that go

1244
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:20,959
Get out tender our promissory note to the bank deposit feed numbers into our account

1245
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,927
Somebody would have come to my door and said hey you know you're under arrest

1246
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
Broad

1247
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
Sir

1248
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,327
That's the solution

1249
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,911
Everybody right $2000000 promissory note

1250
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
Autograph them do cellular numbers in your

1251
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,407
Solution is still we get Federal Reserve

1252
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
I think this is the first time that we've legitimately had Carrie bring somebody on her show

1253
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,111
So she could laugh at how stupid they are

1254
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:16,511
I think she's having a good time

1255
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,423
Junk on this idiot

1256
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
Duncan Bridge

1257
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
Silence

1258
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
It speaks volumes

1259
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:37,247
I didn't get that two million right now

1260
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
That's

1261
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,367
Went to the CEO

1262
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,143
Promissory notes are real

1263
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
Pam Bondi

1264
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:03,103
Promissory note

1265
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,503
Crime

1266
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
Is because there's nothing being done

1267
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
You know like if you

1268
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
He was trying to do this with that like

1269
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,183
The crime that will end up catching up with him

1270
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
The money he still owes

1271
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,047
Yeah usually that comes back

1272
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
The bank I've written a fake check

1273
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,191
They can just throw them in the trash

1274
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:37,151
It is a crime and then you start to use that money which is

1275
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Dumb witch

1276
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,247
Kind of brings us to our next

1277
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,527
Quit

1278
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,599
Because that's what Sean David Morton did to the

1279
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:51,231
We talked about it on the recent episode Sean David Morton

1280
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,791
Frequent Project Camelot gas

1281
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:57,119
Supported his income and

1282
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
I bet

1283
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
Deductions

1284
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,543
Order to get millions of dollars from the government

1285
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,591
Because until they look over it

1286
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,663
Through the cracks you could fill out a complete

1287
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
Reedley fraudulent

1288
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Text return

1289
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
And there's a decent

1290
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,039
It might go through and you met

1291
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
Might get a giant check

1292
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:22,719
Yeah we're like maybe 35 years and they just

1293
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:29,119
Depleted the irs's staff so you might get away with it for a long time

1294
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:34,495
Everybody listening is defraud the government

1295
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,591
Audits are scary because

1296
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Because some people

1297
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
We'll miss

1298
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,943
Report stuff

1299
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
You report accurately because

1300
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,271
When did

1301
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
If they find something like that

1302
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
You are

1303
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
F***

1304
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,231
They're going to be mad because

1305
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Tavares

1306
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,815
Especially when they're four large

1307
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
I'm not accident

1308
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,399
They're intentional defrauding

1309
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,983
The government which is what Sean David Morton is now in prison for

1310
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:11,871
Now interesting later Let It Go prisoner Dan they don't have the authority to do that

1311
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,711
Broad and Ronald

1312
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
Is not fraud

1313
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Is because

1314
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
Get me money from

1315
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,183
But only because of the bank

1316
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,815
Not going along with it the attempt is there

1317
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
But

1318
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,751
Malicious repeated attempts

1319
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Surprised they can come out

1320
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:46,175
Maybe

1321
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:52,575
$200 anybody good laugh

1322
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
Houston property

1323
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
But

1324
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Is really important

1325
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:04,095
Jamaica because now Carrie is going to be like I need to tell you

1326
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,679
You should be careful with that because Sean David Morton to prison

1327
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,031
Financial advisor

1328
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:17,663
Dave something would like 30 grand herself

1329
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,199
She's not against

1330
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Plan

1331
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,295
She just passing issue

1332
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,087
Doing it opens you up to

1333
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
To the government

1334
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,511
Very much misrepresents mashonda

1335
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
You're doing this

1336
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
You filed these

1337
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,191
Whatever you want to call it promissory note

1338
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,031
And he literally got thrown in jail for

1339
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,895
Kind of a similar thing in a way

1340
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:00,415
What is the chargemaster IRAs and what a sham that is in gyro tab

1341
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,487
Get all done his value or whatever it is

1342
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,839
I don't quite get it but you know a certain amount of money

1343
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,655
And they accepted it believe it or not

1344
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,703
Payment for his taxes

1345
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,519
And then they turned around and said he

1346
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,103
Literally

1347
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,199
For money they owed him or some

1348
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Something and they

1349
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Paid him

1350
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:31,135
And then they turned around and said no they made a mistake and he was responsible for their mistake and stuff

1351
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:35,487
They put certain counts against him

1352
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:40,095
No no no it does not take a twitching of logic

1353
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,375
For you to be like

1354
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:45,983
Oh yeah you like that money isn't real and then you took so

1355
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,847
It's not a we made a mistake on our end it's that the mistake was you were allowed to do that

1356
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,919
Ever

1357
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,831
Transaction

1358
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:05,183
You committed fraud we didn't look

1359
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
Hey

01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,487
12 million dollars back

1361
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Something like that I don't know

1362
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
Defraud the government

1363
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
Even the government like

1364
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,519
We're fine with it if it's like a little bit

1365
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
I would imagine

1366
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
I mean

1367
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,639
You got to think about real resource allocation

1368
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
The guy isn't making another movie

1369
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Ronald

1370
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,295

1374
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
Genius

1375
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,807

You're talkin flat-earth baby that's fun

1393
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,199
We know from our last epoch

1394
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807
Plenty of them

1395
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
He better predict

1396
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
I would say that

1397
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
Right up there with them

1398
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,719
We are headed

1399
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
For the

1400
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
What Albert Pike

1401
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
Putting his

1402
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,607
Surono

1403
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,679
Don't do that

1404
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
And it's going to

1405
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,775
Tire world

1406
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
Hopeless

1407
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,663
Stricken

1408
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
Samurai

1409
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,967
Fearful

1410
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:41,599
Not in the position where they even

1411
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
41 Albert Pike Road

1412
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,695
Is turn toward the luciferian.

1413
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
Bring me to Messiah for him

1414
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:57,727
Preparing icing for a fake alien invasion

1415
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
I don't know if they're going to have

1416
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
Global war on terror

1417
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
Blow up so much that it turns into a

1418
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
Small nuclear war

1419
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
Sure

1420
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,503
Georgia guidestone

1421
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Are out there

1422
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
The first commandment

1423
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,623
Is to maintain a population under 500 million

1424
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
The Georgia Guidestones are out there

1425
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
This guy

1426
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,719
Out there

1427
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,255
This guy

1428
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,071
Is really drawn from the hole

1429
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,495
If anybody is ready to write a sequel to The Bible filled with as much b******* as you can cram into one

1430
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:35,103
This is the problem with people having

1431
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:41,503
Free access to the real

1432
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,063
Let me Google weather

1433
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:49,951
Memorize that generals

1434
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,767
Databank in general

1435
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,375
The thing is I want to unpack the idea of this fake

1436
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,191
Alien invasion

1437
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,519
Suggested that possibility

1438
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,847
Together in a new one world government we have to unify against

1439
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,687
Does alien menace the only way human beings really your night is whenever there's a

1440
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:14,527
Common enemy well now him bring a good sup on Project Camelot

1441
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
Kind of problematic

1442
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,879
Because Carrie believe

1443
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,999
Well that's what he would have to be a fake alien invasion

1444
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
But see here

1445
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:32,703
And I would say that in terms of the alien invasion well it's going to be a little difficult

1446
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,519
Because you know I would say

1447
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
That is

1448
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
It's kind of hard to conduct

1449
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
Alien

1450
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
Invasion when you got a real one going

1451
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
Stop

1452
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Booyah

1453
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,783
Saudia.

1454
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,111
Like a trio of

1455
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Close to dump

1456
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,463
The first one

1457
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,839
Do you know my whole thing is about that there's aliens already may be eating people for chocolate

1458
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,399
All the time like

1459
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:08,799
Maybe the Parkland shooting was really just covering up people on Carolina

1460
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
Yeah

1461
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,711
That's going to be tough

1462
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
Right now

1463
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,039
Quick thinking on my feet Jordan

1464
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
I'm saying

1465
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,647
That's why it's so easy to

1466
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:30,047
Invasion

1467
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
Even though the living amongst

1468
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,423
To safely unsafely

1469
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:40,031
We need

1470
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Fake invasion

1471
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,151
ShopRite

1472
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
Epic point

1473
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Ronald

1474
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,807
I assume he doesn't come back with that

1475
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,135
That sort of his AI

1476
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,695
Empath

1477
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,279
I asked you that question

1478
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,631
Bad baseball players

1479
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,911
Del Sol

1480
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,239
Because that's what it was now Ronald's going to get back to

1481
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,287
Slam his solution

1482
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
Yeah which is just Auburn citizen

1483
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
I can get unlimited money

1484
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,944
Promissory note

1485
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,992
And so he has a

1486
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,320
Everybody we're going to be free

1487
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,600
The evil central banks

1488
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
No no no

1489
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:32,256
The promissory note is accepted for value

1490
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,608
Then there's no reason for most of the crimes that people are incarcerated for

1491
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,936
I want to also say really quick to visit a good argument for Universal basic

1492
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:44,800
Muddy the waters with that sort of

1493
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
Reasonable thinking

1494
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,128
Nobody's going to go out

1495
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,200
Because they don't have to because they are they have their wealth

1496
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,016
You're not going to have to go sell themselves or sell drugs

1497
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
Make sure that

1498
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
Something like this never happens

1499
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,632
Obviously

1500
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
The numbers

1501
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Okay

1502
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,384
You know whatever

1503
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,296
God I Am Legend

1504
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,832
It's still not great

1505
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,368
So

1506
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,672
We have spent so much time

1507
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
With the most

1508
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,256
Credible women

1509
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
In the world

1510
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
To hear her credible

1511
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,888
Credulous

1512
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
Hear this level of

1513
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,336
I know you're dumb

1514
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
And I don't think you know your

1515
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
From her

1516
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176

So I have no choice I mean

1582
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
I don't feel hypocritical

1583
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,248
I have to do what I have to do

1584
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,808
And I'm not afraid to be uncomfortable

1585
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,464

1591
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:02,336
And you've already done the promissory note doesn't work

1592

She tries to go to the audience

1600
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,536
Because she's live stream

1601
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,376

1604
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Lot of nonsense

1605
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,544
You think

1606
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
It's a good idea to raise your vibration

1607
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Hypocrisy

1608
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,760
Kerry Cassidy

1609
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784

All right so there's a lot of nonsense going on in the Chatham sad today and so I'm
