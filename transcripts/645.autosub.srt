1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important items swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
The altar of Celine and talk a little bit about the past present

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
Future of Alex I like in A Christmas Carol

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Rango chains dangling

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,712
Yeah sure

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
I guess I have very little proof that I'm alive

10
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
Hey Jordan

11
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,488
I will

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Whatsyourprice

13
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
My bright spot

14
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,656
Just before the show Dynasty Warriors

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,544
I had no idea that they were Dynasty Warriors games available for the switch but

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
I found one

17
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
I've not played a Dynasty Warriors game since

18
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Since

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
The PS2 era I believe

20
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
That it's been quite a while

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,416
Maybe a decade or so

22
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,280
And sorry I started playing a little bit of Dynasty Warriors 8

23
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
And

24
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
It's

25
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Good job

26
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
That's wonderful

27
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,264
My bright spot is

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
So about 30 years ago

29
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Godspeed You black Emperor

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Recorded

31
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
The demo tape

32
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Of which

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,040
33 copies were made believe is the number

34
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Couple of days ago

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
The first time

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
It was put onto YouTube

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
First time in thirty years

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Nobody even thought this

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
This thing even existed anymore

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
And we have a full hour

41
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Wow

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
That was only put on 33 cassette tapes

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
That's pretty wild

44
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Yeah it's crazy

45
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,992
Do they want it to be out it's not their business

46
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
I think

47
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
It did very interesting thing is like a document

48
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
The demo tape

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
I don't know

50
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
Yeah I really meant for public consumption

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
That was it was released as a demo

52
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm 33 copies of play was for the exact

53
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
Get a record deal like not put it out I don't know LOL

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
It's really good and especially cuz it's a 1990 f******

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,184
For whatever and you listen to it now and they are they're not fully formed is godspeed yet but your

56
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
It's just blowing you away just like what

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
This is 94

58
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,168
Still as relevant today as it was I don't know you tell me

59
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you have that too

60
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
To enjoy

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Today we are going to put Alex in timeout

62
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Good last episode that was

63
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
2000 enough for a while his casting monster might be relevant

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Midterms coming up that's true

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,720
Take a look at something from the midterms

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
In 2040

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
See where Alex's had was at during that.

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,471
Free Trump right so happens if he will

69
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
It doesn't happen

70
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
The day

71
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Oh

72
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
The election the midterm election November 4th

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
2014

74
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
How much is gas

75
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,807
Is the most important person in the world Tucker Carlson

76
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Really

77
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Goddamn

78
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
So I thought it would be interesting to look at

79
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
The Dynamics of the midterm

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,863
In 2014 and also see how Alex related to the most important person in the world

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
Before he was the most

82
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,407
This is a camo Modern Warfare

83
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Disseminate

84
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
But first Jordan that say hello to

85
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807

I hope my neighbors enjoy hearing Jordan's laugh as much as I do because I play this podcast on my Bluetooth Soundbar

91
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Your nail polish

92
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,687
Much but also this podcast should be something you listen to in private headphones

93
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,015
Noise cancelling

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,647

Risen above

100
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Miami

101
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
So take a little break now

102
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
A list for me

103
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
And then we're going

104
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
To come back

105
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
And I'm going to start the show over

106
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
F*** you

107
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
I got plenty of words for you but

108
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
At the end of the day

109
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
F*** you and your new world order

110
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
She rode in on

111
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
And all your s***

112
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Nostradamus

113
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

114
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Belle walk out of here tomorrow

115
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
And you never see me again

116
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Really what I want to do

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Back here again

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

119
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

120
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
I'll be better tomorrow

121
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
Who knows about tomorrow but let's see if Alex

122
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
Who's better in the past

123
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
He wasn't sure isn't

124
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Today Show

125
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Just a little bit what

126
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
Does the tiny bit of identity theft

127
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
Did you know that a lot of people call themselves Alex that's a tiny bit of identity theft

128
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,279
I never really thought about identity theft is like a thing of an amount

129
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
Yeah it was just kind of thought like wild people have got your private information.

130
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Pics of my social security numbers I'm real

131
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,359
Playing with tonight's now if you look it's less of like a little bit of identity theft and they did a little bit with it

132
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Yriv

133
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Yeah they bought gas one time

134
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
So are we start here on the

135
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
4th and

136
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
No

137
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
You can see a little bit of the same sort of conversation that Alex has around a lot of Alexa

138
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
It's always the most important thing and it's a political realignment to every single time this political realignment have

139
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
I like the sort of who gives a s*** level

140
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
It's accurate

141
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
Yeah but he's trying to over grandiose things a little bit

142
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
Actually probably something

143
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
In a both parties are a little bit guilty of

144
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
You here are you here

145
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
It's okay

146
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Before it's

147
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
It's sensible to say that every election is

148
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
The most important one

149
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Because it's the one you can

150
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
10 impact

151
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
Past elections there might have been more important

152
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
Like things on the on the Alexa about it now

153
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
You can in the present one

154
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
What's the point of me

155
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Being developed hate then

156
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Look this isn't the most

157
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
An election the most important election

158
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
What's 18/6

159
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
That helps you write

160
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Put things in perspective

161
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
This empowers you a little bit because

162
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:19,615
Most important action should be the one which you have an ability to impact

163
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
So I'm just kind of trite but

164
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
It's sitting in an election both parties have been like man

165
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
Not much going on this you want to see

166
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
So Alex is destroyed Obama

167
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
Basically his buddies have

168
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
Taking them down if you want to go.

169
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,727
Presidential election

170
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Barack Obama

171
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Secret Life

172
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,847
Yep that you can track to every election right

173
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Throw this out there

174
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Where I mean

175
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,783
You know that's actually something that's almost been kind of nice about the 2020 rewriting

176
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,135
Narrative been illegal immigrants

177
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Deb Wright

178
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Is the right Boogeyman this time

179
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Summer

180
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Well it is all of us but that is also the elite

181
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,191
Quote immigrants part of the storyline

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
Really that's true that you get from Alex's

183
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:56,895
Especially was before the soda narrative solidified a little bit more

184
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
You can see this is all this is

185
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
Really boilerplate

186
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Now this episode gets races

187
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
That's really fast

188
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
How quick you might have

189
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:12,767
Smelled a little bit of it's coming in with the illegal voting

190
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,607
But man I was not ready I came into this just look

191
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Looking for election coverage at Tucker Carlson

192
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
I did not expect for Alex to go

193
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
So hard so fast that clip of Joe Rogan saying the n word a bunch

194
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
Little version

195
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Organizing

196
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Walgreens

197
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Earworm

198
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,663
I feel like that's a really good encapsulation of Alex's delusional position about integration

199
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
He pretends to be as a no problem with non-white people existing in the spaces around him but at the same time if he sees a few minor

200
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Doherty's in a store

201
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Besides without any proof that they're all here illegally and it's part of an effort to flood the country

202
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,839
Overwhelming to see more than one non-white person anywhere

203
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Crazy

204
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
This feature of Alex's racism of Muslim women

205
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Pool supply shop

206
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,639
Alex he's not white people or people of other cultures that he's hostile to

207
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
Living in spaces that he's decided are

208
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
R4 White

209
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
People in it bother

210
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
You can hear this being expressed in the way you saying that they were just

211
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,671
Too many minorities at this Walgreens that he went to is it to imply that

212
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,279
He's a good tolerate white person who put up with one non-white person being at the pharmacy

213
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
But there's a line

214
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
If there were three.

215
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
People at the same time that's evidence of a f****** Invasion obviously has literally zero information about

216
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
These people that he sees at

217
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Other than that he can tell that they're not white

218
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
And maybe he can hear them speaking in languages other than English

219
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,527
From that he determines that they're not supposed to be in the country and that their presence

220
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
As part of the conspiracy against white people in my

221
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
That's sick s*** and it's something that I was perfect

222
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Play comfortable expressing

223
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Is it fact he's making legitimate point about some

224
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Political position that he has

225
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
It's sincere

226
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
He has no information about the citizenship status of any of these

227
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
He has no information about whether or not they're immigrants

228
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
He has no information about whether or not they even

229
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
The only information he's operating on is that they're not white

230
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
And being around multiple non-white people makes Alex's white identity

231
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
And the power that he feels

232
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Entitled

233
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Because of that identity

234
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Yul Brynner

235
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,463
Honestly Alex has a way worse person now than he seemed to be in 2014 but this articulation

236
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
What is deeply entrenched racism is

237
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
It's probably more explicit than he

238
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
He gets into today

239
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,215
Yeah you know it is nice that the one

240
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
Single ideal of America that is unimpeachably grape

241
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
The idea that anyone can come here

242
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
And make themselves alive

243
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
Is the thing that they hate more than anything else

244
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
They'll hold onto the image

245
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
What makes us so great

246
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,559
But also if there are a bunch of minorities around non-white people

247
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
That I

248
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
Victor something up

249
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
I think it's a conspiracy okay

250
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Here is fine

251
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Fine here's my new rule

252
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,359
No Walgreens can have anything less than an exactly demographic

253
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
A representation

254
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Of America

255
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
If there are more than 60% white people

256
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Walgreens closes down

257
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
What about CVS

258
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
They're racing

259
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:28,511
I feel like implementing of your system would be incredibly challenging and I imagine

260
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,375
If there would be a lot more non-white people in his Walgreens that's for sure this guy sucks

261
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
This was weird to hear

262
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
So fast

263
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Looks

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
The story is so

265
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Trite

266
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Like its

267
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
It's it means nothing

268
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
His experience

269
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Is

270
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Just that

271
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
You think there was no fight there was no like

272
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Conflict or anything it was just he's experiencing

273
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Of what he determined to be too many non-white people existing into space

274
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
That he thought there should be more wipes

275
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Man

276
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
I can't believe that

277
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
Because I've you just go there and you see it but that's what I would

278
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
This will blow my mind is like seeing that all of those people from everywhere in the f****** world in the same place

279
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Knowing that if I

280
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Flu anywhere

281
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:21,247
If I flew to any country in the world I would see an infinitely more homogenous place

282
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
In that Walgreens then I would hear

283
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
That's the amazing thing

284
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
We're obviously a great Melting Pot that is Walgreens

285
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Absolutely.

286
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah anyway

287
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
Alex Williams from this into

288
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Maybe

289
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
White supremacist talking points

290
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,223
Forgot

291
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
I'm not speaking hyperbolically when I say that this is some Stormfront s*** yeah

292
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Boards and

293
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
It relies on the same underpinnings as the great replacement kit

294
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Conspiracy theories that inspired Mass murderers like Brenda

295
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Parrots in the Patrick crusius

296
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,895
This is 2014 Alex long. Any connection to the community and

297
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
How above the left-right paradigm

298
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
The game was always to present yourself as being against both parties

299
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
To trick people into thinking that you're in the middle while

300
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
In reality you're just trying to

301
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
Suspecting politically disillusion people towards the extreme right

302
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
And opinions like this

303
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,327
This is bad this is the game maybe we've gotten it wrong

304
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Maybe he has always been above

305
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
The left

306
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:53,055
The left-right Paradigm interesting slip-of-the-tongue there

307
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Yeah

308
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Yeah I mean I guess I guess you could

309
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
Say that he is above the left-right Paradigm in as much as

310
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Pisces

311
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
Nowhere near it

312
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,951
Sepulveda politics whenever all I really want to deal with is how racist I am

313
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
To really have a lot of power behind

314
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
You to say that I'm really again I'm way off of it I would like to use its power to inflict harm

315
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Small government

316
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Until it can be used in

317
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,943
Enforce my white nationalist ideology

318
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,295
I want small boots

319
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Exactly

320
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,695
Listen to this November 4th episode and I got really really curious around this point cuz

321
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Alex

322
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
Alex's insisting that the media

323
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
He's done him dirty

324
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Right

325
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
There's a story in an rawstory

326
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Issue with the headline

327
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Really got my ears up

328
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
No you're not

329
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
Wait

330
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
What

331
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay okay

332
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
I'm Wild

333
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,904
Confused I think that I just have to leave a bit of that rambling to the side

334
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
There are people in all group

335
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Who like to beat up

336
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
People in other groups

337
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Predator ass baby

338
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Chat whatever

339
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,032
I am more interested in this rawstory headline and seeing

340
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
Just how accurate or inaccurate it is

341
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Because I am always curious about like

342
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Alex

343
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,504
Being misinterpreted or people covering him in the wrong way

344
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,856
I was just mad about this article in Raw Story which allows me to figure out

345
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
What episode the actual comments

346
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,488
That they're covering our Maiden so I can go back and I can

347
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Figure out and see if Alex

348
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Is right or wrong

349
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
Did this headline actually mischaracterize Alex's words or is he just engaging in the stupid racist backpedaling spin

350
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Justify is bigotry in Moline anybody who would say

351
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Call it out

352
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,896
This has to do with stuff that Alex and apparently

353
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
According to Raw Story on the previous day's episode

354
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
And here's what we will need

355
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Need to assess specific

356
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Alex has taken issue with the rawstory headline quote

357
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,208
Alex Jones Obama put out a green light for groups of black youths

358
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Kidnap white with

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,144
In the headline to put put out a green light and the black youth are the things that are in

360
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Jason marks

361
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Contention that this headline is somehow

362
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,824
Frankenstein mishmash of his words being used mischaracterize what he said

363
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
So this was saying

364
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,688
But it was on Monday's episode 3 episodes on Tuesday

365
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
So Gordon Raw Story

366
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
We go back to Monday

367
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Can we check it out

368
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
We can find out

369
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,440
So Alex doesn't get into this or commentary immediately so I was like what

370
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Might as well

371
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,072
Pull some clips of things that are interesting along the way here's one that's really stupid

372
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Real

373
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
Man enough to roast Alex I can just sit back and let his pants size do it myself on fire

374
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
Listen to him say that I can't do it

375
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Hurts me physically

376
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,168
Have to hear him say the things that I would

377
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Very casually say

378
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Yeah it's like

379
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
If I got

380
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,896
But I brought your past self

381
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,968
I can't count the number of times he's yelling about I like

382
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,528
The world leaders listen to him

383
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Cuz is the most important

384
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Analysis of world issues

385
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,928
Hey Brian stelter is no viewers of Cl that is fatal I called

386
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608
So there's one Hallmark of being a loser and then I made the other big Hallmark of a loser is like you know you

387
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
You do something

388
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
And then you lie directly to people

389
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
Faces that you didn't do that right

390
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Refuse to take responsibility

391
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,336
I like let's just think about how he hold on one second

392
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
What

393
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Are you telling me that

394
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
This clip is of him saying that

395
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
People

396
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Lie

397
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,832
Rather than engage with the thing that they did

398
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Okay

399
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
And then

400
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
Young tomorrow's episode

401
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,232
He's going to engage with the story

402
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
About a thing

403
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Maybe

404
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,144
We don't know we don't know yeah I'm telling you that I'm going through

405
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
Assess whether or not The Raw Story headlines

406
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Is accurate

407
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Even take medicine

408
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:54,432
Like the way he lied to Rogan's face but what he said about Sandy Hook a classic Hallmark of a loser

409
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,064
Department

410
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,952
I'm being truthful and taking responsibility didn't go well it's remarkable 22

411
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,768
We hear things that I think are actually fairly

412
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Acura

413
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
I think it is a loser is behavior to self aggrandize and minimize your enemies

414
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Go to Fantasy World

415
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Behavior

416
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
Kind of loser ish to not own up to past mistakes

417
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
And deal with yourself

418
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
Physically as well

419
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Totally

420
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
It's just it's just that

421
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,904
Alex likes himself could not be more and indictment of yourself Center

422
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
To coherently put forth an argument

423
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
That you are a loser

424
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,816
Calls November 3rd

425
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
Bird show

426
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Interesting idea

427
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
If you listen to this

428
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
You can tell that like Alex

429
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Love

430
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
And respect

431
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
The institution of vote

432
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Yes like

433
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
Heat sensitivity sacred Act

434
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
Or a race where

435
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,744
By the latest poll it's like over 3% one person over another

436
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328
How about people riding something that's

437
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Middle finger to the system Tennessee

438
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Alex wants to use

439
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,640
Voting as a publicity stunt

440
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
God

441
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Goddamn

442
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
That's just

443
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
That's

444
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Advertising you just can't buy

445
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
No you can't buy that you can

446
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,976
You can destroy a country with it

447
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah

448
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
That's ridiculous

449
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,912
Another call from a guy if this actually was

450
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
So this caller is discussing how he

451
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,056
Works at an apartment complex

452
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
And Arizona and

453
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
They apparently I've somehow

454
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Somehow

455
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,296
Are part of an intentional plot to bring in refugees and immigrants from Lake Liberia

456
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
Because they want to spread Ebola

457
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Complex

458
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
Arizona complex ownership ownership group

459
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,424
Trying to bring in seriously bring in people from Liberia and other countries in Africa

460
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
Aunt Deborah this is

461
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Lutera

462
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,568
Apartment complex

463
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
Brought in

464
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Cheer in the office

Liberia Africa

466
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Their own name on their own

467
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Everything

468
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Call Biltmore property

469
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
Chandler Village

470
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Seems like a lawsuit

471
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Kind of behaviors that Alex is in trouble

472
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Sandy Hook

473
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,496
Is this is the same behavior it applies

474
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
I mean

475
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
Bureau of

476
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
Acting in such a way that would lead to harassment of

477
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,344
People whether it's the people who live in the

478
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,648
Apartment complexes Refugee or otherwise

479
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
Or the people who run these apartment complexes you're putting people

480
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
At a risk

481
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,608
The ethical implications of having this guy

482
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,472
Say the name of the apartment complex I mean on the air is

483
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Is staggering.

484
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
It's so immoral

485
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
That

486
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
On this show

487
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
That all of these people are

488
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Immigrants

489
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
You've said that the owners of your apartment complex

490
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,904
Are assisting them to do nefarious thing whether it's to stealthily bring a bowl

491
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,744
American Horror

492
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
And then you gave me a

493
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,632
Yes and we're going to send some people

494
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,984
I don't know if I've ever seen Alex do this kind of thing before

495
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
For always

496
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,920
Relevant and worthwhile to point out something

497
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Behavior

498
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:49,088
Whether he's intentionally cause intimidation or harassment towards these people who

499
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
He feels our Act

500
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Magic in ways that

501
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
He disagrees with right

502
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
Or if it's just a lack of

503
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Concern

504
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304
For the well-being of people who will be targeted and harassed

505
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,888
I'll buy it either way it's the results

506
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
Are awful

507
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
I am creating it as a pattern

508
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Also makes it

509
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,800
A feedback loop where the more you

510
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,872
Tell people to go send we're going to send people out there

511
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
The more people are going to call in and say

512
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
I'm at Bubba Bubba

513
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Send people out here.

514
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
Exactly exactly

515
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Of his own

516
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
Accord say the name of the place

517
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Pacifically asked

518
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
Yep

519
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
She really was interested in the ad

520
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
Or wanted to investigate this further

521
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,608
You would have kept that off air

522
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Speed the

523
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
The possibility of something happening

524
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
From that

525
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Is is

526
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Most

527
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
Journalistic Outlets

528
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
Risk no I didn't Raymond just

529
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,736
F****** the idea of me living in an apartment complex

530
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Happily

531
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Just fine

532
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:58,208
And not having any idea that somebody f****** 34 hallways down the way is

533
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
Calling Alex Jones to give them my address

534
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,888
To put a bounty

535
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
Yeah that's not good

536
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
The comment

537
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
What's that Alex made

538
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
About

539
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Black folks

540
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Getting a green light to attack white piece

541
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Better alleged

542
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
Avance Raw Story article

543
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
They are in response to Ben Stein

544
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
He went on

545
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,392
Fox News and said that Obama was the most racist president in history

546
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,488
Yeah that was an interesting question on Wednesday been sent money to who's the most race

547
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
President history and then

548
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,632
Sarah Silverman

549
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,240
Oh I don't remember that Jimmy Kimmel after

550
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
Got number of Seasons yet

551
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,872
I think Cousin Sal

552
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Butterfield's

553
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,576
Sure why not was just thinking about this I saw that clip of Adam Carolla on Sean Hannity

554
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
So staggering

555
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
The different directions

556
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
The Kimmel in Corolla truck

557
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Could not be more like

558
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:08,096
The the dichotomy of our our future like when I was growing up

559
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
The idea that if somebody just sat me down while I was

560
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Watching the man showed been like

561
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
One of these will be good for you and wanting

562
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Will be boys

563
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
These guys will host a late-night show and

564
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,784
Have some socially responsible positions that he puts out and isn't the day

565
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Brightly

566
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
The other one

567
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,648
Will be an annoying monster

568
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,464
Just a real tragedy of a of a

569
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
Void where Humanity once was

570
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,352
Both would have gone that route

571
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Yeah that's what I'm saying

572
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
We're all fought the men should be allowed in Stanhope took it over

573
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,760
Stanhope was

574
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Fun

575
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,624
One thing comes full circle baby

576
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
Firestone away benstein maybe

577
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
These comments and that's what

578
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
Precipitated Alex's allege

579
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Commentary

580
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
EXO

581
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
Episode

582
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Alex brings up and Stein

583
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,752
But it doesn't say the things that rawstory was saying

584
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
So I listened to this whole episode

585
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,632
I got all the way through I realize The Raw Story had done Meador

586
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,728
Oh no it wasn't the right

587
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Patches of it

588
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Twice

589
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
Explicitly

590
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
These things on Monday

591
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
So I found the show from Monday

592
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
What they actually meant is that Alex

593
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Video on YouTube on Monday

594
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
But it was from his Sunday show

595
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
So now we got to start over we got to play this again from the top I feel like I'm deeply committed

596
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,216
Weather. Rostory contact

597
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,080
Isabella when I listen to the Sunday show episodes in the past

598
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
Did you can't even like email somebody to complain about it anymore

599
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah I don't need to issue a correction for house tour

600
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
Today we go to the Sunday episode

601
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,368
I think that word like we're a little bit more in the

602
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Okay

603
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
Call the day before

604
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
What

605
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,968
Do we have Alex

606
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,528
Instead of saying like I don't know if I agree with him but whatever

607
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
I think his argument here is really dumb

608
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
You can just leave that aside though like even if slavery was fine in the United States because everyone else was doing it we still

609
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,840
You should talk about it and try and undo the societal impact that it had

610
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
On black people in America

611
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,960
You should have blame is irrelevant and it's a distraction at this point it

612
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
It's really a matter of recognizing degeneration

613
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Degeneration

614
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Denied access to many parts of

615
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
The market in the economy

616
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,688
How these things have affected communities do this

617
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,736
And what we can do to address these problems

618
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Moving forward

619
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Make a more Equitable Society

620
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,392
Alex keep the conversation on the level of slavery wasn't that bad if you look at the world

621
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,232
Set the time because it keeps people distracted from the real reason that many of these conversations

622
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,304
Linger into the present and that is these generational

623
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
Deprivation

624
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
And I

625
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
But I mean that f****** f*** you

626
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,984
F*** you not you not you

627
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,616
Just because I got the episode wrong

628
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Both ways

629
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Yes

630
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
People were saying slavery was bad back

631
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
People have been slavery saying slavery is bad

632
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,256
Since we had slavery sure that we are that we are living in a world where it's fine for Alex

633
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
You just put that out there

634
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
And then for us

635
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
To just be like well it was socially accepted at the time as opposed to our rewriting our entire understanding of History to be like

636
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
1703

637
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
I think I think you make a good point and I'm glad you brought that up because I

638
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,248
Definitely true

639
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
Still is

640
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
But yeah it definitely

641
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
It's

642
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
I mean I mean

643
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
If there's a reason he makes this kind of an argument so absolutely and there's a reason that we still have

644
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,496
It is really scared of seeing multiple by the store and that's part of why our history is built

645
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Around the idea that

646
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
It was fine at the

647
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
You know like everybody agreed it was fine

648
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
The time so we don't need to focus on the

649
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
People who said it was

650
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,504
You could say baby putting us more accurately

651
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
There wasn't

652
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
These societal capital or the political will to do something about how wrong it was

653
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
About how it was

654
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
Perfectly evil right

655
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Yeah if

656
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
If people

657
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
And this is the simplest way to do it

658
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
If people

659
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
Took Pages out

660
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
Two of their Bible

661
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,312
Give to Slaves so the slaves didn't understand that the Bible said it was cool

662
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,152
To kill your slave masters you knew it was wrong

663
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
There's

664
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
It implies intent

665
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,064
Men's Raya is there there

666
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
So Alex doesn't just talk race nonsense on this episode he also gets into

667
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,560
One of his favorite sources

668
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Cuz I thought it was just

669
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Dumb

670
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
So hardcore ladies and gentlemen

671
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
What's going on

672
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Turning around

673
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368
Dynasty Warriors

674
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:11,776
This is really fascinating because it's the way Alex is trying to rationalize that like I don't come up here and say crazy stuff

675
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Bill Joy wired article is available online

676
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,040
New listeners just

677
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
The brief version of this is

678
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,928
That there is a passage in that article where Bill Joy is quoting the Unabomber

679
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:33,024
If this is the stuff that Alex has taken to be the

680
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,424
The consensus of billionaires

681
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
The Unabomber isn't

682
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
Is accurate to what hours

683
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
Text me announcement

684
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,896
That the global Elites have decided that they kill everybody off

685
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
So stupid

686
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
So now we get back to the over

687
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,088
Racism and Jubilee

688
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
About the downtown Austin

689
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Apparently

690
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
19 wipers

691
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,328
Ben's Austin a number of times like I've mentioned my parents live there

692
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
And I've been

693
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
Downtown 6th Street

694
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
I think

695
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Maybe it's more annoying

696
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Then anything else like

697
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
It's pretty loud

698
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
There's a lot people partying

699
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,640
Weekends in particular

700
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
Themed gangs of different races attacking white people like the Warriors arrows

701
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
A bunch of people dressed up in like baseball

702
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
All I wanted was a Voodoo Doughnut in the sky

703
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,352
There is so many goddamn roller skaters attacking base

704
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
The weird guy with bottles on his fingers

705
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
The case of this episode

706
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,431
Anthony gucciardi, anyway

707
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Western Star train

708
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
What

709
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
You will deal

710
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Coronavirus

711
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Okay

712
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
That we just heard a lot of anal parasite talking

713
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
You know it's always fun whatever Alex tries to like insisted he's not being racist in the middle of

714
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Committing a rhetorical hate crime

715
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,951
Yes I'm in the same situation as describing

716
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,535
Not necessarily things that I would describe his

717
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Is hate crimes

718
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,375
Per se

719
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
I think the real

720
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,239
Issue is that Alex just is he shouldn't live in a city

721
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,103
I don't think he's able to engage with and navigate

722
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
The things

723
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
They come with living in a city which is

724
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
You don't fortune that there is some

725
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,271
Structural shortcomings

726
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
People are

727
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Panhandling

728
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Yeah

729
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:45,279
If you take any time someone comes up and asks for a bunny is like an attempt

730
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
To mug you

731
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
I think that you're going

732
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
You should just live on a phone

733
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
Yeah or or you

734
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
You could go Hog Wild

735
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,055
And really get a lot of Groundswell behind the idea of taking money away from the

736
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Cops and

737
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
And giving it to the people

738
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Who are pants

739
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
I get out giving it to people who need social safety nets housing if you'd be good

740
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,831
There are two ways to solve it

741
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Kill everyone

742
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Or help

743
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
Live in the country

744
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,023
Stop living in Austin city

745
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,423
Dynamics and things that happen when you live in a city is a race-baiting globalist superville

746
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
So yeah you can't live in the city

747
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,775
Stories are a little bit

748
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,895
Vague for me to really operate on

749
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Man

750
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
The rash of gangs

751
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Going around downtown

752
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
What

753
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Okay

754
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
I guess I'm glad that Alex

755
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Didn't pack heat

756
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Might have

757
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,543
Committed murder I'm glad I didn't hear about the knockout

758
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:39,199
Oh yeah sure

759
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,015
Freddy's 4, taters

760
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,623
In 2022 it seems like it's almost like they just make these things up when they're

761
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,231
Kamchatka

762
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
What column which is

763
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,327
Alex had this experience

764
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Babe

765
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Dickies overdramatizing

766
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
Just a little bit

767
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,799
Anthony gucciardi one of his employees

768
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,639
He's one of these guys who exist in the space of like

769
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Helping

770
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Dr. group

771
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Sell his supplements

772
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
Vibe space

773
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,135
Oud totally showed up fairly recently

774
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,695
In 2014 and his tenure was not very long

775
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,767
He's he's not around the Infowars parts anymore

776
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
But apparently he

777
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,423
Some folks downtown

778
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,495
To kidnap his girlfriend

779
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,775
You're wonderful

780
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,879
35

781
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
That is

782
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:37,215
Outrageous so we still don't know where gucciardi girlfriend is in this story

783
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
The story necessarily

784
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Gucci already

785
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:43,615
I don't know if you Charities lying to Alex's house is lying about it I don't know

786
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
It does raise some questions

787
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
What is

788
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
That his girlfriend

789
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:53,343
Should have been kidnapped then right I think she's I think she's still gone beyond

790
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
The choice was

791
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,023
Give us your girlfriend or we will stab you didn't get stabbed and not okay you all are right

792
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
Imply that they took his

793
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
Girlfriend that seems like a story that I was with lead with

794
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
I mean that

795
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,287
Probably the biggest story that I could think of for for his purposes

796
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
Girlfriend

797
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,991
It seems to me that this story is nonsense

798
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
Because of the non kidnapping and Dawn stabbing

799
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,951
I don't know maybe Anthony Gutierrez got into a fight that's the type of s*** that happens in movies

800
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,999
What what what do you talk

801
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,119
What are you talkin about six men come up to you with one knife

802
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,191
Right

803
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,055
There's six of them making beat you to death in a heartbeat true if that's what they want to do don't need a knife

804
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
The ad

805
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,871
Well it's interesting that you say if they're sick

806
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,735
Is that number might be a little bit fluid kind of what I was thinking he was saying

807
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
And everytime it

808
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Yeah

809
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:34,463
Alright I've satisfied my curiosity.

810
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Rednecks

811
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
Never mind. Never

812
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
So I think the rawstory headline is absolutely accurate

813
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,543
Alex

814
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,127
Little mama green

815
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
Encourage this kind of s***

816
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
The headline itself has to do with a kidnapped

817
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:02,111
Thing in the story about Anthony Gucci Artis girlfriend was 100% And attempted kidnapping based on the way that Alex tells the story

818
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
SA

819
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
One thing

820
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Put out

821
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
Total fairness

822
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,143
It's super super clear that I was just trying to drum up feelings of fear about black man in his overwhelmingly white audience

823
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
If you go like

824
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,543
Super strictly on details there's one way he can still make a point Against The Raw Story

825
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Article

826
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:26,431
Their headline is quote Alex Jones Obama put out a green light

827
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
The kidnap white women

828
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,783
And if you listen to his telling of the situation with gucciardi

829
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,343
There isn't any reason to conclude that his girlfriend is white

830
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
How better headline was encapsulated

831
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Very over racism but not

832
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Not specified

833
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
The unspecified

834
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
Oguchi Artis girlfriend

835
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,351
From Alex's story all we know is that she's very attractive

836
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
But we don't know that

837
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
But she's white

838
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Haven't gone through all this

839
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,775
I'm going to say that the rawstory headlines actually overly fair to Alex

840
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:56,127
These comments are racist as hell and the placement of quotation marks don't really have anything

841
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
What to do with anything

842
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,247
But I'm satisfied now to November 4th

843
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,599
Election day and what's the number of people in this gucciardi story

844
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Was a little bit

845
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Fluid

846
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
This is from November 4th

847
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,167
Grabbing a girlfriend

848
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,447
Is absurd and it's not meant to make sense

849
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
Alex's Weebly

850
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,359
The story about Anthony gucciardi but also pay really close attention to the comparison

851
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
And he's making about racial issue

852
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:39,551
On the one hand he has some guy coming up to him and maybe aggressively asking for money and then walking off with

853
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
No real need for aggression or violence right

854
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,415
I was just didn't respond and he says the guy stopped off

855
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
How does imagine that this

856
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,743
Was done because the guy was black

857
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,327
Can Alex's white but there's no proof of this outside of Alex's imagination

858
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
It's very possible and perhaps even likely that this guy aggressively asked a black person for money that same night

859
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
There's nothing except for Alex's imagination that makes this a racially-motivated thing and I'm not entirely sure what the

860
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,687
Reality with the Gucci already story is cuz it's

861
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,063
Second hand in the details kipana changes by the

862
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
Fellowship of the Rings

863
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
This is being compared to racist

864
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Dragging a black man

865
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
The death behind there

866
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:25,375
Alex's referring to the 1998 murderer or you could call it even a lynching by truck of James

867
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
James Byrd Jr

868
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,495
Who carried out the attacks William Williams

869
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
Lawrence Russell Brewer and Shawn Allen Berry

870
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,455
Over three miles behind their truck

871
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,015
Before the killing they defecated and urinated

872
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
A killer

873
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
When does Man want the most

874
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
Disgusting and horrific ways possible they left

875
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,927
Does body in front of the cemetery of a black church

876
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Cookout

877
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,767
The killers were members and Associates of white

878
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
Supremacist groups were abundantly clear

879
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
I had like

880
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,887
Nazi tattoos and chip

881
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,495
Got the death penalty and have been executed the third got life in prison

882
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
For cooperating with the investigation

883
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,175
In 2011 when one of them was on the eve of his execution he told the news as far as any regrets

884
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
No I have no regrets

885
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
No I do it all over again

886
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
To tell you the truth

887
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
Even through all that the victim's family tried to spare

888
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
The death penalty

889
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,415
This is what Alex is comparing his

890
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
Experience to

891
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,535
Some guy yelled at Alex that he wanted money and then Alex stood there and the guy left

892
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,863
That's as much of a violation to Alex's what happened to James

893
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
James Byrd Jr

894
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,727
I guess booty already stories more severe with the threats about kidnapping but

895
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
Noticed that even though Gucci already was

896
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,103
Super outnumbered he didn't get sad when his girlfriend wasn't kidnapped

897
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,639
If that story happened at all

898
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,735
There's absolutely no doubt that burns murder was racially mode

899
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
That was an active

900
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Is very clear

901
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
The stories Alex's tell they may be real if I'm being generous but there's no indication that they were racially motivated

902
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,095
Black person bugs a white person that wasn't necessarily done because of racial animus but went three white supremacist

903
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
Because he's black

904
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,447
And then they say that's why they did it

905
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,495
It's a racially-motivated crime

906
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,311
The blurring of his line is an important part of Alex's

907
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,127
The political project which is rooted in white identity

908
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
He's a flake

909
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,735
Races that deserves if anything far more s*** then he gets on that front

910
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,831
There is something very specifically intentional about this train

911
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Compare

912
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Horrific

913
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
Very clearly racially motivated crimes again

914
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Black people

915
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:31,071
Do something like what Alex experience

916
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,399
Not necessarily racially-motivated because the equivocation

917
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
Is

918
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Leah Fenton

919
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
Absolute and giving

920
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
Bring the audience to equate the two

921
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Is

922
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,663
And embedding of racism in their mind

923
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
The dual purpose of

924
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,015
Inflating his victim status

925
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
Sun

926
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
Deflating the victim status

927
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
The victims of his ilk

928
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
In elf

929
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
Yeah it's it's

930
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
I'm so flipping

931
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
That comparison is something B

932
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,447
Just something how he understands these days

933
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:14,591
It's terrified absolutely no wrestling with the reality of being dragged behind a car

934
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Or

935
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
Why are who

936
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Yeah

937
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Well

938
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:24,063
Congratulations I think if anything's took you out of context

939
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
End of the opposite direction that you're claiming to me how often he seems to be f****** handled

940
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
With kid gloves Buy

941
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Locations that should f******

942
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
Both barrels Adams

943
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
I think I think a large part of that is its

944
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Really

945
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:43,263
Unpleasant to listen to his show and I think that most people would rather not do it

946
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,335
You know I think another part of it I was just thinking about

947
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
This recently

948
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
I think another part of it is

949
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,687
When I was thinking about.

950
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Describing

951
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Like

952
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,807
Oh this is what Alex said on his show if I

953
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,879
Really put that into like a headline

954
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,231
I'm something that we talked about on a daily basis that's totally normal to us

955
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
It would sound Faker s***

956
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Every time

957
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,351
I think that's part of the like

958
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:13,471
I don't know if it was fully intentional but that's part of the reason that like our episodes are just a date

959
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:18,335
Yeah is the title and the description of the episode is never really all that now.

960
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,639
Like a blade out all the details

961
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
I don't know why

962
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,247
With that that

963
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
That possibility

964
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,367
I mean what are you going to Alex famous

965
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
Christian Zealot says that we are energy beings vibrating between multiple dimensions

966
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,839
And that is how we'll accelerate our growth to the next

967
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
Play

968
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
What who's going to

969
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Don't break that

970
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,495
I don't know if anyone should

971
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Exactly

972
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,847
Alex's disgusting raises

973
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,967
Remember cuz I accidentally listen to Monday's episode.

974
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,551
We remember that Alex was doing that coverage of the apartment

975
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,367
Listen to

976
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
He has on Tuesday

977
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,951
Obama

978
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
Mortar

979
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
Apartment complex

980
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,711
He doesn't have anything to back that up on its own

981
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
Just clearly a reference

982
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,063
Call that he got from the day before that he's integrated now

983
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Into his

984
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
Factual based report

985
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Bat

986
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
I would bet pretty confident

987
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,303
Play bet the United States has imprinted 60 million green cards in at 6

988
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,863
That's an interesting question

989
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
Maybe yeah

990
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,775
I don't know but I'm ready to go right now

991
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
I was crazy how that worked out to

992
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,639
Yeah

993
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,479
Idea about you know you bring in all these these immigrants

994
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,295
And then they will all vote for a Democrat

995
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,367
Stuff on its face

996
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Even leggings

997
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
It's a dumb

998
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
Dumb way to engage

999
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
With 30 Dynamic right

1000
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,815
There's no reason to assume that immigrants who come in will automatically vote

1001
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,655
Other than if you are assuming that your own party would never help

1002
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,751
The real assumption there is

1003
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
We're never going to do any

1004
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,359
Looking for immigrants there's a projection of that

1005
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
Do you know he he believes that

1006
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
You're going to end up in

1007
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,015
The situation where there's actually just

1008
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
Direct

1009
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
And when you have democracy

1010
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:43,487
51b voting to murder 49

1011
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,047
His racist ideas about what'll happen to our voting

1012
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:52,447
He ends up talking about Greek democracy unfortunately ends up working my side

1013
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,871
Europe

1014
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
What

1015
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
Milkies

1016
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Olive Garden

1017
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
There are white rocks

1018
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:23,839
Look like in the air he's talkin

1019
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
I'm about

1020
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,447
Caveat Greece at the time was a bunch of different city-states

1021
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Too many of them operate

1022
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:34,591
Differently it's what I'm going to get into isn't a representation of the picture of actual like

1023
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
Panhellenic politics

1024
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,455
Also just to leave the side this thing

1025
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,247
You just talkin about ass

1026
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,063
Also if there's also an important factor

1027
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,623
Women and enslaved persons couldn't vote

1028
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,023
And sometimes the ability to vote will be passed on generationally and sometimes inability to vote had to do with

1029
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,143
Tyranny of the majority take this with a grain of salt

1030
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Alex is just talking about

1031
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,639
Do you have any idea about anything else that was going on now your city-state

1032
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:14,527
You can tell this because of the use of some specific words that he's using the very clear indicators of the ideas

1033
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:21,183
The sentence of being thrown off a cliff or drinking poison remains of capital punishment because I was using the term Havelock

1034
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
You can kind of get the picture

1035
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,535
That's where that's where the knowledge begins in it

1036
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,887
Democracy was rooted in the system of largely independent entity

1037
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,239
There was the Boule which was a kind of it was a body that included Representatives

1038
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
From all the tribes in Athens

1039
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:41,663
Then there was the Ecclesia which was kind of like our Senate infected they argued laws

1040
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,223
Maybe the House of Representatives

1041
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,575
Bad analogy

1042
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,975
You know I got you a sort of like a legal arguing body and then there was

1043
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
Stereo which was the Judiciary

1044
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,375
In addition to this tripartite executive branch

1045
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
Apps with three archons Farm in the council that presided over the city-state

1046
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,799
There was the pulley Marcos who was in charge of the military issues of the state

1047
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,615
The eponymous archon who is the chief legal figure

1048
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,431
In the zoo did B of the religious

1049
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:22,111
These positions were not democratically elected as we understand them as they were always members of the aristocracy

1050
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,695
And there was there wasn't like a legitimate vote to put anyone into

1051
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
Position of being archon

1052
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,631
If I what you were talking about elections of archons as being something that was really just a function of the In Crowd in the oligarchy

1053
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:37,983
That would be fair but that's not really true the broader popular votes

1054
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
It would take place within

1055
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,383
There were many things that all male non-slave not indebted Athenians

1056
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
Could vote on

1057
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
Then just the way that Alex

1058
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Describing with colored rocks

1059
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,783
Or often broken pieces of pottery called ostrich

1060
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:56,671
It is true that there are a lot of things like proposed laws that if Union were allowed to vote on

1061
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,487
But the specific stuff that Alex is talking about

1062
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Public votes

1063
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
Like he's very

1064
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,887
Clearly talking about Socrates and his Kyle was carried out by the dikasteria

1065
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
Like Socrates stood accused

1066
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Crimes against the state

1067
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,055
So his trial was a little bit more serious but there were often votes related to ostrich

1068
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Like where someone could end up getting banned

1069
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
Stream the city-state by a vote

1070
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
That's

1071
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
Resume comes from

1072
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,759
Africa the broken pieces of pottery

1073
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:27,903
This is a process though that was initiated by the appliance guy and then voted on by all voting-eligible public

1074
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,719
So that might be what Alex's conflating

1075
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,815
Ability to ostracize someone from the city-state is being conflated with

1076
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
Soccer

1077
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
Ortiz's trial

1078
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,143
Where he was sentenced

1079
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,567
I'm being a little bit pedantic but the point is that Alex is using this very flawed understanding of Athenian democracy to uphold his stupid

1080
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
Racist ideas about modern voting

1081
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Immigration

1082
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,687
But I think it makes it important to talk about a little bit

1083
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,527
If there's someone with an actual background in something from history that implicates

1084
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,831
Current day issues it's usually a good idea to

1085
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Consider what they're saying

1086
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,415
And that's the very thing that I was just trying to hijack

1087
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,279
He's trying to pretend that he knows things about history that give him a better understanding of things happening

1088
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
Present

1089
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:10,655
But everything is talking about is really surface-level at best and wrong it worse

1090
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Yeah it seems like

1091
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
He's learned literally everything

1092
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Scene from a movie

1093
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:17,567
Yeah or just maybe someone telling him a story about soccer team

1094
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
It's basically like

1095
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,455
You know the kind of told him the story about Socrates like I did read the Republic tonight

1096
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,319
Yeah or the apology would be the one about the trial

1097
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Lakeview

1098
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,159
It's kind of like the level of knowledge that you get

1099
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
From

1100
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
That broke

1101
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,511
Absolutely

1102
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Absolutely

1103
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
I got high I was talking

1104
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,679
And then I decided to remember that for the rest of my life has been

1105
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,519
Yeah I think I think there is

1106
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
Just a just a bad

1107
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Grasp

1108
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,943
History that I was using to apply to his ears

1109
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,479
How many just conceived

1110
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,271
More messy in terms of History

1111
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
Alarm

1112
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
It's absolutely of them

1113
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,039
True most ancient Greece

1114
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:35,135
Alex's just talking about Socrates and pretending that he has a larger understanding

1115
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
Greek socialpilot

1116
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
In college ancient Greek was one of my miners

1117
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,791
One semester was just translating Play-Doh

1118
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:48,447
Apology in English before like in high school and I understood the broad Strokes of it but translating the original text was pretty

1119
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
I opening

1120
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Experience

1121
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
For one thing in English translations it doesn't come across fully how much are they how much Socrates was absolutely

1122
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
Baking them

1123
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
The Killer

1124
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,967
He was suicidal.

1125
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,783
Just that he was too cocky assholes that he was showing as much respect

1126
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
Process

1127
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,879
Has Alex does to the depositions we've heard him in

1128
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,695
Literally most of it if I recall correctly was them being like

1129
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:13,535
Please just go away or shut up and he's like you'll have to kill me

1130
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,839
They're like no we don't want to

1131
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,167
The notably one of these

1132
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,495
Somebody has her punishment is like you guys feed me for the rest of my life

1133
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
One of the other things that really stood out was

1134
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
Exactly what Dynamics

1135
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,431
Existed that we're leaving to his trial in the first

1136
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:36,063
One of them was obviously the charge of corrupting the minds of the youth by way of questioning the official religion

1137
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
Just use of estate

1138
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
However there were other

1139
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,023
Princeton Socrates was super opposed to democracy feeling instead that the ones who knew best deserve to rule

1140
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:48,351
That he was carried out his people

1141
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Republic

1142
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
In terms of

1143
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
What Alex

1144
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,471
Since talking about like the opposition to the state

1145
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
Opposition.

1146
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,359
I was going to say Socrates was more like the philosopher king

1147
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,199
Style

1148
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
The pain of Play-Doh

1149
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,015
We get that

1150
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:12,415
Political aspect of the trial of a group of oligarchs called the 30 Tyra

1151
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
These dudes were pieces of s*** and they presided over

1152
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,559
The killing of between 5 to 10% of the Athenian population

1153
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,143
In a very short ruled they had there was less than a year

1154
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,519
There was an uprising that took them out of power in 403 b c and 4 years later is when Socrates

1155
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
I was tried and sentenced to drink a block

1156
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,615
One of the 30 tyrants was kriti

1157
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,639
Yes and associated

1158
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Socrates

1159
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,479
Who is this such a friend of his there's one of them

1160
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,783
Socrates his dialogues is named after him

1161
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
Eddie appears in at least two others

1162
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,927
Whether deserved or not the public was not hot on people who are friends with

1163
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
4:30 after their ouster

1164
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,535
And that may have played some part in the targeting of Socrates

1165
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
The trial

1166
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
Even so according

1167
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,887
The apology and the later dialogue

1168
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,191
Credo Socrates could totally is

1169
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,495
Not Benedict at trial and been given the lighters

1170
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,287
Or he could have escaped to Exile

1171
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
A very willing

1172
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
Do not go away

1173
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,127
Just go away

1174
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,175
Most Greek philosophers weren't killed by the

1175
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,759
Plato and Aristotle both died of natural causes

1176
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,111
Epicurus died of a urinary Stone and heraclitus died

1177
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
From dropsy

1178
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,463
This is an example of Alex's one of his favorite tricks

1179
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
Adversity takes a little piece

1180
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
Trivia that he knows about one thing

1181
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,375
How many pretends it applies to a broader context of any presents that is true

1182
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,959
I'm sure it's fun for him to kind of probably feels like

1183
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Like improv but

1184
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
It's just lying

1185
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,847
Who were philosophies who were thinkers

1186
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,943
Am in Athens is not

1187
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Not really

1188
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Held up by Lake

1189
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,647
Some of the more notable enlarger philosophers of the time I was surprised to read that they

1190
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Shots

1191
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
Epic

1192
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
50 this out of a trebuchet into the sun

1193
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
That was a surprise

1194
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:59,167
He was a scientific experiment

1195
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,471
Could be.

1196
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:07,871
That's not to say that throughout history there have been people who were like revolutionary thinker is that where Moline

1197
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
Before the Revolutionary thought

1198
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,503
But the way that I was trying to present this as it relates to philosophers

1199
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,551
Rain in the city-state of Athens

1200
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Is not fair

1201
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,647
He's just making sure. Because he knows a little bit about soccer

1202
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
Which I think is

1203
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Anyway

1204
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,583
Let's get back to Alex be racist

1205
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,799
Mirador

1206
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,335
Earwig

1207
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,351
Star Wars

1208
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Water

1209
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:28,511
Wow minorities around it's like the MOs Eisley Cantina

1210
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,119
First off that was a that was a

1211
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Bar is great

1212
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,495
The most wretched of scum and villainy

1213
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
Somebody lost an arm but that's fine that's exact just a good bar that characterization of it is it's

1214
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Awful

1215
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
It's

1216
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:53,599
Yeah but that's from that's from Obi-Wan point of view he was a real stick-in-the-mud fair enough

1217
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,743
I like that Alex went for the second stanza of

1218
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
You didn't stop there

1219
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:07,423
Wow rare that swinging jazz music dammit he's f***** up

1220
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
I just looked up

1221
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:15,103
How is the same person is like this Walgreens reminds me of the MOs Eisley Cantina

1222
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,503
How many non-whites are

1223
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:27,903
It'll come back up again of your thinking about going to see Planet of the Apes a hood

1224
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
The Tower of Babel you're a witch

1225
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Who am I

1226
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
Yeah we just talked about the town not on this episode on our previous episode of remember how you get into space

1227
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
Oh yeah you're breaking into a world we live in

1228
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,543
Facebook

1229
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,383
Break my glass ceiling

1230
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,431
This is this is f*****

1231
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,711
That's insane

1232
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,991
That's just insane

1233
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,527
Especially because

1234
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,647
Again I have never Associated ball-sized lie with any kind of racial component I was just like

1235
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,975
It's what is it at all so that's the cool part of space

1236
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,279
Turn the entryway purple aliens

1237
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:11,679
Everywhere that's what I got excited about what I was a kid not according to Alex

1238
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
To meet all these aliens

1239
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:18,847
It seems like you're leaving that aside I don't disagree with you but

1240
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,663
Largely expressing support for ethnostate

1241
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:26,271
Strictly a I am not a white

1242
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:31,135
Supremacist I'm a white nationalist and the black Nationalist and

1243
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Because race is not a

1244
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,303
Constructed every group every race should have their own State and that because if you have to

1245
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
I don't understand how you can defend himself against

1246
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:45,215
These accusations is like you are awake

1247
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:51,615
You want you got scared because they were too many non-white

1248
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
Play really interesting to is the distinction

1249
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
Between this like

1250
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:58,783
The pool supply shop

1251
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:04,671
He doesn't like to see indications that Muslim people can actually engaging

1252
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,231
In culture normally just like everybody else

1253
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
That was threatening to him

1254
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,303
In terms of that

1255
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Function of

1256
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,423
Integration

1257
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,983
This is a little different

1258
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
Even inasmuch as it's like

1259
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
It's not about seeing

1260
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
A lot

1261
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Of one group

1262
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
Seeing

1263
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
A lot of

1264
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
See ya

1265
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,247
Of different groups

1266
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,575
Congregating together that's that's wrong

1267
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,367
Really weird about it is

1268
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
The

1269
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
The number of different groups

1270
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,535
It's something that any of itself is weird and threatened again

1271
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:46,399
No this would be like bizarre this would be legitimately if like

1272
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
In Star Wars

1273
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:54,847
Luke walks into the MOs Eisley Cantina is like segregation now segregation forever like what

1274
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,407
Are you doing

1275
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
2

1276
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,807
The Alex get to call about voter ID laws

1277
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
Shorts

1278
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
Fairly interesting

1279
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,183
I should say that a large portion of the show that a sedative

1280
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Duck lips

1281
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,535
Kind of Edibles bores me as a position that Alex has

1282
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,839
Yes but it's very much in support of voter ID laws

1283
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:21,215
Very much like he's ever going to get rid of voter fraud

1284
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,239
This this called

1285
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,263
Struck me as bizarre

1286
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,639
Voter today

1287
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,687
Florida

1288
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,015
And when I went in there

1289
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,279
Defiance against voter ID laws is being encouraged

1290
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,071
This is weird

1291
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Well

1292
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
I mean think about it this

1293
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,983
Really the Walgreens example it's so so f******

1294
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
Metallic

1295
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,335
Because here's another thing that you could have in the Walgreens right

1296
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
All white people

1297
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
Okay don't white people in the Walgreens

1298
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
But

1299
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:39,039
There's one person from Ireland who doesn't speak English he only speaks Gaelic

1300
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,599
There's one person from Sweden who doesn't speak English

1301
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,999
Because they all look white and if they are not talking Alex will go in there and be like at all

1302
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
And in the same way the voter ID laws

1303
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,351
You just look at his face is white

1304
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
You don't need you don't need an ID

1305
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,935
Right

1306
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,215
I think the assumption

1307
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,519
Is that Alex believes himself to be talking

1308
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,799
Come to a white collar

1309
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,103
And so it's not such a big deal

1310
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,175
That this person needs to be subjective

1311
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
It's weird 100% the case

1312
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,271
It's so glaring

1313
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,855
But most of the show has been so in support of voter ID laws

1314
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
And then this

1315
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,487
Where this guy is saying like you have to show me the law where it says I have to show my ID or whatever

1316
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
It's it's it's

1317
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,839
Yeah it's disorienting you're just in

1318
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
But

1319
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
Unsurprisingly

1320
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,679
Immediately after this

1321
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
Experience with this collar

1322
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
Deeply racist

1323
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,423
I bet the jaw-dropping Lee racist

1324
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,495
That is like

1325
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
Here you go

1326
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
I'm going to have you

1327
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Vote on this

1328
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,967
16

1329
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Notebook

1330
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:18,879
A special value Cannon real special ballot and you just have to go to the center of the ocean

1331
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,951
Oh my god wow

1332
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,975
Hot Springs

1333
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:29,375
Saying that out loud isn't totally normal on Alex's show

1334
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,935
It's not something that causes him to be like

1335
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,519
Did you say something did he say how dare you

1336
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
Condemn no

1337
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:46,271
Mail-in voting comes up which we know that Alex believes as the scourge of of our electoral system

1338
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,831
Seems like too much of a problem with it

1339
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,111
2014

1340
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,415
I was calling about the

1341
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,839
The balance in the mail

1342
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,143
Everywhere

1343
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,263
Well Fiore's already want no kind of taken over with the Priceless game

1344
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,991
Animal Welfare

1345
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:33,375
New weird I don't know if he is disputing with this guy is saying about mail-in voting but he definitely does

1346
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Doesn't have the same sort of

1347
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
Passion behind

1348
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,239
No that's a function of

1349
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
The it's not a

1350
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
Huge talking point

1351
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,847
In 2014 it's not the right wing

1352
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
Last Salvo

1353
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,967
Had to prove that they like it was stolen

1354
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:53,343
It's so funny to me how often he's telling on himself and then he would just that like

1355
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,159
Wealthy they get all the compassionate and helpful people

1356
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,231
And you like you realize what you just said right

1357
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,023
The inverse of that is you

1358
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:07,423
Do you realize that you said they get all the compassionate and helpful people

1359
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
Beyond the GOP you attract the

1360
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,055
Maligning and Evil

1361
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Misanthropic

1362
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,920
So Alex gets another call and it's a guy who sells iodine

1363
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Just like Alex

1364
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,784
And I thought this was a really boring call until it picks up

1365
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
Really really fast

1366
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,584
Obama

1367
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,616
Naturopathic doctor in Virginia

1368
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
Say that your ex to

1369
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,136
DNA Force we've been having amazing

1370
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
Detoxing the body

1371
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
Just

1372
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Amazing

1373
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,264
Actually repair

1374
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
Whoa

1375
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,976
So apparently this nature pathic doctor

1376
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,280
Calling into Alex's show tunes

1377
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,864
Mega dosing on x2

1378
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Has

1379
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,680
Reverse homosexuality

1380
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
I'm having

1381
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,264
I'm having some problems

1382
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,104
Can you prescribe me something well Alex Jones recommends this

1383
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,384
It's not a prescription

1384
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,408
Great great

1385
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Great great great

1386
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,248
This is this is s***

1387
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
Alex's

1388
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,320
Supplements can reverse

1389
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
Homosexuality

1390
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,648
Now here's my question

1391
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
What's the Texas

1392
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
What's my month stand

1393
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,256
I don't know what in the chemical needs

1394
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
To take

1395
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:15,680
It requires 6 to 9 months what part of the iodine or the zinc

1396
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Choir 6

1397
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:20,032
29 months to activate I feel like I was just playing this

1398
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,592
Clip guys at the altitude needs to be

1399
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:26,688
Discus thrower picked apart I think it speaks for itself quite frankly

1400
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
Real

1401
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
Realshit

1402
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,576
So here's another clip

1403
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Where Alex

1404
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,648
Is it again

1405
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
Condemning his future self

1406
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,536
It has to do with a headline that he has kept reading over the course

1407
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
A comment from an

1408
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,144
Annex Nixon Aid

1409
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
Shahu thanks

1410
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,496
The GOP would be unwise to deal with

1411
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,264
The Tea Party

1412
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,288
No it's not Rodger

1413
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
God dammit

1414
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Yeah but

1415
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,968
Alex does end up saying something about the people who work with Nixon

1416
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,320
Please stop

1417
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
County Antoine

1418
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Republican

1419
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:07,552
I talked all these people to work

1420
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,880
Lead my Showdown a bizarre Direction

1421
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
Is a

1422
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:18,816
Nixon will also turn into an indictment of you bitching about what's Obama going to do with his pardon power

1423
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:23,424
Oh true

1424
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,984
Enjoy

1425
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,288
Your you're

1426
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,824
Looking at his past episodes

1427
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,152
Just makes everything so stupid so stupid

1428
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,432
Make the whole world really

1429
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,016
Yeah I mean

1430
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
The most important man in the world

1431
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Is about to show up

1432
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:46,976
I can't believe I forgotten that he was going to be a article

1433
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
This is

1434
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,552
For drudge was a bad guy family or maybe I'm not sure

1435
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,088
Transformed into the

1436
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,880
Traitorous traitor

1437
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,256
Yeah fight Hillary

1438
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
What events I find really fascinating about this

1439
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
This interview

1440
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,608
Between Alex

1441
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,656
Some Tucker is that

1442
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,936
Tucker says some

1443
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,520
In the wrong way

1444
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,592
This first clip is is biting

1445
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
Looking back

1446
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,664
Can't really argue with it

1447
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,952
There is a lot of movement

1448
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,232
American Pie

1449
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,992
Wrong again

1450
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,512
Really hard to argue with that

1451
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,048
People are going to politically moved

1452
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,864
Go to places that they never imagined they would be

1453
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah that's that's that's a very

1454
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,240
Correct assessment of what happened with Alex

1455
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Joshua

1456
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,568
That's also one of my big problems

1457
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,360
With Tucker Carlson is

1458
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,664
He could not be more aware of how he

1459
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
Sure you know

1460
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,808
Check with Alex we can always walk that stupid be evil Continuum in Tucker is

1461
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,576
Clearly

1462
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,392
A brilliant psychopath

1463
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
There's that interviewed with Dave Rubin

1464
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,768
He was talking about how he lies

1465
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,472
Prescient

1466
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,752
Another indication of

1467
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,288
Use awareness of what keys

1468
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
He's doing in the present

1469
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
No idea what is

1470
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Dairy Queen

1471
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,424
Willing to use rates

1472
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
Motivated

1473
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Trade-in motivate

1474
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Beyond

1475
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,608
Oh really Tucker

1476
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,704
I refused his business model

1477
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Ignition of

1478
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,824
Being aware of the consequences of engaging that way

1479
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,616
Is pretty damning

1480
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:21,760
Yeah but also recognizing the that he knows this is an effective way I mean just that

1481
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,600
Send racial politics that's going to be using it cut

1482
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,368
2

1483
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:32,768
Now I'm going to do a three-part series on George Soros will not be answers America at all

1484
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,840
I'm going to use

1485
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:42,240
A video that says selectively edited shot by Harrison Smith to argue that white people can't get

1486
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,776
Monoclonal antibody mean

1487
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
Chest

1488
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
Just so f******

1489
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
It really is

1490
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Amazing

1491
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,760
When you when you stop and do like

1492
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
Tucker Carlson step back

1493
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
And you think

1494
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,624
I am shocked that human beings behave like

1495
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,160
Like I can

1496
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,696
It's almost like

1497
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
What why

1498
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,024
What are we doing

1499
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:10,656
What are we doing that you can be aware that you're destroying the world where it where they're not like

1500
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,496
Real consequences to people's lives

1501
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
I think it would be

1502
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Academically

1503
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,616
Incredibly interesting to see what

1504
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:24,480
What is why do you do this what is it

1505
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,016
Killing everyone

1506
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:32,416
You're murdering millions of people I can't get any point

1507
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,952
I've been set for the rest of his life

1508
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:37,280
So it's

1509
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:41,632
Really bizarre to imagine that the primary motivation would be money

1510
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,168
I believe

1511
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:49,568
Through the course of this and other interviews that he's done

1512
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,592
In the past

1513
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,152
I think it's piece of piece of s***

1514
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,944
He's actually a really bad person

1515
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,760
Cyclades expressing now

1516
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,576
Actually things that he believed

1517
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,648
Dismiss white nationalist nonsense

1518
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
That's what he does on his show

1519
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:08,512
I do believe that there's an opportunistic aspect of it that is like

1520
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
Hey

1521
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:14,656
It's okay to do this show

1522
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,240
But I'd ever became such that it wasn't appropriate

1523
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
He would change to something else

1524
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,360
Do you like you would go

1525
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:27,456
Neocon supporting the Iraq War

1526
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,272
Absolutely we're not socially acceptable

1527
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,576
And I think you would do that but

1528
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,600
At the same time

1529
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,648
I think deep down he's

1530
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,928
Israel racist a******

1531
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,952
Yeah man

1532
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,232
That's another thing like

1533
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
Why is s***

1534
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,840
Like Jon Stewart

1535
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,400
Just came out new like LED you need to engage with people

1536
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:49,984
Thought I have his old like you famously engagement Tucker Carlson

1537
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,056
And everybody was like all you destroyed him you kicked his ass

1538
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:57,408
You're going to view he'll never work out got cancelled

1539
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
And how did that work out

1540
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,480
Well I think that there's another

1541
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,504
Where's

1542
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,320
Examples of

1543
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
Score

1544
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:14,304
Take his advice about that or his comments about that about Rogan aren't necessarily like

1545
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
The dumbest

1546
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,656
Nothing I just think it's a little bit later

1547
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,496
Really help

1548
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:26,592
Hey are you remember the Third

1549
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,688
November 3rd we heard a description of what losers do I do remember

1550
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,760
See if you think this sounds like a loser

1551
01:31:55,264 --> 01:32:01,408
It's almost like I went to the Hallmarks of being a loser is saying that pretending they're all your shifts going sky-high

1552
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,992
Buddy else is falling apart

1553
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,600
So I noticed something and it's really boring

1554
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
This interview

1555
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,720
Seems to be shiting on the media

1556
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,000
About it

1557
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,304
Very large piece of it

1558
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:12,576
Really feels weird Elizabeth as interview with these dudes are just talk about how awful the mainstream media is well they

1559
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,368
Pretend that they don't both have almost

1560
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,928
Comically large conflicts of interest on the subject

1561
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:20,512
Alex is someone who will never be invited back on any show because he

1562
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,608
We can't control himself and start screaming at people whenever he's allowed on any TV show

1563
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,472
He's a hostile abusive a****** who wraps up his intensity in order to turn it interview

1564
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
Every time

1565
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,056
It's a tacky and desk

1566
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,432
Caught onto that Dynamic so Alex has a real chip on his shoulder about the media

1567
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,224
Help no one wants him around

1568
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,296
On the other side Tucker seems to be pretending that he was

1569
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:47,648
Let Go by both CNN and MSNBC prior to his time at Fox

1570
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:54,560
I feel like you brought up this disastrous Crossfire interview with Jon Stewart led to the show being cancelled Tucker

1571
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:58,144
Publicly humiliated and then CNN decided not to renew his contract

1572
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:03,264
His MSNBC show got cancelled for having low ratings I got replaced by Rachel Maddow

1573
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
Hey look

1574
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:08,128
Tucker is a f****** thirsty a****** in terms of public approval and attention

1575
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,432
After MSNBC before Fox

1576
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,528
He went on Dancing With the Stars which isn't something that a person is illegitimate

1577
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,832
Be some concern that the stain for the big

1578
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
Big media companies

1579
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,720
Dancing with the Stars

1580
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,536
Also use me for celebrity kicked off that season

1581
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:32,192
There's an unspoken reason that these two guys shouldn't necessarily be considered the most unbiased sources on the media

1582
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,496
Considering that they're both people

1583
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,776
Financial incentive

1584
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,056
Demonize the media

1585
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,616
How to show only really as a reason Pig

1586
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Exist if the media sucks

1587
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,736
Tucker's Daily Caller also benefits from people becoming disillusioned with

1588
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
Actual journalist

1589
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,624
Overall though I was pretty surprised to find this interview was so much about just bashing the media

1590
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,768
Like it's supposed to be election day coverage but instead of hypothetical coverage but how the media is going to cover thing

1591
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,584
I bet they're going to really that stupid

1592
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
Compelling radio

1593
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,960
I find it to be

1594
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
A dud

1595
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
This is how the Democrats

1596
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
They're going to lie

1597
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,360
A made-up thing that I said and you know what tomorrow I'm a

1598
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:15,712
A little bit of election talk

1599
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
But it also is a little bit

1600
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Composition of the

1601
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
Holyshit

1602
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:03,328
So here we see even more Proto great research replacement to conspiracy talking points

1603
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
Casually thrown out by Alex and Tucker

1604
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,496
It's much much as it's important to recognize how much of a piece of s*** Alex's and that

1605
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:16,896
The people are shelmore Les Tucker is more than onboard with this whole thing that immigrants voting away is precious white free

1606
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:23,296
I have for California being a one-party State it's fair to say that the state generally swings to the left

1607
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,160
Just a few years prior to this the governor of the state was Arnold Schwarzenegger who's a Republican

1608
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:34,816
The state is considered a safe bet for Democrats in the general presidential election but that wasn't the case in fairly recent history

1609
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,376
Republicans carried the state and every Alexa

1610
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,424
Send from 1968 to 1990

1611
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,776
Elected representatives are mostly Democrats are still plenty of Republicans

1612
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:46,080
State Assembly as well as the state senate

1613
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,920
They're even 10 members of the House of Representatives in California are Republican

1614
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,480
Including the minority leader Kevin McCarthy

1615
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Logic

1616
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,784
Just doesn't work

1617
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,832
Work to make this about immigration either because

1618
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:00,928
Big juicy in California where most officials are Democrats

1619
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,976
But there are number of Republicans in there too

1620
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,024
Sintex

1621
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,864
Most elected officials are Republican but there are some Democrats

1622
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
It just like the California

1623
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
It borders Mexico just like

1624
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,008
California with a bunch of immigrants

1625
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Yeah

1626
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,384
Grievance Obsession being treated as if his actual politics

1627
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:27,552
Something to Tucker's been on board with an arguing in favor of since before Trump was around before he

1628
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,648
I still think stalkers a fraud

1629
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
The lot of this races

1630
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
List

1631
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,976
I do think that

1632
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,024
Yeah I would like

1633
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:43,168
Was not able became unacceptable to do his wife Power Hour show that he does now

1634
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:48,032
He would go away for a little while and he'd repackage like a like a wrestler

1635
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Justin

1636
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:52,128
Decided it isn't going to work anymore let's try a new character for you

1637
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,480
But underneath I do think that I racist she would still exist

1638
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,296
I mean it would be it would be even more

1639
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Depression

1640
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
And nice

1641
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,416
For both alexson and Tucker to a just been like

1642
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,440
Inhaler

1643
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:11,584
What I believe doesn't matter I'll say whatever and how crazy is the media they're just going to keep hiring me

1644
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Just a name

1645
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:16,192
Are going to hire for no reason

1646
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:25,152
I don't have any ability and I'm a terrifying psychopath recently Tucker Carlson

1647
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,688
Most known as a pie

1648
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,016
Punchline wore a bow tie and got humiliated by John Stewart

1649
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,320
I don't understand why he has purchased

1650
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,648
In any kind of job market well I mean

1651
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,952
Traditionally white aristocrats

1652
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
Oh good morning pretty well

1653
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,024
Yeah I guess so

1654
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
So Alex play the clip of Obama

1655
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,632
I think pretty witty

1656
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:50,496
I believe this is Obama telling people

1657
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,056
You'll get out there and folk multiple times

1658
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Y'all get out there

1659
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,640
Bota bota

1660
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,096
Voter ID laws

1661
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
Sorry

1662
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:57,312
So Tucker isn't that stupid as to think that the only reason you could oppose voter ID laws is what you want to allow voter fraud to take place

1663
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,080
Not that dumb

1664
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:03,456
Cover for his actual position which is from the right to vote

1665
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:09,344
There been many studies about hair discrimination is baked into many of the various voter ID requirements

1666
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Estates of implemented

1667
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,024
One of the main ways this was achieved was by making seemingly arbitrary decisions about what forms of ID would be

1668
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
Considered valid for voting

1669
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,192
What states like North Carolina allowing various types of ID that were disproportionately held by white voters

1670
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,776
And not allowing ones that were disproportionately held by non-white voters

1671
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,944
Studies Amidon they're also shown that voter ID laws are not apply universally in Highwood discriminatory bias

1672
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
How they're enforced

1673
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,088
There was a Caltech MIT study done about the application of voting laws in New Mexico

1674
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:46,464
Hispanic voters were asked for ID more frequently than white voter

1675
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:51,328
Tucker understands all this s*** but in order to make his position socially acceptable to hold

1676
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,888
He has to pretend that he doesn't understand any of this

1677
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,448
Voter ID requirements are perfectly Fair

1678
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,776
Perfectly effective as a means of stopping in-person voter fraud

1679
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,848
And also at which also basically doesn't ever happen

1680
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
In real world

1681
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
According to the ACLU between

1682
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,968
2020-17 quote

1683
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,552
There were only 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation

1684
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
The only type of fraud that photo IDs could prevent

1685
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,952
During the. Of time in which over 1 billion ballots were cast

1686
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,768
Have you been these credible allegations are often just

1687
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,072
Honest mistakes people made as opposed to attempt

1688
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
That's actually illegal to vote

1689
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,424
Nonexistent problem

1690
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
On the Tucker and Alex are trying to solve

1691
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,288
Because the solution they're advocating actually served their real agenda

1692
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,360
Which is disenfranchising the voting rights of non-white America

1693
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,920
The whole song

1694
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,736
It's it's

1695
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,272
Like

1696
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Truly

1697
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Dumb

1698
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,344
Or running

1699
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,880
Informed on issues

1700
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,416
But I might believe that they

1701
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,440
Heard somebody

1702
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:54,560
We say there's no reason to oppose voter ID laws except for if you want a bet

1703
01:41:54,816 --> 01:42:00,448
Voter fraud so let me explain that to you and we can have a conversation Tucker is not that person.

1704
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
You know

1705
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,800
I know exactly why we're people with

1706
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,592
Disagree with voter ID laws

1707
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:08,128
And what they don't know is

1708
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,152
I'm actually

1709
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,992
We just erase it they have no idea that what I'm saying

1710
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,784
Is it true and I don't believe

1711
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,064
Myacura Secret

1712
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
I am a racist

1713
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Yeah

1714
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,232
It's a little bit transparent

1715
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,280
They make a big mistake

1716
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
Alex and Tucker

1717
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,912
And the first call that they get

1718
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,936
I think it's a really

1719
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,728
Interesting perspective

1720
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,008
Get brought up and Alex

1721
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
Is

1722
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
Not happy about it

1723
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,616
In Pennsylvania

1724
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:49,344
Alex

1725
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
Tucker Carlson

1726
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,672
And I just wanted to say that

1727
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:57,536
Pelicula website is really an aberration and conservative media in terms of

1728
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Disrespect

1729
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,888
Short women that it hasn't website

1730
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,032
Over-sexualized

1731
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,704
Well Alex is really fast and aggressive trying to run cover for Tucker

1732
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,288
Read about the strawman to protect him from this colors criticism

1733
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,176
It's really fascinating as a thing to see the offensive Alex God and how quickly it went down

1734
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:50,784
This color has a question about the Sexes with the Daily Caller in an order to protect

1735
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,368
Feelings and to make sure the audience doesn't take the scholars Point seriously

1736
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:59,488
Alex tries to immediately find a way to distort her Point into being so how about how the

1737
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
The existence of man has sex

1738
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:05,888
This obviously isn't what you saying but the goal Alex is shooting for his

1739
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:10,752
The bait and respond to this dummy argument instead of sticking to our initial point

1740
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,288
Which is threatening to Alex and Tucker

1741
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
Her self-image

1742
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:17,152
You see this kind of thing with Alex all the time because his actual positions are mostly

1743
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:17,920
Indefensible

1744
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,296
If you wanted to argue about like Refugee or immigration issues with him he just yelled back at you something like

1745
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:29,696
So you support illegal immigrants coming here and telling US citizens

1746
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,720
Where he feels more secure

1747
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,536
Secured and where there is no real chance of anything productive

1748
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,304
Devine discuss

1749
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:38,912
The reality is that the Daily Caller is a long and pretty noted sexism problem

1750
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,472
What example of this was in 2013

1751
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,752
This episode

1752
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
When Ashley Judd was

1753
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
Considering running

1754
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,616
For the headline

1755
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:52,224
Ashley Judd potential US Senate candidate sure has done a lot of on-screen nudity

1756
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:58,880
In an attempt to preemptively delegitimize her as a potential candidate they used Mister skim as a resource

1757
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,184
The document the times that she's been nude in movies

1758
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,976
To the pretty shity wait for someone

1759
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,536
Pretending to be a new site

1760
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,584
No I mean there's nothing

1761
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,656
It's about that sure they do it for all the mail a

1762
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Actors who've tried

1763
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,704
How many times has

1764
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
Arnold Schwarzenegger bench

1765
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,800
Shirtless in a movie

1766
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:21,664
Whatever Central roast of presidential candidate

1767
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:28,064
Plenty more examples of ism The Daily Caller but I think the actual larger problem

1768
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
The lead writer for

1769
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,160
Tucker's fox show but to resign effort came out today

1770
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
Posting file racist

1771
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,976
Alexis schitt online for years

1772
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:39,840
Little boy prolific writer at the Daily Caller having almost 2,000 articles

1773
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,120
Zombicide with his byline

1774
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:46,240
One of them that was particularly shity was from October 2016

1775
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,288
It's described in a Media Matters article like this

1776
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,944
Quote best describes a driver running over a group of Native Americans protest in Columbus

1777
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
Conquest of America

1778
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,368
The article ran with a sub headline that read quote white man overruns indigenous peoples with Superior technology

1779
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:07,488
Daily Caller is a pile of s*** publication that produces the exact kind of racist

1780
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,024
Austin Texas contact that Alex wants

1781
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
See the world

1782
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,352
And also has the Veneer Wood

1783
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,192
Bi-Rite we bring some of this stuff up

1784
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:19,776
Then it's his job to run interference and create strawman argument

1785
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,568
Try to get this collar off balance

1786
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,872
You'll notice that sucker didn't say anything

1787
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,664
That was all just Alex feeling the need to

1788
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,432
Defend Tucker

1789
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,480
Leslie both end up looking bad

1790
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,248
Yeah

1791
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,272
Really

1792
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,088
You know how you know how in

1793
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,672
In trials and s*** whenever it turns out like

1794
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
Like 10 years later that the

1795
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
The cop

1796
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,792
Who is the witness at your trial was a f******

1797
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:46,400
Coke dealing corrupt piece of s*** you know and then everybody who

1798
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:48,448
Who was involved with that cop

1799
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:54,080
Has the chance to relive everything reopen

1800
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
If your

1801
01:46:56,384 --> 01:47:00,992
Writer turned out to be a massive racist like you have to go back through every article he's ever written

1802
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,064
Put a new headline up there that says massive racist wrote that

1803
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,416
All I get asked to be like a whole system

1804
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,720
I think you do have to do some pretty hard soul-searching

1805
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,536
If you have somebody who is a flagrant races

1806
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:17,120
Posting horrible s*** online

1807
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,960
Anu it turns out he's been writing for you for years

1808
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,008
He's our lead writer on your TV show

1809
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,080
And he has over 2000 articles on your website

1810
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,360
Should open the box

1811
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,128
Locks up

1812
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,408
And see how

1813
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
How

1814
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
Much.

1815
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:36,320
Acted his coverage how much it impacted your show and he was leader

1816
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,648
You don't do that because that was part of why he works there

1817
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:46,048
No no I mean I'm telling on themselves again it's awful that we had to let him go because we agree with everything that he's written huh

1818
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,400
Yeah it what these meddling Libs

1819
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
Good news is

1820
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,448
We have

1821
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:56,288
No reason to believe the Tucker Carlson has agreed with any of his thoughts

1822
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,824
Except for a lot of

1823
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:03,456
So unfortunately I have bad news actually has a different point

1824
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:09,600
Then the real argument about sexism

1825
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:14,976
Actually she has more of a puritanical

1826
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
This with

1827
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,792
Read article

1828
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Sexy girls

1829
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,336
3 years and has three daughters

1830
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,936
Trying to sell products

1831
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,288
Prosecuted

1832
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,568
Quite

1833
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:07,200
Tell if this was her Point going off track because of Alex's lancerpoint

1834
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,784
Either way I don't think this is

1835
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,392
The really good way for the point to be made about Daily Caller sexism

1836
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,208
Which is unfortunate because it is a legitimate point.

1837
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,488
Could be brought up in is

1838
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,792
At least sort of raised by this caller

1839
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:24,608
Rivers goes off track Amanda Alex and Tucker

1840
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,888
Alright

1841
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,424
Yeah they're they're shown to be

1842
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,496
The innocent I do think this was her original point

1843
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
Because before she was cut off

1844
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,080
She started talking about how

1845
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
That this

1846
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,408
Contribute as much as the

1847
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:43,040
Left the bottom I think she is trying to say that

1848
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,832
I'm tired of

1849
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,880
Both the right and the left

1850
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,160
Six update good with whatever

1851
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,184
I mean I don't know

1852
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
I guess

1853
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,768
Alex has decided that because

1854
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,792
The Scholar was critical

1855
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,328
Probably was a false

1856
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:31,680
Show on the women of the IDF

1857
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,984
Hilarious

1858
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,104
Very light-hearted way

1859
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,920
Serious or creepy bad at all

1860
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:42,944
Maxim

1861
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,224
I mean

1862
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,504
I don't know look

1863
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,576
Look at these sexy apartheid enforcers

1864
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,856
It's very weird

1865
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,392
So Tucker

1866
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:53,952
Has a guy in the Senate that he's a fan of

1867
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,328
Strom Thurmond

1868
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:20,576
Surprisingly

1869
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:25,184
Stan has a record of consistently opposed invivo tonight sac

1870
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,256
And has open hostility towards

1871
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:34,656
He's such an anti-venom right a****** that when he was nominated for a federal judgeship by Reagan in 1986

1872
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,728
He was rejected due to concerns about his comments on race

1873
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:44,640
ACP the southern Christian leadership conference Operation Push in the National Council

1874
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:48,992
Churches were all on American organization teaching anti-American values

1875
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,576
He also said that organizations like the n-double-acp quote

1876
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,136
For civil rights down the throats of people

1877
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,416
Or courses

1878
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:59,744
Mixing irohazaka geisendorfer.

1879
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,072
But the clan okay until I learn to smoke pot

1880
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:06,400
Sure gestations isn't honest and principled

1881
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
Manners

1882
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:11,520
Very honest and principled about his racism in opposition to voting rights for non-white people

1883
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:16,896
It tracks the Tucker would like to see him as the most popular member of Congress

1884
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,664
Subway

1885
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,760
Fun it is going to be an uphill battle for that one I'll tell you I'll tell you that right now

1886
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:22,784
Yeah

1887
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:25,344
So this interview was was bizarre because

1888
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,368
There isn't like a

1889
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,904
A ton of obsequious nationality

1890
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,208
There's no indication that this person

1891
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,488
Possibly be the most

1892
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,536
Person in the world someday

1893
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,096
It's really just shiting on the media

1894
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:40,448
Yeah it does seem to be that they're on relatively equal power footing

1895
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,216
At this point

1896
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:45,824
Time above

1897
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:51,968
Yeah it's a contributor on Fox but I have his

1898
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,552
Interesting dynamic

1899
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,856
Outrageous amount of racism

1900
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,416
Those flying around prior to Tucker coming on

1901
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:03,744
The man even while he's there he's engaging with it

1902
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,536
Yeah with Alex

1903
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:06,816
Hello

1904
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:12,704
I found this to be a little bit of an underwhelming episode from the standpoint of like

1905
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:16,032
Learning about the midterms

1906
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:19,616
I am seeing some kind of alike

1907
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,152
Good dynamic

1908
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,456
Between him and Tucker the might tell us something

1909
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,480
About the future

1910
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,528
I think the only thing that you could take away from this

1911
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,320
As it relates to what you would expect

1912
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,880
These guys do have a bit

1913
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,416
The philosophical alarm

1914
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,952
Visa vie

1915
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,976
Non-white people should

1916
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,328
I guess that is the Bedrock of their relation

1917
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,864
Jeff you can kind of see it that way

1918
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,936
One last clip

1919
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:48,032
Here and Alex's another conspiracy theory about that collar

1920
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,080
I was critical of the Daily Caller

1921
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
What time

1922
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,792
Great great stuff

1923
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,840
You know it it sucks

1924
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
Sucks

1925
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
Really hard because

1926
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,680
It is like

1927
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,984
God damn it if people were

1928
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:20,032
Taking this as seriously as

1929
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
F****** was

1930
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
Cuz this isn't

1931
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:26,688
This wasn't new in 2014 it wasn't new in 2008

1932
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,968
It wasn't new

1933
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:30,016
It what it was new and Reagan

1934
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,856
You like this is s*** that should have been Stamped Out

1935
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,904
And instead every f******

1936
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
10 years we just go

1937
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:40,256
Well they haven't killed anybody for a while so let's just let it

1938
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024
Ride

1939
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:47,168
Yeah I am not talking about the control

1940
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:50,496
The ideological patience

1941
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,520
That

1942
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
People see

1943
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,312
Seem to have

1944
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:56,128
With a lot of these incredibly intolerant ideas

1945
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,968
Necessarily lead to

1946
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,808
The things that we see happening

1947
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,856
It's absurd it is it is strange

1948
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,880
Is there today patience

1949
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,648
Exist

1950
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,928
Yep that's crazy

1951
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,000
I mean I don't I don't

1952
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:15,328
I don't know why that exists in a larger sense I think with Alex

1953
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,352
What I said earlier

1954
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,400
Kind of is relevant that is it

1955
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,448
Most people who aren't

1956
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,472
Like me

1957
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,360
You don't want to listen to a whole episode of

1958
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,152
It speaks to something wrong with me

1959
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
I get that

1960
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:33,248
Most people want to live their lives and just have a normal existence share

1961
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:38,624
Where is I want to play Dynasty alert about that

1962
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,648
So I get it

1963
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,208
I think that wreck

1964
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:45,280
Recognizing exactly what is being conversed

1965
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,048
About

1966
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,072
Behind

1967
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:53,472
The flimsy arguments about like well we really should have voter ID because it'll make things more secure

1968
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
Is

1969
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,336
Behind that is a guy who's

1970
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
Saying that

1971
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:02,688
Too many minorities at Walgreens is Mos Eisley Cantina

1972
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:07,808
And that girlfriend was almost kidnapped

1973
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:12,160
Bad because his Austin downtown is a war zone of a roaming black gangs

1974
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,464
Yeah I mean maybe the simplest

1975
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:18,304
The simplest explanation for why it were so tolerant is because

1976
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,352
Everybody

1977
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,120
Treats

1978
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,400
The

1979
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,424
Right wing

1980
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
As though

1981
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,728
They're speaking

1982
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
Honestly

1983
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,568
I mean

1984
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,592
Really go back

1985
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,896
And look at like a presidential debate

1986
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,688
Without being like Oh you

1987
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,736
You you just lied

1988
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
And nobody said

1989
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:42,880
You're a f****** liar you're a liar who's lying right now you can't say that to take it back

1990
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
Stop lying

1991
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:49,280
I'm not lying prove I'm lying

1992
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:51,072
Public trust is eroded

1993
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,608
It's so much that there's not even the extra

1994
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Vacation

1995
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:59,776
The death of an unspoken

1996
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
Brutal

1997
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,104
Yeah I don't know

1998
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,128
I think it sucks

1999
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:08,480

We reaffirm

2002
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:20,768
This s*** runs deep we got to put Alex on the timeout he's a monster in a certain way would go see him be a monster in a different way

2003
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:26,144
I forgot to put Alex in the past on timeout

01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,056
