1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Worship at the altar

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,656
Text Joe.

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,520
Which baseball today my bright spot today Jordan some me call this trivial

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Some may call this unimportant

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
About ND I was a grocery shopping

10
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
And I notice

11
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,040
Something that I didn't really realize existed but I kind of probably did at the back of my mind

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
I got a leprechaun

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
About lucky charm

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
VIP

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Sauce cups

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Softcup

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,304
Disposable sauce cups do I understand

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
Yeah in the like paper plates section

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Realize date they would just sell

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Like a big pack of those from a restaurant

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
You have access to soft I figured there be an embargo on just civilians buying sauce cups

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
Why would I go to a restaurant

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
I love it I love to dip

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Dipping is a hobby of mine answer this is really exciting

25
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
It's made me think like okay

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
I got this bag of that

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,400
And that's great I may need to see if I can find reusable

28
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Of the

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
Exact same size like why not

30
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Let's go eat somewhere

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
MedExpress cost

32
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,224
No probably there are some that are

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh no

34
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
My bright spot Danny's I had a great Friday

35
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,352
First thing first I finished my hand tattoo little bit darker

36
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,752
It's great got a nice little contrast in there added some Shadows there and then later on I finally got to

37
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Speak in not person but in audio with that socialist

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
And it went great

39
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
And what

40
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
And the stream exploded power in my entire block shut off right

41
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Suspicious

42
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Haha

43
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,008
Sabotaging your stream

44
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Yeah

45
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,664
Without a hitch yeah you were texting me about your power being out and I was

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Like looking into it and seeing if I can find an update for sure that there would be something

47
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
It was it was weird to me how long it took for anything to show up on comed outage map

48
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
But yeah

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,888
Eventually it did and then how long did it last when did your power come back on

50
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,752
Do pick back up on the Stream

51
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Unfortunate

52
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Well I am glad

53
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
While it did

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
It was

55
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,040
I am probably next time there won't be a Transformer explosion

56
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
Unless it is suspicious

57
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,167
Triple-S cereal stream temperature today

58
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,239
Last week we decided

59
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
It was not

60
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,871
Anyone's best interest for us to cover Alex's response to the Uvalde

61
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Right

62
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
The time has come

63
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
And today we are going

64
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Going to be getting into that

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,879
Here's here's the sort of syllabus of of things today is almost the bottle

66
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Episode you could say

67
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Inasmuch as we're just going to be talking

68
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
About Alex's emergency report from that night

69
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Broadway 24th

70
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
2022

71
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Hours after the shoot

72
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Oh my God

73
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,567
Yes and be covering that and then on Wednesday will get into more of thee like

74
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Continue to operate such a document of Alex's respond

75
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Tas mother stop

76
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
It felt like it it had a stand-alone quality

77
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
And see what's going on and then as we cover more of the time afterwards can see how things

78
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
Maybe develop the reasons that I'm giving this

79
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,351
Caveat is because

80
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
As we're recording in present day

81
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,287
We are aware of a number of things that it's unfair to Judge Alex by

82
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
On this day

83
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,943
Like in terms of the police response write a lot of that conversation

84
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,087
That is awareness that we have that we shouldn't transposon to what we're covering today

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Correct and it's difficult

86
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
2

87
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Sort of

88
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,047
Segment that discussion for once

89
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Supposed

90
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
And obviously I'm not trying to avoid it or anything of that information was not known

91
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,663
And you can really only judge somebody by the information that's known and what they do with it

92
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
When they do what they do is close reading within the context

93
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Steady it is given

94
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
I got hoes to Bringing whatever it is we decide to bring to maybe this is being a little bit

95
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Too precise with things

96
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Things but I think in the

97
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
The context of

98
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
This coverage

99
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
What is this

100
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Monumental

101
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Traumatic

102
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Baby bears that

103
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Yes so we'll get to this episode but first tell the second to say hello to some new walk

104
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199

I have

117
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Risen above

118
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Miami

119
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
So take a little break now

120
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
A little break e for me

121
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
And then we're going to

122
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Comeback

123
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
And I mean

124
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Start the show over

125
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
F*** you

126
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

127
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
F*** you and your new world order

128
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
And f****** horse you rode in on

129
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
And all your s***

130
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Maybe today

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

132
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Real walk out of here tomorrow

133
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
And you never see me again

134
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
That's really what I want to do

135
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
I never want to come back here again

136
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
I apologize to

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Yesterday that I

138
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

139
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
I'll be better tomorrow

140
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
A million times he is not better tomorrow

141
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,719
Nununu absolutely not

142
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
7

143
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
In the evening

144
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Central Time

145
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
And in Austin

146
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
And

147
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Give a little bit of a caveat warning

148
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Maybe

149
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
I think Alex is a little drunk

150
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
I don't know if he's

151
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Drunk but his

152
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
He is not

153
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
He's not communicating the normal way that he does

154
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
I want to give a little bit of a possible

155
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Explanation in that Lake

156
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Maybe he's just really tired

157
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
I don't know but there are there are mannerisms that are like

158
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
This guy seems a little bit

159
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
Whatever we're dealing with it is an Ultra

160
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
State

161
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Whatever the case

162
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,263
For it may be part of the reason he has Owen Shroyer co-host

163
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Sing with him

164
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,175
Because I don't think Alex could have handled doing this on his so they went back into the studio to record this year

165
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
I have a strong feeling that Alex would for whatever reason there was a there was a lack of energy

166
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Yeah that was that was there and so

167
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
Of course you need

168
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Handles a lot of this

169
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
He's doing

170
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,631
So we start off here at the beginning and Alex

171
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
I mean I feel like this is a little bit

172
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Weird

173
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Seems a little bit

174
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Height almost

175
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
Special Report

176
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Gentlemanly

177
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
I'm on Tuesday night May 24th in South Texas live coverage Ted Nugent

178
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Infowars

179
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
The most banned Network

180
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
In the world

181
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
There is like a this is coming up

182
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Now there's a there's

183
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
It feels unnecessary struck me as a little bit like

184
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,775
Yeah I don't necessarily appreciate a Showmanship

185
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
As a

186
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,223
Way to get people to drawing your broadcast Caesar sting of like we got Ted Nugent

187
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
It is

188
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,855
It is especially a a voice that says get excited

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,487
For what I have to say about this thing about 50%

190
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Yep

191
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Yeah a phone is off

192
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Jimmy Carson was

193
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,239
Announcing like we've got Ted Nugent coming on after this year that you're not far off

194
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,127
Yeah I felt I felt like we were maybe not I hope this would be

195
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Not a good

196
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,271
Start Special Report video package thing that plays after Alex's

197
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Promotional

00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Writing

199
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
And here's where we start the report proper

200
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
708

201
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487

202
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
I'm your host

205
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Shotgun

206
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Ted Nugent

207
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
NRA board member joining us coming up

208
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
In the next hour

209
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Emergency broadcast

210
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
It's like that

211
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Has had a mask

212
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Shooting elementary

213
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Uvalde

214
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Outside of

215
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Antonio

216
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
And they are now reporting

217
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
18 dead

218
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Three adults killed

219
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Uvalde

220
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Too early to say anything but it's very bizarre

221
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Spell laugh

222
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Westmont

223
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Killed his grandmother

224
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
The border patrol is after

225
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Cool crashes

226
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Goguardian

227
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Hilda

228
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Fable

229
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
And then they were saying he was

230
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
He is dead

231
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Is Alex doesn't like doing these Special Report I have some really good news for him

232
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
He absolutely doesn't have to

233
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
The only reason that he's doing this is to strike while the Iron's hot

234
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Impetus

235
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
The drove his actions immediately after the Buffalo shooting

236
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
He was going to take the day off and have a guest host but he couldn't resist the attention of how large the audience was

237
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
In the wake of the shooting

238
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
He literally said that on his own show on air

239
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Royce White is a former NBA player

240
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Martial arts

241
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
As well mixed martial arts

242
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Ilhan Omar

243
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Over here

244
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Ladies and gentlemen

245
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
He's got a special guest

246
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
He was set to host today but things are so hot

247
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
What's going on

248
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Very very specifically

249
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,967
Alex knows full well by this point the tragedies are opportunities for him and he exploited them to the full

250
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
Who's driving this emergency coverage obligation to cover the story in a way that serves the audience and

251
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Inform people

252
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,511
And what are the big tells about this is that he says that the shooter in this case was supposedly Tran

253
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
It's just like a person who attacked Dave Chappelle

254
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Both of these pieces of information are not

255
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
True but Alex knows the transphobia is very popular in his

256
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,591
Larger right-wing Community right now so he can contextualize the shooting that way

257
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,175
And he'll be able to fold it into his other narratives very easily

258
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,575
The person who attacked Dave Chappelle is named Isaiah Lee India's assist man who has given explanation

259
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
A action

260
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,743
It might be because he identifies as bisexual or that he was on Houston Chappelle was making jokes about the

261
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
These things

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
He also told NBC news that quote

263
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,703
Another comedian in the show made a joke about pedophilia and that haven't been molested is trigger

264
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
This situation is a bit difficult to parse out.

265
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,615
Specifically and after the incident the person he lived with in a transitional housing

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
Accused leave stabbing him during a fight back

267
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
December

268
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
He's now being charged with

269
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
Attempted murder in that case

270
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,599
There's a lot going on there but one thing is clear that is deadly is not true

271
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
That's just a narrative it was concocted by the right-wing media.

272
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Demonized

273
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
It was very easy for them to do that too because

274
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Chappelle himself kind of

275
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
After he was attacked Chappelle joke to the person who did it was a transman

276
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,311
Playing on the very well understood reality that a bunch of his recent work has hurt a lot of people in the trans community

277
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
And two players on that idea that they would attack

278
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Back in retaliation

279
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,783
Or something in there that's a facilitated the ease of that to that narrative sticking and you can see it being

280
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Parotid by Alec

281
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Let's do not

282
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
The shooting in Uvalde started at approximately 11:30 a.m. and only a few hours later people on 4chan begins

283
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
Circulating images of a trans woman that they were claiming was the shooter

284
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,143
Intentional effort to perpetuate in a trans hoax

285
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
People on 410 do this thing

286
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
Kind of thing all the time for a lot as well as discuss

287
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Daniel's deposition

288
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
About how he was fooled by 4chan

289
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Slight him to miss identifying Marcel font has the Parkland

290
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Alex is doing the exact same thing here

291
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,599
Fully Illustrated that he's learned exactly zero lessons from the lawsuits

292
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
He's been facing

293
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,999
Alex's timestamp this very conveniently for us and he says that it's 7:08 Central Time

294
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,607
And from there we can see what information was widely available for him to operate off of

295
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
There were multiple trans women who were targeted by the

296
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
The smear campaign

297
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
The first of them goes by Sabrina and it's

298
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,663
6:16 p.m. she posted on Twitter that she was not the shooter even going so far as to post new pictures

299
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
In the same location as the photo being used by trolls

300
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
2704

301
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
It makes sense that Alex wouldn't have time CDs new pics

302
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Set Sabrina post-dated but there's no reason for him not to be aware that this was a hoax

303
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
By the time that he got on a

304
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
There was a second trans woman named Sam who is targeted by these hoaxes

305
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,447
Most likely ways that Alex would have possibly found out about this

306
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,287
Was that at some time prior to 6:39 p.m.

307
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
A poor by the head of Gabourey posted an accusation that Sam was

308
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
The shooter

309
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
This supposed to be made by an account called the nose

310
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Switches apparently verified account on Gab

311
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
I took a little stroll through that account

312
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
And here's the first pin post they have

313
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,511
Quote a homogeneous society is similar to a healthy functioning immune system able to

314
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Detective Brett

315
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Anti-semite race

316
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Also their bio starts quote

317
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
Noticing a noses

318
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
So it's really cool that they not only following this guy but also amplifying their posts are they basically accused

319
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Someone of killing Elementary School student

320
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
In order to promote hate towards

321
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
Trans people

322
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Think he was talk

323
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Talking about specifically Roman

324
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Patrician no

325
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
By 6:30 p.m. people on Twitter were pushing back against this and amplifying post Sam had maged that show The Chew

326
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
She's not the shooter and in fact was still alive

327
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,911
The bottom line is that there is no acceptable reason for Alex Beyond are reporting the story this way

328
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,799
This is one of the first details he's providing about the story so it seems like it's something very important

329
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
He's done literally nothing to check in on it

330
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,479
At best he saw something on 14 and decided to run with it despite it being sued for doing it

331
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Exactly that about another shooting

332
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,135
Answers corporate representative testifying under oath that porch and is not a source he would use

333
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
At worst

334
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
He's reporting this based on Andrew tourbuzz reposting know they clear anti-semite transphobe and white nationalist account on

335
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Who's just repeating random s***

336
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
Visa on 4chan already

337
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Again there's no clear evidence

338
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
It's that Alex is not learn

339
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Any lesson

340
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Consumers lawsuit

341
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Hemet is hatred of trans folks

342
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
Far superseded does obligation to report accurate information

343
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
You can see that just from the jump

344
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Sitz bath

345
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
It's like I understand

346
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Worse

347
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
Then if he was targeting individual

348
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Like the idea that you can't

349
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
I mean

350
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
I guess you can't sue him because he

351
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
He saying that it's it's just a trans

352
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Person

353
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
But ultimately that's more.

354
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Destructive

355
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
That's

356
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
Looking everybody who's trans and saying that they're a f******

357
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,431
Murderer coming from Alex's mouth he's not saying that specifically at this point in time but from his

358
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,807
His mouth that's what it means or epic there's a couple things to disentangle a and one

359
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Cuz I kind of I kind of agree with you because there is

360
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,951
A broad Target that's being put on trans people buy this

361
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
This kind of cover

362
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
And the sort of

363
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
Vagueness

364
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,655
What secondarily Alex does use some very

365
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
Clear distinguishing

366
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
,

367
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,567
That make it clear that he is talking specifically about Sam

368
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Oh okay well then

369
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,199
That is a pets that a person whose picture is he stalking

370
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Yeah so it's it's

371
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
It's

372
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
You have both

373
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Going off

374
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
And

375
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
I do I don't know

376
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
I don't know why he would do something like that

377
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
Can't imagine being

378
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
So committed to being

379
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Bad at your job

380
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,983
That you do this I mean I I I just don't

381
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
You know

382
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
Like I know I know that

383
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,407
The judge is going to see that very informational as soon as poss

384
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
I have your friend

385
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,063
I mean if you see that now in the middle of what he's doing now

386
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
Don't you just say f*** off

387
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
VA does seem to illustrate

388
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Like malice

389
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,791
Continuing

390
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,167
The refusal to understand why the things he did initially were wrong

391
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
Absolutely I don't I don't know what kind of impact that has on

392
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,591
On legal cases I guess what that will remain to be seen but

393
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Yeah if I were him I just probably wouldn't do that stuff

394
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
You would think

395
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,319
He didn't then his audience would revolt on him he has to he cannot

396
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Not give a statement about this

397
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,671
All this

398
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Now he doesn't

399
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,023
How he does not I think it's a testament to how much

400
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
He

401
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
How highly he values his knee-jerk

402
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,959
Patriots and being able to express them

403
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
That that is something that has

404
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
A far higher value to him

405
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Then

406
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Big response

407
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Yeah I mean it's hard

408
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
It's hard to

409
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
You know

410
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
I tried to keep

411
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
Center in your mind at all times but the

412
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
End goal for all of these people

413
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Is a society where they can just say

414
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Always a trans person

415
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
It's Prince people's fault

416
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Whenever they f****** want

417
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
That's what they want

418
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,935
I think a lot of a lot of cases yeah that's true I think

419
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
When you're looking specifically at Alex's coverage I think it's easier to say like

420
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
That is exactly what you would want to do

421
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:09,247
Maybe for other reasons too hot at least because that's a convenient way for him to not talk

422
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,879
Absolutely and I think you're going to see even beyond the transphobia

423
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,744
It's going to be grasping at straws trying to find any way to make this about something else

424
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
You got does immediately after this

425
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
Just trying to find other

426
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Rationalization

427
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Here's the

428
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
No one is listening the death

429
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Children

430
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
It's terrible and I have four children when I'm driving

431
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
It tears at my God

432
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Kristoff

433
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
We have 40 plus million people

434
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Dynamite

435
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Do Your Love Lockdown from starvation

436
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
We are launching

437
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Massive Wars

438
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,256
We have all of the depopulation agenda going on and I predict

439
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Accurate up from

440
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Last week with Plato about 30 minutes

441
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Jones

442
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Predicted

443
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Mass shooting

444
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Black Roshe

445
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
And I shed going into the midterms

446
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
168 days out

447
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,968
All the pre-programming is the terror attacks the mass shootings are going to happen

448
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
They weren't happening

449
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,600
It's so transparent how Alex only brings up these talking points bite statistics about food in

450
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,440
Security in the developing World whenever he needs to use them to minimize an atrocity

451
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Spinner sex with something he cares about

452
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
If you needs to complain about people wearing masks

453
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,936
When he brings up the issue of people starving and presented as something that's been solely caused by covid prevention measures

454
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
If you needs to minimize the murder of 19 children and Elementary School into teachers he brings up

455
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
A starving people to make that number of children look small

456
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
He's a spineless coward and I would take this a little more seriously if he seemed to care about those issues

457
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,392
Relating to food access in the developing world when it wasn't something he was using as a shield

458
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Do not address the issue that he's supposed to

459
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Recovering

460
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Hold on.

461
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Taking credit for calling this one even though he made a huge deal out of how the Buffalo shooting was what he predicted because he said black grocery

462
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
I guess if you get to claim that you're some kind of a genius for predicting that a school shooting would happen eventually than everyone in the world is a genius

463
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Cuz we all knew it was coming

464
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,712
Dipson the number of school shootings in mass shootings in general for a while because of covid lockdown

465
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,576
There were less massive Gatherings of people in schools were closed in many plays

466
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
That's

467
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Plenty of school shooting center

468
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
2020

469
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,768
Alliston Wikipedia include 72 shootings at schools

470
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Since the beginning

471
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
2020

472
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
Alex's premise is that they've been hyping up this idea of school shootings in order to

473
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
To get someone to do one because it's

474
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
The copycat crime kind of thing

475
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Globalist

476
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Still trying to incite

477
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,200
Stupid because they're been all of these school shootings that have happened that were typed up and Alex has no idea

478
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Even happen

479
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Bunch of them happened in

480
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Does home state as well he still doesn't know

481
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,904
For instance does Alex remember that on October 6th 2021 Amman open

482
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,488
Open fire at Timberview High School in Arlington Texas injuring four people

483
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
I've never heard him bring that up

484
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
Remember that less than a week for that a 25-year old dude broke into

485
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
Do YES Prep Southwest School in Houston in

486
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
And shot the principal

487
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
These things because you never heard about them and it didn't cover

488
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
If the media truly were hyping up school shooting

489
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Alex's

490
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
There would have been wall-to-wall coverage of the tons of school shootings that have happened

491
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
And most people in the country never heard happened

492
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,392
Because this stuff is just going to become a twisted reality

493
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Of our born lives

494
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
As was true in the case of Sandy Hook the horrific nature of what happened in Uvalde is a severe threat to Alex's political

495
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Audiology

496
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,472
And you can see that manifested and how he's responding to this with a scattershot strategy

497
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
They're already a ton of excuses he's trying to he's trying about

498
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
See what's going to fly

499
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:51,456
He's asserted that the shooters trance so if that works out for him he can make us about his transphobic narratives

500
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Instead of about God's

501
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,296
He's blamed the media for supposedly hyping up shooting

502
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
So he can claim that this was a case of globalist Mind Control

503
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Was supposed to be in the back.

504
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
And if all else fails he's minimize the death toll compared to the number of people going without food in the developing world so if he has to he can

505
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Retreat to that talking point

506
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
He has a moral High Ground

507
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
Oh you're upset about nineteen dead kid what about all the people in the developing world without a food not so righteous now

508
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
How are you

509
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,688
It's really transparent how much of a threat this is to Alex and he's behaving according

510
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,576
He knows damn well that isn't the sort of event that has precipitated tighter gun regulation in other countries in the past

511
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,208
Sophia through full-court press immediately Detroit create new narratives about the shooting while the cement is still wet

512
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Muca

513
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Yep

514
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Asus graphics

515
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Imagery

516
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
But

517
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,704
I really do think that it's a one-to-one comparison and it said good

518
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
Thought to have in your mind whenever he says shitla

519
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Because it is

520
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Bucked up

521
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
But whenever he's like

522
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Listen I predict

523
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Did this I'm so smart

524
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
Predicting all of this s*** he is masturbating with a

525
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
The dead child

526
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
That is what the f***

527
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Happening

528
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Which crackers

529
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
You know what that's what it is

530
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
Is Eddie gets to just say it because it's just f****** words

531
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:12,352
You know you don't see if anything's it is words

532
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
Absolutely

533
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
Disgusting version of DeSoto

534
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Absolutely sick I told you so

535
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
199 saying and it's Cebu

536
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Boo Boo Boo

537
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
No and it's

538
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,224
It's not just told you so I would love for it to just be and I told

539
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
You so

540
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
It is a

541
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Look at how

542
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Great I Am

543
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Right

544
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
Do we did this with the Buffalo shooting we demonstrated how he didn't really predict this at that

545
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,400
Grocery store prediction about

546
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,448
Shootings that we're going to happen

547
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
Year ago when the audit of the 2020 election

548
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
Was going to drop

549
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,384
To rely on

550
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
He have that the optic

551
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Pics of that but he was working with

552
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,552
And now he's trying to apply to this even though the circumstances are totally different

553
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
Hey it's all just

554
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Just f*****

555
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
Stop.

556
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
Nope

557
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,280
So Alex has another theory about what might have

558
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
You've caused this

559
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
This is

560
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Just

561
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Awful

562
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
There are a lot of mentally ill people in AC mass shootings being high

563
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,032
Sandy Hook Sandy Hook Sandy.

564
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Music My Name by the way

565
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Attaching yourself to me

566
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
In the news every day and

567
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Well that's something I could

568
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,576
To do too early to tell there's a lot of blurred stuff going on as this develops

569
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,672
That's disgusting and almost inhuman level of narcissism but Alex is displaying

570
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
He's actually claiming the coverage of the lawsuit against him over his claims about Sandy Hook may have been part of the reason the shooting happen

571
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
I understand correctly people shouldn't

572
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
Alex because that'll end up causing coverage of the reason he's being sued and then mentally ill people will hear this about this mass shooting

573
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
I should do that

574
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Is that the argument that he's making

575
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,248
That's ridiculous I believe his argument is stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself

576
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,576
Well really this mass shooting happened because you're persecuting me

577
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
I am going to Abby

578
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Views you as much as humanly

579
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
Possible and then blame you for the out

580
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
I really just don't understand

581
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
How

582
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
You can see things and insist there about you

583
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
And such a discus

584
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Spring fashion it's it's

585
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
II

586
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
It's amazing

587
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Not in a good way

588
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,296
No it amazes know it really at you know it is something that when we talked to

589
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,624
Jon Ronson you know he brought up that idea of like

590
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
What are we judging Alex

591
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Based upon

592
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
Do you know like we're judging him based

593
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Step on human society and he doesn't belong

594
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
You know.

595
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
So so he just lives by a completely set a different set of

596
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
Existed

597
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
I still go back to that moment we were talking to him

598
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
When you he asked

599
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
If Alex work

600
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Himself

601
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
And I said yes

602
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Disappointed to hear that I think about that a bit

603
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
No Jon Ronson somebody who knows Alex course

604
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,072
Presumably has some familiarity with him and I did for him it was a kind of

605
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
A deflating idea that Alex doesn't just

606
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,240
Nope no not off the Dome it's not brand new every time

607
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
The same bulshit over and over and over again

608
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
CNA

609
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
Comedian multiple times to realize do they do the same

610
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
Kind of thing ever

611
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Anyway

612
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
Alex's mother about why

613
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
The shootings happened to her

614
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
Sure 12

615
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Not enough know you're like

616
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
45th

617
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Ali got

618
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,864
In place within the borders collapsing thousands dying

619
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
Every few months down there no news coverage to speak of

620
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
And now we have

621
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Have this all I know is

622
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Where the season

623
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
The midterms

624
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
Right on time to Psychopaths

625
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Strike

626
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
What do you think's going on on Troy

627
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
So there's a lot going through my head right now

628
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
And

629
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Let's bring up the midterms

630
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
That are coming up with

631
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Just mentioned I have no doubt

632
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
That this is going to be used

633
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Promote

634
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Beto O'Rourke

635
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Running for governor

636
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Stabbed it I've no doubt Beto O'Rourke

637
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Pretty much running a losing

638
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Campaign right now

639
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
He can barely fill a

640
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
School

641
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Auditor

642
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Really not even on

643
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
Auditorium

644
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Google classroom

645
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
And so they need something to promote Beto and Texas

646
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,712
Cancel this is about the midterm somehow

647
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
I feel like it's B

648
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,112
Still pretty early of this emergency Special Report

649
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Words speculating

650
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
This has some connection to

651
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Midterm election

652
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
I mean

653
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,864
Wow, talking about when we would like

654
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,192
Is our last episode Project Camelot one we're talking about the

655
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
The merging of conspiracy and politics

656
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Like it's just

657
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
What the f***

658
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Yeah

659
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
What the f*** are you honestly doing

660
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
Yeah like deep down

661
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
What the f*** are you doing

662
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,576
So Alex has been building up kind of this idea that there weren't

663
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
These shooting

664
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
The shootings happening

665
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
And now the midterms happening

666
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
And all of a sudden

667
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,632
So he saying that we didn't live in America for the past 2 years

668
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
There's so many different angle

669
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
Kohl's Alex would I look at that okay so

670
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,616
We had over 200 mass shootings in this country in the year 2022 alone 200 mass shootings

671
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
But only two of them and made the media

672
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
The national press and that's

673
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
The one in Buffalo most recently and then

674
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Of course this one today in Texas

675
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
Asian on Asian or black on Asian no cover

676
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,976
So hero and accidentally deflates Alex's entire narrative about hyping up mass shooting

677
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,072
If they're bent over 200 of them and there's only been major media coverage of

678
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
2

679
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
Tends to make the argument that the media is actually downplaying mass shooting

680
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
Alex kind of realizes that that's a point that you withdraw from this conversation so he throws out of distraction point but he feels that shooting

681
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,384
Things done by now people don't get coverage

682
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
Again this is literally the fraudulent talking point that Dylan roof cited as being his radicalization point

683
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
Towards carrying out the Charleston shootings Alex

684
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
Probably stop repeating it all the time

685
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Hawaiian

686
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
Has no idea what he's talking about here

687
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
There has been media coverage of other shooting

688
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Things this year

689
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
I want to go also playing games here because he knows exactly why there's been more media attention as it relates to be Buffalo and you've

690
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Baldy shooting

691
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,592
First lady of all the mass shootings that have occurred this year these are the two with the highest death toll

692
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
By a considerable amount

693
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,760
Second there the shootings that have particularly horrifica Eric eristics that make them more painful.

694
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
The general population

695
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,160
Any instance of Buffalo there was a shooter who is a white nationalist who set out to Carrie

696
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,976
The shooting is specifically to kill black people

697
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:08,096
In the case of Uvalde though there weren't too many details available when I went on air

698
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,704
Do the f****** elementary school and they knew that at least 18 children have been murdered

699
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,848
Ono's these Dynamics perfectly well but he's pretending not to in order to make it suspicious that these two shootings

700
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
God more attention

701
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
And imply that it is something to do with the midterm

702
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,040
This is unacceptable Behavior ashamed of himself for this kind of coverage

703
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
The reason I act like this is because

704
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
This story and stories like this threatened their basic far-right ideology and almost every level it so they have to attack.

705
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
That reality when these stories exist

706
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
At all

707
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Diane Betts

708
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,216
Why they're sort of warping reality around the the way they are it's

709
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Yeah

710
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
I mean

711
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
You know it is it is also one of those things

712
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Square

713
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
It doesn't matter what

714
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
That is going

715
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Going to stay this

716
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
I kind of don't even understand why they bother with

717
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Finding

718
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Alternate explanation

719
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Supposed to

720
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Just saying

721
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
You know what yeah it's guns

722
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,232
Fault but we love gun so much that we're going to let your kids die whenever they had whenever they die

723
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Yeah I wonder if that would play

724
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
What I mean I don't know why not everybody knows it

725
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
I think I think that maybe

726
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
You don't

727
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
I almost you have a great handle on

728
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Maybe the psychology

729
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
Some of the people who

730
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
Are more drawn towards Alex's

731
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
Swirled obviously denial is a state of existence that you have to enjoy if you don't live in reality

732
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
With the rest of us

733
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
Delivered reality certain amount of denial is necessary to make it through

734
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
What you're saying is a blunt

735
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
Things

736
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
I don't know if I could argue that it would

737
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,080
Dramatically changed but I don't think that's

738
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
A mentality that

739
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,456
Even a lot of these supporters about the show would sign on to

740
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
Yeah maybe not maybe not I think that is gradually

741
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,880
You know I think it's just something that we don't want to find out yet

742
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
You know I think they would rather not find out if that's

743
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
It's going to fly just yet

744
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:17,120
You're deep in the hypothetical speculation territory for me real hearts

745
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Territory

746
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,984
Oh and really thinks that this is the midterm issue

747
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,080
This is where it's kind of like all right

748
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
This is a

749
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Non

750
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
Cancerous point that you're making

751
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,040
The timings weird right I don't know if you need to be making this point

752
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Tonight

753
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
Sprite but like

754
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
40in to be like

755
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
Alright the shooting happened

756
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Politically

757
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
This is going to be something that

758
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Democratic candidates

759
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Can use

760
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,840
I think that's a descriptive

761
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Kind of reality

762
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
I don't think

763
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Vet

764
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Necessarily

765
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
That's

766
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Like

767
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
I don't I don't think it has a lot of meaning

768
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
I don't think that night

769
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,432
8 is the time necessarily where it has the most value to discuss

770
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
It's not the same as a lot of the other

771
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
Conspiracy theories

772
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
What's going on

773
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
That's kind of where Owens heads

774
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,464
And I feel that really it it goes beyond the racial lines

775
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,608
With this I think that they're really drumming up the mass shootings as a new story here before the midterm

776
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Because

777
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,472
The Democrats have nothing we have to remember it's a midterm election year

778
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:31,616
Democrats politicize everything to try to get people to vote so I mean look at all the things they've tried they tried racism

779
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
They tried

780
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
The abortion issue they pried you

781
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Crane

782
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
It's all failed it's all flop

783
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,648
So now they're going to try the gun thing I think that this is their next big push to let's find an issue

784
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
That we can

785
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,232
Use people to go out and vote on and I think

786
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,792
Now it's going to be the gun issue at least they're going to try it

787
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,888
What about the leading cause of death amongst middle-aged men being Fentanyl

788
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,216
Which is all thanks to the open border so 25 us

789
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Veterans wedding so Saturday

790
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Almost

791
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
0

792
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,104
Cupboards or totally sad for what happened

793
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
It's a terrible thing but they know Stu

794
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Statistically they hype up Madison

795
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
And I put mass shootings Elementary

796
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Areas

797
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Crazy people going to go do it

798
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
You can kind of see the difference

799
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
The Desoto Bass perspective that they're giving

800
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,768
Yeah it's talking about the coverage that will happen after the fact

801
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
Alex's saying that coverage of things

802
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Cause that

803
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
Easy there is a difference

804
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
I don't know how meaningful it is but whatever

805
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,872
And you can see you though that I think almost maybe more importantly these guys can address this new story without creating the

806
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Completely separate issue to use as a prop

807
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
100%

808
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:44,576
Talk about the shooting at the cover the story by speculating that the Democrats are going to use guns as a campaign issue in the mid to

809
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
This isn't an emerging

810
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,512
A report about the shooting it's an emergency report attempting to get out in front of whatever coverage other outlets end up doing about the

811
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
The shooting it's damaged

812
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Control more than anything

813
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
And that's something you see again from Alex

814
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
Where's you know when you're coming up with other things

815
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,032
Shooting in an attempt to minimize the horror of what happened

816
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Hours earlier

817
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,176
I weirdly don't hear them bring up covid death toll is here but I guess that's just not the brand

818
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,040
Also there's plenty of media coverage of suicides among enlisted persons and Fentanyl deaths

819
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
Maybe there could be more investigation of the first one but it

820
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
It's not something people are just ignoring

821
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,768
If you really want to do this s*** I can show you how pathetic this game is really easily

822
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
If your interest is just in minimizing the number of deaths occurred you could say that there were 21 people killed here and yes

823
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
That's really sad but

824
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:38,336
Between 2010 and 2020 an average of 39 people die each year in the United States wealth

825
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Skiing you never hear the media tacos

826
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
About that

827
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
It's a fact

828
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,088
But also not relevant to the matter is only bring up if you're actively trying to get your audience

829
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
SS horrified by the horrific shooting that had just half

830
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,744
Yeah it's like it's

831
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,792
You know you would only bring up

832
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:03,168
In a conversation about the Holocaust how many people Stalin killed if you really wanted to let

833
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
People know you are on here

834
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Yep

835
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
So

836
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Alex

837
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
He's clearly very interested

838
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
In the pictures The hoax

839
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Pictures of the shooter

840
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
Course he will end up bringing this up

841
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Constantly

842
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
The reported

843
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Shooter

844
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Has now been killed birthday said he would capture

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Auto driving on a

846
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
You got somebody images of him

847
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
And dresses

848
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
And all the rest of this stuff

849
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
But you're not going to see any of that

850
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,104
Yeah I know I'm sure we'll find out more about this individual and it obviously the individual is extremely deranged

851
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Just how deranged will have to

852
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Define doubt

853
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
I think that Alex think

854
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,272
You playing it safe by settings the reportage

855
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
I don't think that helps

856
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
You reported him as the shooter not the reported shooter

857
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
You are reporting that he is this

858
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:05,120
Then you found these pictures prior to coming and you sent them to your staff

859
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
So when I actually think probably has

860
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,312
Some instincts to not dwell on the pictures that match

861
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Maybe

862
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,176
He's aware of the Kid Daniel's lawsuit could be maybe

863
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,456
Good babe

864
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,504
To talk mostly about psych meds

865
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
But Alex

866
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Is on the other side of

867
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
We'll never know the truth about all the pharmaceutical pills that this individual was on because the mainstream media is funded by big

868
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,352
Pharmacy you're not allowed to talk about that kind of those photos

869
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
But you know Alex cute here

870
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Let's talk about knee-jerk

871
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
So interesting to do in

872
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
Complaining about the media making

873
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,896
Knee-jerk reactions because 18 seconds

874
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
CUNY jerk reaction

875
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
It's being made by Alex and Owen

876
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
The first is that Owen is asserting that we'll never know what drugs the shooter was on because the media is funded by big Pharma so they don't talk about

877
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,232
In order to make this claim ons to make the knee-jerk assumption that the shooter

878
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,328
In fact was on pharmaceutical drugs something that he has no evidence of them

879
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
Has decided must be true because that's his narrative about eunuch

880
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
He also asserted that the media covers that stuff up because of their funding sources so even if it never comes out that the shooter was on drugs

881
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
Owen can still claim to that knee-jerk reaction

882
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,920
Because the lack of evidence coming out really only

883
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Confirm the power of the cover-up

884
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,624
How to make no further need Durk reaction where he's decided that this trans woman who was the victim of a 4chan hoax

885
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
Because he's desperate to take advantage of

886
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Every opportunity

887
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Did demonize trans people

888
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
He says

889
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:41,632
Let's continue to go through those photos let's enlarge those let's put those on screen please

890
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
Before they take it down

891
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
Alex is making a jerk assumption that these pic

892
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,080
How do you spell Rose to pick the correct suspect that there will be a cover-up these photos

893
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
Because the media doesn't want people to know that the

894
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,247
These ideas that Alexandra disseminating aren't just inaccurate

895
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,367
What they're doing is creating a completely false reality for the audience to understand the shooting Within

896
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
It's really f***** up see how so much of the babe you're there engaging in mirrors past coverage they've done that's gotten them sued

897
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,863
And I suspect the reason for that is because they never needed to learn a lesson

898
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
From those lost

899
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,191
They always knew what they were doing was wrong

900
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
Promise

901
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
I'm starting to kind of feel

902
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,127
Is that like questioning whether a lesson has been learned is almost pointless

903
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,711
Irrelevant yeah because they never needed to learn they know

904
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
This is bad

905
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
Yes yes they're bad people

906
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,391
Who know they're bad but they get a lot of money for it so they are fine

907
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
I want to start doing a one thing I do I push back on you saying evil

908
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Only because I want to try on

909
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Sort of wash that

910
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
From our

911
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,007
Evil morality continuous meditating top prospects

912
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
I don't know I feel like

913
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
I want to I want to banish that

914
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
From Earth

915
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Even though something could be

916
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
Descriptively thought of as evil

917
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
Alex has all this demon s*** and I just wanted to make sure

918
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Stick to science

919
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Math science

920
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:12,511
Nope no ideas about

921
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
About Angels and Demons

922
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
Let me throw it out at

923
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:20,447
Do this way his behaviors as well as theirs are unilaterally destructive and hurtful

924
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Sure

925
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
Now you're getting

926
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:29,407
Close to Stefan molyneux with University preferable behaviors

927
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Alright

928
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,783
They just really like to hurt people

929
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,111
It seems like it's profitable for them and they don't care

930
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,695
Sewing as a as a suggestion of a theory

931
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Nobody wants this

932
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
I don't want kids to go to school

933
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
With armed guards outside

934
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
Believe me I don't want that but I'll tell you this

935
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
I'd rather have

936
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
Schools with armed guards outside

937
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:59,871
Then a situation like we had in Uvalde Texas

938
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Another

939
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Incel

940
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Put those up from the store before they taken down

941
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
When there's a Duda skirt

942
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
There's a dude who he is

943
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
And

944
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
This this is reportedly what's going on

945
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
How to show so

946
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
Again and again we have the range

947
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
We have deranged crazy p

948
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
Skirt identification is

949
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
Kind of important

950
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,775
Because of the main pictures that were going around

951
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,079
There's only one person whose picture

952
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Crews were

953
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Evolve

954
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
When the skirt or dress

955
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,943
So you can tell what

956
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
He's talking about

957
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,087
Pretty clearly alright Instagram picture of the actual shoe

958
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Shooter

959
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
Address

960
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
This Sabrina was the other transpersonal

961
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Who was

962
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
Misidentified

963
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
In the larger

964
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
What is a hoax

965
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
Plot and they weren't shown

966
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
Like there was just

967
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
The face

968
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
In a bottle holding up

969
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
And so like

970
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,871
This is very clearly talking about this Sam

971
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,479
Sam has there to lawyer Sam needs to get Inta contact

972
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
I

973
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,183
Yeah I know I don't know if it's actual but it's definitely the intent of what Alex is doing any pointing to this hoax

974
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Yep

975
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:23,327
So it's a little bit of a baby philosophy lesson he wants to give

976
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
And this is just stupid

977
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
We have deranged

978
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
Crazy p

979
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
And that's the reason we have guns we know one right here

980
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Is a.

981
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Military dagger

982
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
And I'm obviously really love you and your great godmother

983
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
AccuWeather

984
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
But I got up right now

985
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Prophetically

986
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
With this dagger

987
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,111
That is in my hand and I stabbed you with this dagger

988
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
It is not

989
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
The daggers

990
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Bald

991
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
That this took place it is my fault

992
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Weather

993
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Carter run people over

994
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
What are used to baseball bat

995
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Gasolina burning building down

996
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
It is not the fault of the dagger the

997
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
They could be the hands of a good or bad person

998
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
It is the Fault

999
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
And a psychopath

1000
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
And they're just

1001
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Pouring out like

1002
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,479
Well and that that's what it is it's the Godless Society is

1003
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,271
The lack of morals and Society it's

1004
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
The chemicals in the drugs

1005
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,367
Forcing kids into depression it's the hope

1006
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
The New World Order

1007
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,023
It's true enough that it's not the nice fault though and got stabbed in that hypothetical but this is logic

1008
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Jake for babies

1009
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,679
No one's blaming the gun in the sensor that gun itself has any moral consideration in the situation

1010
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:37,055
The argument is that with easy access to very powerful guns the people who are inclined to hurt other people

1011
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
So much easier

1012
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
How much is basically highlighting that by using the knife example here

1013
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:49,087
Speaking someone with a knife is not going to be able to pull off a mass casualty event because people are more likely to be able to and

1014
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Can you be successful in intervening

1015
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:56,255
Further people are less likely to kill random people with a knife because it requires proximity to the person where I shoot

1016
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,815
Someone allows the killer to have a feeling of disc

1017
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,119
Like imagine I'm nice gun

1018
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
We'll probably not

1019
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Be just as big a problem as it gone

1020
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,591
This is an idea that I was expressed enough that the audience was kind of nods and accept

1021
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,895
But it's kind of dumb and it's

1022
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
This is just like

1023
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
Kannada meaningful Arkham

1024
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
Yeah I mean

1025
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,759
Time if you wanted

1026
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
He wants to make it a meaningful art

1027
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
Even if they want to make it a meaningful argument than what they're really trying to Grapple with

1028
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,743
Is that a male-dominated society produces a s*** ton of violin

1029
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Against women

1030
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
And that the

1031
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
Overwhelming

1032
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887
Number of these shooters

1033
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
It isn't driven almost

1034
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
Ultimately

1035
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Bottomley I'd like

1036
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Deeply by massage

1037
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Well

1038
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,455
That is a piece of information the probably isn't known about this shooter at the time of their October

1039
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
What about trend

1040
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Merrily along with gun

1041
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
Another issue

1042
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,975
Be the idea of domestically violent

1043
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Man I mean if you want

1044
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
To tell me that we don't we don't get gunk

1045
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
Control except

1046
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
Men don't get to have guns

1047
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,423
That probably would be better than gun

1048
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
I think I'll run into some trouble there but I definitely think there's something to be said for

1049
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,687
More oversight of people who have had accusations about domestic violence

1050
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,527
Limiting access to weapons so that there's a

1051
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:27,135
That could be done in terms of harm reduction from that front oh yeah but

1052
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
Book tabs

1053
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,815
I can't believe that the Democrats are at all involved

1054
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
With anything that's going on

1055
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,911
We've all given up on

1056
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
All of them

1057
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
It is who gives up

1058
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,543
Do you still need a bad guy if you're Alex

1059
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,383
Samoan political party so it's

1060
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
The best man

1061
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Ghost point

1062
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Spanaway the Democrats

1063
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,319
Our politicians but it is it's the Democrats

1064
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Is the Democrats

1065
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,951
They're calling to take your guns surely you're going to be hearing it for the next 48 hours or all week long

1066
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
They're going to call to take your firearm

1067
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,071
The Democrats when they feel threatened what do they get

1068
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Armed security

1069
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,423
Nancy Pelosi calls for automatic gun turret

1070
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
Machine gun turrets

1071
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
Outside of the capital cuz she feels threatened

1072
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
School at your house

1073
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Or your church

1074
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Or your business

1075
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
They don't want you to have a gun

1076
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
You don't get the protection but they get the

1077
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
The state

1078
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
Bonded taxpayer-funded

1079
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,367
Protection of firearms that they want to take away from us Alex

1080
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,951
Does the same f****** to in these dudes play every time there's a shooting

1081
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:40,351
The dams are at the Gator Guns just you wait tomorrow there's going to be confiscations single time but then nothing happens

1082
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:47,007
They build up entire world use on the insistence and fear that a gun grab is coming right around the corner because I never

1083
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,103
They reap the rewards of their extremism pretending that it's in

1084
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
In defense of Liberty but in fact it's just

1085
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Device

1086
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,735
That story about Nancy Pelosi probably isn't

1087
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,135
It was based on a comment made by Ken cuccinelli to government positions

1088
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Illegally

1089
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Twice

1090
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:10,047
He's an astounding piece of s*** who while Attorney General of Virginia was a proponent of sodomy laws

1091
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,143
Mostly motivated by a belief that homosexuality is against nature picture

1092
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,471
He was also the subject of a scandal at the end of his time serving

1093
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
Department of Homeland

1094
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Insecurities

1095
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
Brian Murphy who is the head of the dhs's intelligence Branch came out as whistleblower saying that senior officials had

1096
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
Directed him to alter intelligence assess

1097
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
From The New York Times

1098
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
Second highest-ranking official Kenneth T cuccinelli ordered Mr Murphy to modify intelligence assessments

1099
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,095
To make the threat of white supremacy appear less severe and include information on violent left-wing groups

1100
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Anti antifa

1101
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,959
If you read the report mr. Murphy filed its really outrageous

1102
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
Here's another thing that cuccinelli was said to have done

1103
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
In December 2019 Mr Murphy attended a meeting with misters cuccinelli and Glau to discuss intelligence

1104
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
Sports regarding conditions in Guatemala Honduras

1105
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
And El Salvador

1106
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:09,439
The intelligence reports were designed to help Asylum officers render better determinations regarding their legal standard

1107
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,999
Bishop Murphy's team at the DHS

1108
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,791
Intelligence agency

1109
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Completed the intelligence reports

1110
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,399
And presented them to mr. cuccinelli in the meeting

1111
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:25,055
Mr. Murphy defended the work in his reports but Mr cuccinelli stayed if you wanted changes to the information outlining Hi-Lo

1112
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,335
Levels of corruption violence

1113
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,407
And poor economic conditions in these three respected country

1114
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,247
Mr. cuccinelli expressed frustration with the intelligence report

1115
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,879
Antique used unknown deep State intelligence analyst of compiling the intelligence information

1116
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,207
To undermine President Donald J Trump's policy objectives

1117
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
With respect

1118
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Do Asylum

1119
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
So sure

1120
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:51,679
People who may be in favor of tighter gun regulation may also have armed security for themselves if that's

1121
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
Fair enough but it doesn't mean anything

1122
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Armed security guard license

1123
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
Stan's not like

1124
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,847
Armed security guards are just random people

1125
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
That someone knows who happen

1126
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,431
Get a posse together as your arms

1127
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Obscurity

1128
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
That's what it says about Pelosi wanting machine gun

1129
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,319
I'm not going to believe anything that cuccinelli says without proof

1130
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
But I guess that's enough for Owen

1131
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,439
Raising assholes wants to Outlaw being gay said this thing

1132
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
So it must

1133
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Be true

1134
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,583
Also I really don't care Ted Nugent doesn't allow guns at his

1135
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Concert so far

1136
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
F*** you f*** off

1137
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
You're done

1138
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,567
F*** you I will get to Ted Nugent a little bit later that's what I know I know that it's coming up and it's just a huge f*** you

1139
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
That you're going to say that

1140
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,431
20 minutes before

1141
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
It's just

1142
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
Why doesn't reality get a say

1143
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,391
Not even like once a on the show

1144
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
Percocet info

1145
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:51,071
I know but like it should have like one little moment there's any like a little flashing light that just going like

1146
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,375
Surprise Isabel it's just something

1147
00:52:53,887 --> 00:53:00,031
Just some represent Palestine reality into a back room

1148
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,847
Ford Taurus is sold.

1149
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
That's not going to happen no

1150
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
A white the shooter was a crazy leftist

1151
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,759
Another deranged crazy leftist

1152
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
That

1153
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,879
Story interchanging every 5 minutes

1154
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
Just went and killed

1155
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
20

1156
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
1 people 18

1157
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Children at Almont

1158
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
What type of

1159
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Demon

1160
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
Is being chased by the police and things

1161
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Okay

1162
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
I'll just turn into this parking lot

1163
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,239
And I'm the one to a school until a bunch of

1164
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Small children

1165
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
I mean this is all

1166
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
The paws

1167
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
And now

1168
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
Suddenly lazy

1169
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
The gentleman

1170
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Lauderdale

1171
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
68 days

1172
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
For the midterms just like we predicted

1173
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,183
It's now happening

1174
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:55,583
I don't know what Alex even means by leftist anymore so this kind of Falls flat for me in terms of how you even respond to that

1175
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
We know that the shooter was a horrific misogynist and threatened to rape and murder a bunch of women over the social media app yubo

1176
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,055
But that's not Behavior that's necessarily specific

1177
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Take to the left or right

1178
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,919
We know that he bought multiple guns and seems to really like guns a lot

1179
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
John ownership is certainly not

1180
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,479
Specific

1181
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,039
Once we were consistently

1182
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Occupied with gun

1183
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
From the available information I don't know who be appropriate to try to nail down any political ideology that the shooter ascribe to

1184
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
It'll be

1185
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,583
Further as a leap to attribute the shooting to any particular political motivation

1186
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:33,727
More information may come out on that front end time but as it's just making that up and ordered a lump

1187
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
The shooter in with his political enemies

1188
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:40,383
And honestly it's probably mostly based on the hoax pictures of trans women that he got from 4chan

1189
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
That's probably what he's facing

1190
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:46,271
Also you again about supplying that the shooting has something to do with the midterms

1191
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
In order for what

1192
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Anything to mean anything

1193
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:54,975
You really have to believe that he's implying some kind of for knowledge on the part of the Democrats are globalists or even that they

1194
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Cause the shooting

1195
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,911
I want to say there was a lull in mass shootings and then now magically just before the midterm they're happening again but even though it is contradicted

1196
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
Already

1197
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
Pointing out there been over 200 mass shootings already in 20

1198
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
22

1199
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:12,639
According to the gun violence archive there were 692 mass shootings in 2021 and

1200
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
610 in 2020

1201
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,063
These numbers actually represent an increase over previous years with 417 and 2019

1202
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
336

1203
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
In 2018

1204
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,415
And one of the things today is

1205
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
Is kind of

1206
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Locating about this

1207
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,815
Is the specific criteria of what constitutes a mass shooting

1208
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
And so you have a lot of these

1209
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
But in terms

1210
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
Of things like the school shooting

1211
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
Events happened in Uvalde

1212
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
There are less of

1213
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
That kind of an event

1214
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,871
Perhaps because schools were closed yeah

1215
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
4A.

1216
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
So there is

1217
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
You could argue a dip

1218
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,015
Innocence

1219
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
In terms of gross numbers of mass shooter

1220
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
There's not been

1221
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,951
I was just making up the idea that there haven't been mass shootings

1222
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:03,583
It's because he doesn't know or care and acting like this is a thing that just mysteriously started happen again for the midterms

1223
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,655
Allows him to get his audience to think it was probably fake

1224
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,959
Without him having to take the responsibility of saying

1225
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,055
Yeah he's got a proven track record so now he can just kind of

1226
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
2.28

1227
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:18,175
You remember when I said all this stuff I'm pointing to saying that stuff but I'm not

1228
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,479
Saying it anymore because I might get sued

1229
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,503
Although I f******

1230
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
I'm saying it fuc

1231
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,551
Who cares nobody gives

1232
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Alex does make it a bun

1233
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
Italy clear that he believes

1234
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,415
The shooting happened in the people died

1235
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
So we do have that

1236
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Sure

1237
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,767
But he is also playing fast

1238
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
And loose with

1239
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
Is this orc

1240
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
Castrated is it a false flag

1241
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
It's just that Gross Middle Ground

1242
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
Bulshit that means nothing

1243
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
No it's not the Sandy Hook case

1244
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Consumer cell phone

1245
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
So Alex

1246
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
When is hosting with him

1247
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
And is

1248
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Drum that you've beat

1249
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Eating is

1250
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Pills

1251
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
Psych meds

1252
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Can't Pharmaceutical

1253
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Procreate

1254
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,903
Will you can go back into the seventies and you still had

1255
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Rifle classes

1256
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
At the average high school

1257
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,279
And you had high school students bringing guns

1258
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
The school they would bring their rifles

1259
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Keep it in the locker that way

1260
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
With normal behavior and it wasn't considered a threat because you didn't have a bunch of kids on pills and

1261
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
Because

1262
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
And and here's here's my fear because there seems to be mystery still about the whole Grandma aspect in the odd thing reruns way

1263
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:27,039
Play crashes a car runs into the school seen firsthand I've experienced this from

1264
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
Friends of mine

1265
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Where

1266
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,671
They'll start taking the pharmaceutical pills

1267
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
Doesn't even matter what kind of mean

1268
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:40,095
Xanax Ritalin like there's all kinds of different things it's all the same stuff and I witnessed in my own

1269
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Friends group

1270
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Before

1271
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,727
We're friends of mine who never were on the

1272
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
Psychotropic drugs in high school

1273
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
Never exhibited any odd behavior

1274
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
We got in the college

1275
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,663
They started taking the psychotropic drugs

1276
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
Because the doctor

1277
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Prescribed it to them

1278
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
College C

1279
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Seems to be a friend

1280
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
But half College in Toronto

1281
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
These pills now

1282
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,855
And an attitude mediately I noticed

1283
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,903
Destructive Behavior but what it is is that

1284
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
It's like a tumbling a

1285
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
So it's like they'll do one thing destructive

1286
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
And then they'll do another thing and it's like there's

1287
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:17,215
Worse and worse

1288
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,359
What are passing bills to kill babies a couple weeks after their born

1289
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
And we wonder why people do things like this

1290
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:31,551
Real quick people are trying to kill babies after they're born I don't see how that's connected to this shooting

1291
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,903
Is Alex trying to suggest that the shooter was motivated by anger but abortion

1292
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,279
Or is this just a spiritual thing we're because there's abortions in the United States this evil has been visited upon us

1293
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,583
Yeah it's just in the air

1294
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
Stupid

1295
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
Yeah

1296
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,471
These numbers to other countries where abortion is available

1297
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,567
The Derby shootings all the time like there is here

1298
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,895
To save it countries where abortion is outright ban

1299
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,967
And would probably be the most prosperous shooting

1300
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,831
Complete victory in accordance with God's wishes and so they are protect

1301
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
Can from all harm like a rock

1302
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,975
So the argument Owen is trying to make here based on his experience

1303
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,327
College is that the shooter was on the psychotropic drugs which apparently have a tumbling of

1304
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,887
A fact where you do one destructive thing and then you do another

1305
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,007
So the thinking here is that he shot his grandmother and then the tumble was that he shot up the school

1306
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:29,919
That's a fun fantasy for Owen but in reality the shooter 10th messages on Facebook prior to leaving his house by his plant shoot

1307
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
Grandmother and then chew people up

1308
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
What school

1309
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
Also there's literally no evidence that the shooter was on psych meds and you get a pretty strong sense that he almost certainly was not when you consider

1310
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
There is living situation

1311
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,487
And how unlikely that it would be that he would have access to mental health care

1312
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,071
Also psych meds don't cause the behavior that Owen is describing

1313
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
He just had a friend who had some problems

1314
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,911
Medication for it

1315
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,727
Instead of trying to look at the broader picture because he's dumb

1316
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:58,079
Any need something to blame for this tragedy other than guns and domestically Violent Men

1317
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
Answer this is the outcome that you get you demonize

1318
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,991
Certain vulnerable communities you demonize the idea of

1319
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Appropriate mental health care and

1320
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
I don't know it seems.

1321
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:15,231
You know it's not it's not a clever observation but it does seem to be one that is

1322
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
Impossible in America but

1323
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
If you don't

1324
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Deal with the route

1325
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
Cause of a problem

1326
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Then you're only going to

1327
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Create more problems

1328
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,959
And exacerbate the root cause of

1329
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,031
And that's what America is

1330
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
And Alex facility

1331
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Exact

1332
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Yeah

1333
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,407
There's one thing I agree with Al

1334
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
And its meaning

1335
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,527
But Alex does say that this shooting

1336
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
Looks suspicious

1337
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,415
The police on their response

1338
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
Yeah I agree

1339
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
Some stuff that's suspicious here

1340
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,303
I think the suspicions that Alex and I have

1341
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
Might diverge B sure but I

1342
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,423
Just going to give that as a meaningless

1343
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
We agree that there was some suspicious variable

1344
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
They're Fair

1345
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,079
The globalists have lost the gun control debate

1346
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
People understand that

1347
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Because there are psycho

1348
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
The pass

1349
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Like this

1350
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
Is the reason we need gun

1351
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
Is the reason we need to protect her

1352
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Ourselves and I'm sorry

1353
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
Big Public Schools

1354
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,647
Elementary schools for these demons are now targets

1355
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Just like I said

1356
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,743
You're going to see a white supremacist act on a black grocery store

1357
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,791
Because you can see the pre-programming you can

1358
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Can pick it up

1359
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
You can see what's going whoever's behind it how do we predict that

1360
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,703
My answer is lead are studying in this whole thing is very

1361
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
For the midterms

1362
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
Coming up

1363
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
Oliver on psychotropic

1364
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
How you take the guy for

1365
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
From the Parkland shooting

1366
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
Dozens of times he was going to kill people

1367
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Screws That Couldn't arrest him

1368
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
Because I'm a

1369
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
George Soros

1370
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Appointed

1371
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,647
Arlington district attorney

1372
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,207
And I'm not saying it didn't happen we're saying

1373
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
They let him do it

1374
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
Answer same story over and over again

1375
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:59,679
What are the things that really sucks is that because of the police response on the way that the story shifted over the days immediately after the shooting

1376
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:04,287
Alex is consistent narrative about these things becomes a little bit easier for people to accept

1377
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
Whenever he's not feeling very ambitious it doesn't want to make too bold of a statement Alex will always say that the police ordered to stand down

1378
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
Surrounding events

1379
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Like mass shooting

1380
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:19,135
He says that all the time and he's always making it up but because of the particular details of this police response

1381
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,207
He may be able to convince some people that he's got the goods on this one

1382
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
Order a stand down

1383
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,767
Not really

1384
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,047
Italic

1385
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,863
Not in the way that Alex uses the term

1386
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
Again this will be more of an issue for it

1387
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
Future episodes

1388
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:39,103
The reason I bring it up now is because I like season saying that on the immediate area

1389
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
When ironically yeah considering that this would have been the one time the Optics of

1390
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,087
Of it and the things surrounding it make the argument of

1391
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
Be what Alec means by a stand down

1392
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
I mean

1393
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,279
Maybe even more the colloquial meaning of a sand down as opposed to Alec

1394
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,607
Texas specific meaning of a stand down

1395
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:03,167
The cops ordered don't do anything

1396
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
That is what we are talkin

1397
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:11,359
Alex is talking about the cops ordered we don't do anything because the globalist told us to so we can get as many kids

1398
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Today we get gun control or whatever

1399
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,271
Those are differences

1400
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
Morita detailing

1401
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
Butter shooter episode

1402
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,671
All that being said I was basically wrong about everything you saying In that clip

1403
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:31,071
Shooters are always on psychotropic drugs there's no evidence of this shooter was and while Nicholas Crews had taken meds in

1404
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,167
In the past there's no evidence that he had for approximately a year before the shooting

1405
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,287
This is the standard talking point a gun fanatic used to derail conversations about shootings but it's not based

1406
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
In reality

1407
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:46,175
The Broward County State Attorney is currently Harold Pryor but he was elected in 2020

1408
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,735
That the office was filled by Michael sat

1409
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:53,343
The Narrative that Alex is going off of his about how Soros is paying to get prosecutors

1410
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
Diaz put in office

1411
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
Will follow is

1412
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
Instructions but with sap

1413
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
That doesn't make sense

1414
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,279
Absentee been office in that office since 1970s

1415
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:08,703
Alex also has a talking point about how they couldn't arrest Nikolas Cruz because he had a Hispanic last name but this is just Alex being racist

1416
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:13,311
In reality this is referring to the fact that in Middle School Crews have been

1417
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,127
Vandalize the school bathroom

1418
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,247
And instead of getting arrested he was referred to an alternative disciplinary program called Promise

1419
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,599
Students who do things that are bad but not super bad

1420
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,903
And make sure that their mistake doesn't bring them into the

1421
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
The criminal justice

1422
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
The system

1423
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,767
Cruise never completed that program but the fact that he was sent to this

1424
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
Instead of getting arrested for a misdemeanor vandalism charge

1425
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,911
Has nothing to do with the shooting and has nothing to do with his last name

1426
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,567
This is just a racist or real could come up with do we have a compelling story for his audience who are always hungry for races story

1427
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
And that's

1428
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,687
What is anxiety throws around a lot

1429
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
Accessible

1430
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
Everything that he has surrounding

1431
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
Shootings basically is all bulge

1432
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,135
Yeah it's all bulshit and it's self-aggrandizing

1433
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
And it's

1434
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
Contributing to the

1435
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,743
The problem I mean you're you're demonizing

1436
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,327
Neuro atypical people in trying

1437
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
To keep them from getting medication

1438
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
Your your diva nicety

1439
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,287
Wide swaths of anybody who just doesn't want to

1440
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
Old s*** tons of guns

1441
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:22,175
And then at the end of it you're saying like we got to keep guns

1442
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,455
So

1443
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
Andrew putting more cops in schools in

1444
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,343
Increasing the risk of a shooting and you're creating

1445
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,183
Sphere where discussion of

1446
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Sensible

1447
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
Gun regulation

1448
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
Everybody's guns are to be taken

1449
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
You can't buy a gun ever again

1450
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
Yeah

1451
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:45,983
Kind of conversation is more likely to lead to outbreaks

1452
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
Violence

1453
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,335
Because of the tenor of the conversation that happens

1454
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
On Alex's show

1455
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,687
Because of The Sensational ization of this coverage

1456
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
The prospect of making

1457
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
Can progress towards a better status

1458
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
This quote sure people can't stay armed

1459
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Responsibly

1460
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
And we make it more difficult

1461
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
For people who

1462
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,719
Have a propensity or

1463
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
Are more likely to commit violent

1464
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
Guns

1465
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
I have a harder time getting it

1466
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
Will

1467
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,423
That the conversation surrounding I will

1468
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,983
Just end up driving for my dead body

1469
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,519
Well it's important to

1470
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,847
It's important to look at the way that they talked about this

1471
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,895
And if you think about the NRA

1472
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,943
The NRA and its behaviors

1473
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,991
Identical to

1474
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
F******

1475
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,343
Philip Morris or whatever when smoking was going on

1476
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
Whatever we know if you get us

1477
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
Any regulation

1478
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
Contort smoking

1479
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,535
Then we feel like it's going to go away forever so we have to go is

1480
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
Crazy as we can

1481
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
You can't

1482
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,887
You can't smoke on a plane they went f******

1483
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
Over all of that

1484
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,447
Add stop because if you get

1485
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
One little thing in there

1486
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,847
Then they're worried about that they think because it is

1487
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
F****** knew it well and

1488
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
People

1489
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
Who were actually opposed

1490
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,247
To sort of some of those

1491
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
Restrictions about

1492
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Smoking

1493
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Once they actually came into effect I think

1494
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Score for them

1495
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,695
I remember when I lived in Columbia Missouri

1496
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,511
When they were having an indoor smoking ban

1497
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,303
And I remember I went to

1498
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
The bar I always used to go to Eastside Tavern

1499
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,911
Yeah you can smoke inside it was great

1500
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,215
You know you'd get drunk to do karaoke

1501
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Smoke

1502
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,359
And I remember being very hostile towards the idea of a smoking ban go outside

1503
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
And then six months later

1504
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
I loved by loved

1505
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,159
Right right right I couldn't see that possibility because I was

1506
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:44,255
I was holding on to my absolutism about being able to

1507
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,815
Have a drink and a smoke

1508
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,679
That's part of the reason why you do these industries Maybe

1509
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Worried about

1510
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,055
Because people might realize I we prefer it on the other side of this

1511
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
And and again it's because

1512
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
Cuz they know they're killing

1513
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,175
That's why they're so f***

1514
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,991
Talking Angry in trying to stop any kind of adjustment

1515
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
It's because they know

1516
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

1517
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
They are murderers

1518
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,391
Craps

1519
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,951
So here's a dumb s***

1520
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
Well and it just becomes really it becomes a media phenomenon where they just

1521
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Just picking shoes

1522
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
Switch shootings that they won

1523
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
Want to cover in which

1524
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,959
They cannot cover this at all and most people have no idea happen

1525
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
That's what

1526
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,031
Happens with 99% of mass shootings

1527
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
This country

1528
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Is they don't

1529
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,615
Don't cover it and so nobody knows it

1530
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
But then they picked

1531
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Can choose the ones

1532
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
But there's one solution I mean

1533
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,783
There is only one solution to this out

1534
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
And that is you have to have arms

1535
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,415
Security that's just the fact I don't like it

1536
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
Ecology School

1537
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,279
There has to be armed security everywhere this is just Next Level stupid

1538
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,167
Like I wonder if I can think of any situation where there was a shooting in the US where a bunch of elementary school kids were murdered

1539
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,703
An immediate didn't cover it

1540
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
So we

1541
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
Just no idea

1542
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:05,407
I sincerely wonder what Owen thinks is going on in the world if that's something he's going to say with a straight face on this show

1543
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,271
Many shootings well obviously sad and something that should be taken seriously are locally

1544
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
They Don't Really concern people outside of a certain geographical region so they don't often get much media attention from National

1545
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,975
Even outside of their news mark

1546
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:25,887
A lot of mass shootings don't result in deaths and often there aren't even severe injuries that isn't really something that like CNN is

1547
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Going to cover

1548
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,471
Conversely something like a shooting with over a dozen

1549
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,055
Child fatalities at an elementary school is going to get a lot of coverage

1550
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:39,967
An absolute tragedy that where wherever you live nearby or not whether you know anyone in Uvalde or not

1551
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
You're going to feel that

1552
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
I am a we grieved

1553
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
Together

1554
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,111
And let's imagine the scenario that Owens talking about

1555
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
What's my agenda

1556
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
The shooting happened

1557
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,719
And and all the major national media didn't even touch it

1558
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
Do you think for a second that wouldn't

1559
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Become the next Infowars

1560
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Conspiracy

1561
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,399
If the media covers a story they're pushing an agenda if they don't cover the

1562
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
The story they're engaged in a cover-up

1563
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:05,311
There's no situation where response to a mass shooting will ever satisfy people like Alex and Owen

1564
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,615
Because there are acting from a sincere position

1565
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,919
None of these things are actual argument

1566
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,039
There's a performance of the normal deflection that used to bully people out of talking about guns

1567
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
In the aftermath of

1568
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
A tragedy

1569
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
That's what the point about armed security

1570
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,743
Let School District had all sorts of policies in place already and they didn't do any

1571
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,815
Get our police are on the scene and it didn't do anything

1572
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Stop it

1573
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:32,191
In 2019 Governor Abbott signed a law that was passed to allow teachers to be armed

1574
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Created measures

1575
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,007
The Jardin Des curity at school

1576
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,127
This was after a mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Houston left 10 people dead

1577
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,663
And there was pressure on Abbott

1578
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
To do something

1579
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:48,063
According to the Associated Press they did all this stuff about hardening the schools because it was preferable to the alternative

1580
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,975
Efforts to create so-called red flag laws to keep guns away from people deem to be dangerous themselves

1581
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,023
Penalties for negligent home storage

1582
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,791
Were defeated

1583
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,863
Solutions offered by Owen and Alex aren't solution

1584
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:06,495
They're just like the Texas government passing laws to harden schools to avoid addressing gun related issues

1585
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:12,383
Alex and Order creating their own fake solution so they don't have to get into territory that directly implicates their own ideology

1586
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
It should not

1587
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,527
Require superhuman intellect

1588
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:23,647
To look at an arms race and think escalation is only going to

1589
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
Escalate problem

1590
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
So if your arms race

1591
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,023
This is these kids are coming into schools with guns

1592
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,631
Wasn't killing people so I'm going to escalate by putting armed security out front well

1593
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:37,983
Now the kids who want to go murder people are going to have to find a way to deal with your armed security outfit

1594
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
So then they do that

1595
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,079
So then what happened what do we arm next

1596
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,383
Why do we give the f****** kids gun

1597
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,687
It's only going to escalate

1598
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,295
If you act like they didn't Alex see the end of Batman Begins

1599
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,903
It's insane how you know he has

1600
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
It shouldn't be

1601
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,743
It's so f****** stupid

1602
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
It is

1603
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,143
Stupid it is all of their ideas are nonsensical because they're not meant to make sense absolutely

1604
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,495
But imagine if you had you don't have to arm every teacher but

1605
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,031
The teachers that want to get arms

1606
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Take a class habit

1607
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,591
Concealed carry make sure they're armed

1608
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
One time

1609
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,735
One time a shooter tries to go into a school and gets his head blown off by an armed teacher guess what

1610
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
School shootings are over with

1611
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,063
Because they know it's not a soft target

1612
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
2 Chainz are less than 100 people a year

1613
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,463
It's terrible we only children killed

1614
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
It was 350 million people and is still

1615
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,095
Mystical anomaly and something there I

1616
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
I thought like last week we were mad at schools because the teachers are pushing CRT and trying to groom

1617
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Students

1618
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
And now they should have guns

1619
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,151
We want the teachers who teach trt

1620
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,431
To be shot with gun

1621
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
And we want the teachers who don't

1622
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Hcr2

1623
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,527
Do have the guns to shoot

1624
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Is that make sense

1625
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
No

1626
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,719
It's always really coming off is about the stupidest a****** imaginable on the show

1627
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:09,119
You really expect me to buy that wants one teacher shoot someone trying to do a school shooting the problem will solve itself cuz we've

1628
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:14,239
People know that schools are soft targets I honestly can't stress how stupid this is enough

1629
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
Very dumb

1630
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,663
Oh I mean it was imagine if a shooter was killed in the act of a mass shooting then they it didn't all the future

1631
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
Shooters with no like we're not going to survive

1632
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:28,319
Sure for one thing the other place that Alex and the crew always refer to a soft target

1633
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Churches

1634
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,719
Do you know his logic one would think that the minute someone trying to do a shooting at a church was

1635
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
Confronted by good guys with guns

1636
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,375
People shoot up churches

1637
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,751
The Sutherland Springs shooting in 2017 with stop by Stephen willeford

1638
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,847
And our neighbor who came to help and yet there have been church shooting son

1639
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,711
There's another one in Texas even in 2019 at the West Freeway Church of Christ

1640
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,783
Bernard volunteer security guard killed the shooter made attack

1641
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,855
And yet even after that there have still been church shooting

1642
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,439
Just this month there was a shooting at the Geneva Presbyterian

1643
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
Syrian Church in Laguna Woods

1644
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,743
California

1645
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,095
The fact that aspiring Church Shooters have run into our resistance

1646
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:17,471
Emily hasn't made the dining of the dramatic impact own is pretending that it would and shootings continue

1647
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,055
To imagine that a difference exists with schools

1648
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Pure Fantasy

1649
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
It's not

1650
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,687
Another thing to consider is that most Shooters don't expect to survive their toy

1651
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,503
Many of them kill themselves rather than allowing

1652
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,039
Themselves to get caught so I don't

1653
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:35,647
Take care of that much if there's a good guy with a gun there who kills them after they've been able to do a bunch

1654
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,695
Cuz really their goal

1655
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,511
I thought these dudes are supposed to be against the prison

1656
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,327
Planet Mobility Rising the society

1657
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Turn schools into army base

1658
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
F****** stupid

1659
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
If your argument is

1660
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,543
Remember there's only 100 Kids Country of 350 million

1661
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
Then your argument should be don't

1662
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
Do anything

1663
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:01,759
Not like because your acceptable already know

1664
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
Police in schools

1665
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:09,439
Leads to more kids being arrested for no f****** reason leads to more trauma all of those active shooter drills

1666
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:15,839
Only traumatize children and they clearly

1667
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,399
So if your argument is it's nobody

1668
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,751
Then don't do anything cuz you're only traumatizing more children to do nothing

1669
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
For the children were going to be murdered

1670
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,615
Can you create more of an environment that sort of

1671
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
It feels carceral

1672
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:33,247
F*** that'll detector isn't all over school like it's

1673
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
It's not

1674
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
At my partner School

1675
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
The day after

1676
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
What happened

1677
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:45,023
Did they have a communal session did everybody come together and grieve did anybody even talked about their issues

1678
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,095
Nope what happened was every single kid

1679
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,143
Walk through the door was searched

1680
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
Viciously went through a metal detector

1681
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,543
With question with all of this s*** and then told to go about their day

1682
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,079
Nothing they didn't

1683
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,871
They didn't take my proposal

1684
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Which AI

1685
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,175
A pitch to Alex actually

1686
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,759
And that is that every school

1687
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
Room

1688
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
Is equipped with a

1689
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
The mine

1690
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,623
I like that the teacher teaches

1691
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:13,183
With their finger right over a remote

1692
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
X

1693
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,815
Totally yeah that's the only way to be truly safe

1694
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
And even then you want to be able to contain the problem so you got one mind in every classroom so if somebody goes into the classroom sure you have

1695
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:30,335
To sacrifice everybody in there babe

1696
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,639
To keep everybody else safe so you got to have that

1697
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
Sure

1698
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,687
So dumb

1699
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,247
So but like Alex what he's doing there like

1700
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Vertiv

1701
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,343
Talk about it

1702
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,623
Statistics

1703
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
Really shity

1704
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,511
You might notice that he never does that when it comes to like let's say crimes committed by immigrants

1705
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,815
I'll take a single incident like that

1706
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,351
Extrapolate that out until being the

1707
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:56,191
The greatest alien society and proof that we need closed militarized border

1708
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,799
What year when a bunch of schoolkids are murdered he implores you to put the numbers in perspective

1709
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,383
Because he's a callow piece of s*** just trying to push his right-wing

1710
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,943
Politics has nothing to do

1711
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,039
With the reality of the statistics or anything like that he's an opportunist

1712
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,063
Yep

1713
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
These people are a f******

1714
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Blight

1715
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
A f******

1716
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
Blight

1717
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
So Alex

1718
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,327
I don't know if you know this but he moonlights as a FBI profiler

1719
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,631
At least that's the sense that I got from listen

1720
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
Going on

1721
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,567
People just leave are being told I'm not saying

1722
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
The story

1723
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
Changing all the time

1724
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Dad

1725
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
But imagine it has been a white

1726
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,295
Drug addict

1727
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,087
Video game at

1728
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,391
I'm not bashing anybody likes video games

1729
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
We're saying the profile is

1730
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
God can't get a girlfriend

1731
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,303
Has a girlfriend break up with him

1732
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,863
Who is generally a nerd

1733
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
A trendy

1734
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
Who is on psychotropic

1735
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,495
Agenda Satanism as got finished the Bell

1736
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
That then somehow is

1737
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Spiritually guide

1738
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
Kill children I mean why

1739
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
Would you go

1740
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
And do this

1741
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,223
Why would you kill innocent children

1742
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,503
What is going on in

1743
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,271
Selfishness

1744
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,831
True demonic evil

1745
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,391
And the answer is not giving our guns up

1746
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,183
When the Children of the name Oscar

1747
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,487
And the children of the Democratic Party

1748
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,535
And the children of the abortion industry

1749
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
And the children of this whole church

1750
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
Are out there running rampid

1751
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,239
It's a surrender to say

1752
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,799
We're going to give up our weapons like oh somebody

1753
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,335
Be somebody for their fifth

1754
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,871
Cut my hands off

1755
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
It's a fraud we know it's afro

1756
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,223
No but if someone created a fist

1757
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:49,855
Gun you might want to kill people

1758
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,207
The children of the abortion industry

1759
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
Eastern Annex

1760
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,327
So I that.

1761
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:05,727
Small correction it seems odd for him to struggle getting into the mind of somebody who wants to kill innocent children

1762
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,799
Considering every time he looks at his daughter he says to her

1763
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:14,431
I am willing to accept that you will die in a mass shooting in order to make sure that I still get to hang on to all my

1764
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,711
My guns in that closet over

1765
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:21,087
So at the end of the day you are life is worth less than those guns over there just in case you were wondering

1766
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,391
Every morning when we say hi

1767
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
I love those guns more than you being alive

1768
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
I wonder

1769
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
I know

1770
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,351
I don't know if Alex is current

1771
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
Child is homeschool

1772
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,983
I know that his other kids went to public school

1773
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Play I wonder

1774
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311
Yeah philosophically they

1775
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
This should be

1776
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
Yes but I guess I don't really care I don't know why I went off on that

1777
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:53,599
So Alex still pictures of the

1778
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Trans woman

1779
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,671
Are the shooter

1780
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
Gets dumb

1781
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,743
Well and there's a reason why

1782
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,815
If you look up a pharmaceutical

1783
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,191
It's the origins of

1784
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,471
Pharmaceutical Farm

1785
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Ikea which is

1786
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
Old Latin origins of

1787
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
Evil

1788
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,384
And so that's why I pharmaceutical snake

1789
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
In their logo be

1790
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,200
Because they know sorry what

1791
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
Feeding you

1792
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
Evil pills

1793
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
Holland's Got This Wrong

1794
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:26,624
Pharmaceuticals drive both from Latin and Greek and the word just test

1795
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
To do with drugs

1796
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,720
One thing it's interesting those when you look at the Greek root words

1797
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Because in Greek

1798
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,328
You have the word pharmakeia

1799
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,888
Which can be translated as a poisoner

1800
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,424
A sorcerer

1801
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,728
Just because the word pharmakon

1802
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,520
Is a bit of a catch-all meaning things

1803
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
From drugs

1804
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
The poison

1805
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:50,944
Dispels an enchantment

1806
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
Exist within live and where the word pharmacia can mean both killing or harming medicines

1807
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
A magical potion

1808
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,952
The belief is that this word is based on something that predates Greek

1809
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:06,816
And there's a phenomenon among archaic languages where the words for like poison and medicine or off

1810
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
I'm the same

1811
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Differentiated by context

1812
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
Austin surrounding word

1813
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
It's not super uncommon

1814
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:17,568
These languages

1815
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
He's going to be

1816
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,432
There is a ton of words for evil in Latin and Greek

1817
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
Depending on what sort of

1818
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,016
Evil you're talking about but pharmakeia is not one of them

1819
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,600
Also snakes aren't the symbol of medicine because of some connections

1820
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Evil

1821
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
There's a

1822
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:35,232
Referring to two symbols that are often used to denote medicine

1823
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:38,048
The caduceus and the rod of it

1824
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Sleepiest

1825
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:45,472
The first one is a snake coiled around a pool and the other one is the two snakes entwined around a staff that has wings at the top

1826
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,312
One of the very obvious connections here is that

1827
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,616
Asclepius is the Greek god of

1828
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Healing and

1829
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
12

1830
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,688
So that's Peppa Pig party

1831
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,248
There are also two main reasons

1832
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,552
Why the snake has become a symbol in the meadow

1833
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Medical field

1834
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,880
The first is that in the Book of Numbers

1835
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,672
People lose their faith

1836
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
The wilderness

1837
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,744
Start speaking out against God and Moses

1838
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
I got some fire snakes to bite people

1839
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,632
When the people realize the error of their ways and bake Moses

1840
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
For help

1841
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,240
21 verses 7 & 8

1842
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,568
Quote therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned

1843
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
For we have spoken against the Lord

1844
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Then against the

1845
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpent

1846
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
It's from us

1847
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,504
And Moses prayed for the people

1848
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,296
And the Lord said unto Moses

1849
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,112
Make me a fiery Serpent and set it up on a pole

1850
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,928
And it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten

1851
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
When he look it up on it she'll live

1852
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,768
There's a Biblical root

1853
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,584
To one of the primary reasons that the snake is associated with the

1854
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
The symbology for medicine

1855
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,960
The other reason is the metaphor of a snake shedding its skin and going

1856
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,008
Old and weary too young a new again which

1857
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
Is analogous to the doctors gold

1858
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
People

1859
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:59,968
How do I own is just made up a bunch of dumb s*** or maybe you read it on the dumb blog and he's pretending that it means anything

1860
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:06,368
And using it to demonize psych meds which consists were to blame for the shooting even though he has actually no idea if they are

1861
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,136
He's dumb

1862
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
And a piece of s***

1863
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
Moses is God was a lot more metal

1864
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,376
You know fiery snake

1865
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,168
Kind of Christian Rocky but

1866
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
God was f******

1867
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:25,568
Metal there's a strength in silence and poised and not using fire snakes

1868
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,408
Yeah I always just love it when

1869
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:35,296
They they do meme etymology

1870
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,112
It sounds smart to people who don't

1871
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,136
No

1872
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,560
Yeah exactly two other people they would work on

1873
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,096
Play Alex Steele

1874
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,912
Pictures of real check

1875
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,960
What are we going to do now

1876
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
That magically there's a shooting last

1877
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
Swinging Buffalo Bayou

1878
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:01,152
And magically now there's this match and by the way the cruise really smart

1879
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,712
Zooming in

1880
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,528
On the stockings the guy was wearing or was

1881
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
The picture behind it

1882
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
Fred Meyer

1883
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
Michigan

1884
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,672
You were showing the incel reported shooter

1885
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,720
Zooming in on his leg

1886
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,256
Then what was it

1887
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,792
Stockings were looking at or

1888
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,424
Oh that's

1889
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,704
Wow I'm dumb

1890
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,496
A handprint

1891
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:32,128
Could be lifted up

1892
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,664
I have no idea what they're talking about

1893
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,992
But because they're talkin about stockings

1894
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,528
And legs

1895
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,088
You know which picture that they referencing

1896
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,648
Again we have this very consistent thread

1897
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,696
Yeah that is talking about this

1898
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,232
Specific hoax

1899
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
This target

1900
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
Write up a hoax right though

1901
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,144
I think you can pretty clearly demonstrate that based on what they're talking about

1902
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
So Alex

1903
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,496
Is is is really dancing around like

1904
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Weather this is space

1905
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
Aged or not

1906
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,616
Send that's because he's a piece of s***

1907
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,456
Look I don't want to say this was staged remark

1908
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
But

1909
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
We have specifically said

1910
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,344
New Year's Worley mass shooting

1911
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,208
That was all the pre-programming that mass shootings are coming and terrorists are going to attack him

1912
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,304
We got to take the guns and I'm like well I would predict a lot of mass shootings

1913
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,376
Right before the election and then like clockwork is happening

1914
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,448
You know Timmy it's just very Opera

1915
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,264
That's the thing Alex

1916
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,616
There have been mass shooting guys plug into a Google Search right now hundred ninety-eight mass shooting

1917
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,920
And it wasn't black

1918
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:46,880
This is convoluted and with the point that Alex is trying to drive that is I don't want to say this was staged book

1919
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,184
Come on guys I really want to say this is staged

1920
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:55,584
I feel like I'm not allowed to say that it's staged anymore and I really do want to say that so I'm going to try and get you

1921
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,144
Kind of give me some cover

1922
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,448
To say that I can speculate about it

1923
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,984
So whenever people are like

1924
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:08,896
Claims that it was fake I can actually say we were just talking about and that's why I was taking a bunch of calls

1925
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:12,224
But also like

1926
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
There's this sense of like

1927
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,064
People think I got I went soft

1928
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
If I take

1929
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:22,464
But also a very serious risk if I go too far in the other direction

1930
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,048
Think I might be able to outlast this lawsuit until we get

1931
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,120
Full fascism in America and then they won't be able to stop

1932
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:35,776
And the other one has to put the brakes on and whipping like there were a bunch of magic

1933
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:42,176
Call fascism then you're probably going to lose that lawsuit

1934
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,224
So he has them pull up

1935
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
The number

1936
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
And it's just

1937
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
When they decide to cover it mean that's all it is

1938
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
When do they decide to cover it

1939
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,072
You don't want to cover it but this one happened like you said tragically at a school

1940
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,608
Mountain of rural area in

1941
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,168
Texas so they figured hey this is a good one to cover

1942
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:08,032
We can use this tragedy

1943
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,872
I said

1944
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,920
I bet it's an incel

1945
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,456
I bet it's a

1946
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
Did the dress

1947
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,808
Like when Dave Chappelle said I just got attacked by a tranny

1948
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
I was

1949
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
And I'm not going to be mean to

1950
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
Statistically these people are

1951
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,768
Have a higher percentage of whacked-out f***

1952
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,096
Income tell it Alex has a little bit of the burpees there

1953
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:35,168
And like he's communicating weird

1954
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,192
Some of the

1955
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,520
It's it's hard to exactly put into words

1956
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
But listening to him talk as much

1957
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:46,176
As I do. This is a this is a weird Tony I had a happy hour after

1958
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,736
Disney Orchestra tired but

1959
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
I don't know

1960
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,064
Again I have no interest in pretending that Owens

1961
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,464
Sincerely doesn't understand why the media would cover the buffalo in Uvalde shooter shootings more than safe or no the BART

1962
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,304
7th shooting in Knoxville Tennessee where four people were injured and no one was killed

1963
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:06,656
It's a false premise owners using any knows damn well the bulshit he's paddling

1964
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:09,728
I was interested in the notion that he put forth

1965
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,288
These mass shootings are all in democrat-controlled inner city

1966
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,616
I wondered if that was true so I decided to analyze

1967
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,456
The date of all the mass shootings this year and see if what Owen was saying was in

1968
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
Anyway I can

1969
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
Here's what

1970
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,856
The first thing I learned is that looking at the numbers like this is stupid

1971
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:30,976
This is a no way a red state-blue State thing nor is it an inner-city rural area issue

1972
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,560
Their mass shootings at smaller cities and their mass shootings in Irving

1973
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,192
I'm not positive this means anything but since I took the time to compile this here are the numbers

1974
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,008
Defining red and blue states by their governor

1975
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,664
4 red states you have 102 mass shootings total with 124 fatalities in 455 in

1976
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:55,808
For blue states you have 114 total mass shootings with 123 fatalities and 408

1977
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
83

1978
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
Overall it's pretty close

1979
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:08,352
That being said Texas was the leader in every category with only California even coming close at

1980
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:15,264
I guess the point is that I was curious about if what Owen was saying that's anything and a Consulting the numbers

1981
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,592
How come to the strong conclusion that he's talking out of his ass which I should have just

1982
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,408
Sometimes you just like

1983
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,968
Make a spreadsheet here

1984
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Yeah it's

1985
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,320
It's so f***** up how far they've won

1986
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,136
That they don't even have to remember

1987
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,928
Hundreds and hundreds of mass shooting

1988
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,512
Like they don't even have to think about it they're surprised

1989
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
It's the third so many mass shooting

1990
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,352
When a large one like this happen

1991
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,168
Alex has to be reminded exactly

1992
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,568
Reminded that he's making s*** up about there not being mass shooting and it's just like man if you guys

1993
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
Bored

1994
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,128
Playing full-court

1995
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Preston

1996
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,688
All of the mass shootings then

1997
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
Man

1998
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,856
Alex gets back to our system

1999
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,904
Limits

2000
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,696
The society in 2K

2001
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,232
Give metal detectors

2002
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
School's out before

2003
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,328
The real thing to do

2004
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,608
Is the arm

2005
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
The teachers in French

2006
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
Fulton hours

2007
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
Showing a mass murderer liked

2008
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,984
Just comes in there who's demonically

2009
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,032
Democratic party going to kill children

2010
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,056
They're obsessed with

2011
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,104
Wiping them or killing them just one Renaissance

2012
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,408
We have a demon problem

2013
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,688
We have a satanic

2014
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,224
Collapse problem the Bible predicts

2015
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
Rolling over

2016
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Saying okay

2017
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,416
You want to try to come after me

2018
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,208
You want to try to kill me

2019
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,488
You want to try to

2020
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,048
Enslave me I am going to defend myself

2021
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,632
Well that's the story I mean we have

2022
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
Lost our moral compass

2023
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,728
Did this is just yet another sign of it

2024
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
Decaying

2025
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Civilization

2026
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,080
Children out killing children

2027
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
You're in a dick

2028
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,872
Kaying

2029
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
Civilization

2030
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,688
Where does someone faint

2031
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:02,272
Okay the cops are chasing me I'm going to go kill Elementary students

2032
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
Sandy Hook

2033
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,856
Everything I cover

2034
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,672
Earlier

2035
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,744
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill

2036
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
Go to elementary school

2037
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
So obvious what they're doing

2038
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,168
This isn't about you prick

2039
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,752
How old is Sam or simply

2040
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,824
Let's just cut it

2041
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:32,736
It's disgusting but that doesn't seem right

2042
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,784
But it's not big enough

2043
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,600
The part about

2044
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,648
Alex thinking that his

2045
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,952
Fusion cause this is

2046
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,816
If they hadn't have criticised me than these shootings would never happen

2047
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:53,216
Ion I mean like I think if I was someone in his life I probably hospitalized and for saying something like that

2048
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
It's indicative of

2049
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,104
Like

2050
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,224
Really troubling thought pattern literally you can't participate

2051
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
Society if I tell you

2052
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,576
Literally everything is about you

2053
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,416
Society can only touch you

2054
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
You can't ever

2055
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,864
You're never on the team society and you can only really understand everything that goes on in the world as an extension of you

2056
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,632
Un

2057
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,680
That's dangerous yeah

2058
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:30,336
No I mean it's it's impossible to argue that he doesn't have a very severe mental

2059
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:34,432
Faculty issue at least a dangerous narcissist

2060
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,456
6th Street

2061
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
Blah

2062
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,272
20 way they decide they're going to take a break

2063
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Like to play some

2064
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
Special Report

2065
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344

2066
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,160
Whenever couple special ports where come back

2067
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928

Steve Martin

2069
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
First off

2070
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,304
Owen would you like to lead us in a prayer for these

2071
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,864
Dead children these dead teachers in the wounded

2072
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
H like me

01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Sure Alex

2074
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
Dear God please be with the

2075
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
Families that are suffering

2076
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
Tonight

2077
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,080
In Uvalde Texas

2078
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,360
And that community

2079
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Please God

2080
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
Protect

2081
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,176
That community

2082
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,968
From the Satanic agenda

2083
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
That is surrounding it

2084
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Right now

2085
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
A little bit of a political Pereira

2086
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,112
This is a little lies

2087
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,928
Man Moses is God really would have blown him

2088
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:23,328
F****** sky-high studio if Moses is God

2089
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
That was real

2090
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,448
God he would explode sewing wraps up his prayer here

2091
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
And protect

2092
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,776
This nation as we are going into the arms

2093
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
Satan Lord

2094
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Please

2095
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:35,872
Protect this nation in Jesus name I pray

2096
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
I'm in all right you're absolutely right

2097
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
Protect our little

2098
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
Are coming

2099
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
For our children

2100
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,320
Every level

2101
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,624
And I am pre-program psychos

2102
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,904
Just like this on

2103
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,928
Turn the temperature down

2104
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,488
They go to kill children to make their final deal

2105
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
With Satan

2106
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
That's what do

2107
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
Weapons

2108
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,144
I'm being informed and watchful

2109
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Defend ourselves

2110
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,960
Good response to a prayer

2111
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:08,128
This reminds me of another Bible story this revised I think it was Elijah

2112
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:12,992
Whenever God and ball we're having a whole argument

2113
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:16,576
Garden ball

2114
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:21,184
So the priests of Baal tried to light this thing on fire using the power of ball

2115
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,024
Right and then Elijah tried to like this thing on fire using the power of God

2116
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,560
So like she does it

2117
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,352
And a ball guys didn't

2118
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,168
And then got killed all the ball guys to just for fun

2119
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
You know just

2120
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,032
Like that would be here's what we do

2121
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
Okay

2122
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,336
Owen can pray

2123
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Right

2124
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,408
And then I get to enact

2125
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,200
Some form of Oz assault weapons ban

2126
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,016
And we'll see which one is more effect

2127
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:52,928
Apparently I think I'll be really difficult to to make

2128
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,232
Alright

2129
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,792
I was thinking you were going to just make up a Bible story

2130
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,096
Call now and I was I was just thinking

2131
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,424
If you ever want to make up a Bible story you should say that it was happy

2132
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
Cuz no one remembers

2133
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,776
Habakuk did

2134
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
What did you do

2135
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
You have no idea I have no idea

2136
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,664
So Special Report

2137
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,688
And then they come back

2138
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,968
Calls

2139
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,248
This guy

2140
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,808
Seems like his tone is not good

2141
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,904
What start with Sean in Nebraska with I think

2142
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,952
A couple dollars on this issue it's

2143
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
It's the biggest cover-up when it comes to these shootings and that's

2144
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,864
What's the pharmaceutical drug free time one of these cells

2145
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
And so I can travel

2146
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,704
Go ahead Sean

2147
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
How you guys doing tonight

2148
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,824
That dude stone is a bit in

2149
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,896
Inappropriate how to build

2150
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:48,480
Conspiracy about the cover-up of something he has no idea about

2151
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:51,808
Let's go to the level of bulshit workshopping that's so important

2152
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
They had to do this special episode

2153
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
Is entirely point

2154
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,464
Atlas accepted into the audience's heads that no matter what

2155
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,512
Hear this person was on psych meds

2156
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,072
Cuz I made him commit murder and there's a

2157
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,376
The cover-up about whether or not he was on those meds

2158
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,680
If the media says he wasn't on meds

2159
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,520
And they say he was on meds that means you was on even more

2160
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,128
It's all just pointless meeting wasn't dangerous ultimately hurting people who are hurting

2161
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,944
And needs psychological help but are being told that the meds

2162
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Will make them crazy

2163
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:26,624
There's no proof that psych meds had a causal link to these sorts of mass shootings

2164
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,416
Propaganda put out by the Church of Scientology

2165
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:32,256
In that case you might reach that conclusion they were really heavy on

2166
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:36,096
Yeah so this same color as a really stupid phone

2167
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,144
Also on the buyback

2168
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
People be done

2169
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
You're standing on the buyback

2170
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
The gun

2171
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
There's no

2172
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,360
Buyback programs in towns guns

2173
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,896
Go through the roof

2174
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,432
Because there's no

2175
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,248
I just want to make a point of that

2176
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,040
Complete idiot

2177
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,064
When they say no question

2178
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,952
That means that if you have a gun you're not legally allowed to own in a certain State you won't get in trouble for bringing it to a buyback

2179
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,256
It doesn't mean we just accept whatever gone from

2180
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
From anybody

2181
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:11,680
Every authority to run these programs over they choose but typically how they do it is they when a gun is turned in

2182
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:15,264
They run the serial number of it through the database of reported stolen gun

2183
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:20,640
Number matches a stolen gun they can't destroy it without contacting the legal owner

2184
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,920
And getting their permission

2185
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:25,248
In some states you'll also get arrested if you're trying

2186
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,552
To the person who's trying to turn in a stolen

2187
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
1 gun

2188
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:34,720
This guy says he lives in Nebraska where is a class 2A felony to attempt to dispose of a stolen firearm

2189
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,792
So I'm guessing he's just into dumb memes and decided

2190
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,864
Did there people out there stealing everyone's gone so they can sell them to the governor

2191
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,144
Nonsense

2192
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:42,912
That's

2193
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
That no

2194
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:44,704
Clovis Lodge

2195
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,496
Right there because they don't ask questions

2196
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,776
Lindsey Steele done

2197
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Right.

2198
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
So then you steal guns

2199
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
And then you

2200
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,640
Giving them to the buyback

2201
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
Program

2202
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
Cuz I don't ask questions

2203
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,784
And also I would what's stealing guns would be something that Alex

2204
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,904
Thanks can't happen because you would be targeting someone who you know is armed I mean you would think

2205
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:10,304
The possession of a gun stop a person from wanting to steal the gun Cara's here is your problem with the good

2206
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
The guy with the gun

2207
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:15,168
Scenario if the bad guy can steal your guns easily

2208
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
That's an issue

2209
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,984
A good guy can be disarmed

2210
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,544
If they get their gun stolen very quickly

2211
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,360
Who's able to

2212
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:29,760
To steal your guns Just based on a desire to sell them back to the government

2213
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
So stupid

2214
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,600
Going to make sense if you're just like

2215
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,672
It is the kind of thinking that should be

2216
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,464
Isolated two people

2217
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
In a bong

2218
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,512
Circle

2219
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:45,632
City grounds

2220
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:52,032
Extra cash man that's what I meant you can make a little bit

2221
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:58,176
It's like a like

2222
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,712
People coming up with a bad caper

2223
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,528
100%

2224
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,552
Who's at Greaseman

2225
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
Alright

2226
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Thinking about

2227
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,672
A bottle rocket the other day and then

2228
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,976
Just triggered my bike on it again so bad caper

2229
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
That is a bad guy

2230
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,048
God do that

2231
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,352
Future man he's so cool

2232
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,960
Future man

2233
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:25,824
They get another call and this person has worked out a storyline

2234
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,384
About the idea that the shooter was tram

2235
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
Sure

2236
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,456
Mark and Arizona was talking about Mike Adams go ahead

2237
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:37,856
Yeah I'm Mike Adams just posted on naturalnews.com that the kid was a transexual

2238
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
And I think you should

2239
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
Screen

2240
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,744
Yeah that they

2241
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,536
They can you tell 789 year olds

2242
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,840
Maybe that's where he went to elementary school

2243
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:51,168
And he's just going back to where it all began

2244
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,728
And so he was broom there and then setup

2245
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:58,080
Open transition through high school and it drove him crazy stories. His grandma and then went back to

2246
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Start

2247
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
Elaborate on that

2248
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
Azita

2249
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,992
Yeah so that's f***** up

2250
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:09,088
This guy's just created a fun story for himself and narrative Arc

2251
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Based on

2252
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Oaks PA

2253
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,952
Pictures and just what he assumes

2254
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,976
Might have happened

2255
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,792
To somebody in elementary school is f***** up

2256
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,888
This kind of stuff is just not even it's not even unproductive

2257
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,912
It's

2258
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:27,520
It's not even counterproductive it's just I I mean it's

2259
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Astonishing

2260
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,080
Like I really don't understand

2261
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
This person

2262
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,384
I'm like

2263
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,664
Fundamental level

2264
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,736
I listen to somebody say that and I

2265
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,040
Do not know where I belong anymore

2266
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,576
Kind of understand

2267
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,600
What's going on

2268
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,904
Because he's somebody who believe

2269
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:49,792
Leave this b******* it's someone trying to make sense of the information that's being presented to him as

2270
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,608
So can you come up with this

2271
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,656
Explanation in his head

2272
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
And I can understand that

2273
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,264
What I can have a difficult time understanding is

2274
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,800
Feeling like

2275
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,336
There's any Merit

2276
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,640
And saying it out loud

2277
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:09,760
There's any Merit falling into a national radio show the night of the shooting

2278
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,552
To share this

2279
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,344
Theory as if it means anything

2280
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,904
I understand the way that our brains

2281
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:22,304
Works that there's a lot of times you put pieces of information together to try and create a story to help you understand something

2282
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:28,704
Maybe they're necessarily isn't what the pieces of information that he has are bad and wrong so the story

2283
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,496
Please come up with his bad and Rolfe course

2284
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,288
The beat

2285
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,312
Taking action

2286
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:37,664
To share it is weird part I don't understand at all

2287
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,968
Obviously I've spent

2288
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:46,112
Many many a day concocting some sort of narrative to try and make some conspiracy theory makes sense

2289
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:51,744
I understand him coming up with this story a plausible enough sounding

2290
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:56,096
Drawing all of this b******* into a in a more grounded place of like

2291
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:59,168
Are human pesos like a disc

2292
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:03,520
The with the weirdest part of this this guy is tacitly admitting the trans people are

2293
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:09,920
Discriminated against it on over I don't even know that's not fair

2294
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,968
Stop playing the rest of his called but he's

2295
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
He's talking about her about the idea that poachers made him

2296
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,368
Like that

2297
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,744
Jesus Christ

2298
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:31,168
Whose anyway this is a useless use of time for alexandrite

2299
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,704
Laccd

2300
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,240
Useful for him

2301
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,032
So

2302
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
Alex does

2303
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,872
Turn around the idea of false flag

2304
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
The big questions are

2305
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,688
How many

2306
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
False flag

2307
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:44,992
Shelves

2308
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,808
Carry out late they can slap this everyday

2309
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
Attacks

2310
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
Synagogue

2311
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,440
Black churches you name it

2312
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,232
Who are liberals to demonize

2313
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
America

2314
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
Walt the next

2315
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:00,864
And then you can buy tomorrow

2316
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,680
Sunglow f***** up but also they don't catch

2317
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
People doing that everyday

2318
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,984
No pulse

2319
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,544
I I mean

2320
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
It is

2321
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,592
F***** up

2322
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
Currently

2323
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,664
He's trying to demonize

2324
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,688
Groups of people

2325
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:17,248
I'm shocked that he didn't bring up Jessie Smollett

2326
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,016
I am

2327
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,296
I am a little shocked

2328
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,576
Just go to

2329
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
Yep

2330
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,136
Yeah

2331
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,232
So this next call is fun I guess

2332
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,792
Alex Jones

2333
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
Can't get no

2334
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,120
And now you

2335
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,936
But we're all pulling

2336
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:40,288
That's funny because this guy is trying to express solidarity with Alex

2337
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,592
But the way he's doing it actually invalidates

2338
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,152
The giant argument Alex yells about all the time

2339
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,200
According to Alex black people should have

2340
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,552
No problem getting Justice in the courts because there's no such thing as systemic racism

2341
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:54,112
Why this caller sounds like he's trying to push

2342
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
What's trt

2343
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,024
It's hard to believe that Alex doesn't shout him down and correct him the way he would have some left-leaning person were to try to tell him

2344
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,840
Do black people are treated unfairly in the justice system

2345
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,400
It does seem Alex should say

2346
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:12,800
Excuse me you've never had any trouble with the justice system because the entire globalist fear is angled towards

2347
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,848
Making sure you get away with crimes

2348
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:18,944
As much as possible so you can't express solidarity with me

2349
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:24,320
As a white person I'm the only one persecuted by the American justice system sir

2350
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,624
I have strange doesn't respond that way

2351
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,160
That would be more appropriate

2352
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,232
So Ted Nugent shows up

2353
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,560
Bad news

2354
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,424
How you doing Ted when I speak

2355
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
You know Alex

2356
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,216
We spent time

2357
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
Together

2358
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
I I don't

2359
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
Tab Hunter

2360
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
And I

2361
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
Eliminate

2362
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
Presumptions in my life I

2363
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,176
Look in the evidence and I embrace

2364
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
The evidence

2365
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,016
Supposed to

2366
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,296
And I just

2367
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Cannot

2368
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,344
Overstate

2369
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,880
The Heartbreak

2370
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
And I know you know that but I do

2371
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Think we should

2372
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
Pivot off

2373
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,000
Speedpaint

2374
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
Right now

2375
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,072
To allow power

2376
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,096
6 to enter this

2377
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
As long as we possibly

2378
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,168
We can't we get all the answers

2379
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,056
If not if Nugent isn't it to hunches and loves information he should check in with his nutty qanon wife

2380
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:21,152
Also a little late to getting political

2381
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,200
Newton should have come on at the beginning of a

2382
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,480
Michelle

2383
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,808
Something a bunch of fake shittin misidentifying another Mass shooter

2384
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
Also

2385
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:31,136
Ted Nugent is bringing up like we should

2386
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,160
You know

2387
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,952
Feel the pain and all this

2388
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,488
That isn't a part of this

2389
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Broadcast at all

2390
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:41,632
Nope recognizing the pain and really like not pivoting off it is like

2391
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,544
If it wasn't Ted Nugent saying it I don't got probably be okay with the sentiment sure but it has nothing to do with what this is

2392
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,824
Infowars coverage has been

2393
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872
I mean this is in the

2394
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,152
Face of

2395
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,968
The pain front

2396
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,528
Owen said a prayer that I mean

2397
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,296
Did it

2398
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,832
Mention the families

2399
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,880
Yeah a little bit a little bit

2400
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:09,280
I didn't play the entire prayer for you I was a little bit also

2401
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,328
Four Democrats and gun control

2402
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,632
Yeah political

2403
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:17,472
A couple minutes

2404
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,520
30 seconds later

2405
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,056
Ted Nugent gets political

2406
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,848
I'm on with you right now Alex

2407
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
I am not only

2408
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
Dedicated

2409
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,176
Compassion

2410
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,480
Dailymotion about representing

2411
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,248
The heartbeat of

2412
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,296
Broken hearted

2413
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:32,576
Vale Tech

2414
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
You right now Alex

2415
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,928
Human Bean

2416
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
It has ever

2417
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
Liberty

2418
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,816
Is on television right now the man who

2419
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,864
President of United

2420
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
States

2421
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,776
Treasonous man

2422
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,312
Name Jobe

2423
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
Yeah

2424
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
Let's not get political

2425
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,688
I think that like

2426
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,992
Your hours near hours

2427
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,528
Someone

2428
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,832
Murdered Elementary School

2429
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,600
Student

2430
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,136
And

2431
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:10,976
You're going out of your way to say that Joe Biden is one of the worst people was ever

2432
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:17,632
I mean it's it's a little bit much immediately after saying you represent the heart of everyone

2433
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:24,032
Craving brokenhearted Middle America

2434
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,080
Call Biden is a snake

2435
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,896
Also by the way

2436
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,992
Clipper I brought up his wife for being a

2437
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,784
Qanon

2438
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,856
Maybe it seems like a cheap shot but his wife does come

2439
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:44,256
Operator she appears later so there is sort of out of nowhere

2440
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,048
From the right

2441
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,608
So Ted this guy man

2442
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,400
Love evidence of things

2443
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
Either rigorous

2444
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,752
I also love Dinesh D'Souza

2445
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,544
Broward course I'm a huge

2446
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Porter

2447
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,360
Believer

2448
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,152
I bet

2449
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
Scrutinizing

2450
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
I researched

2451
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
All my heart

2452
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
Soul

2453
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,504
Dinesh D'Souza

2454
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,296
As documented evidence

2455
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,576
Documentary 2000

2456
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,136
20 election was

2457
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,464
Dead people by the millions voted that the illegal

2458
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,488
Voted

2459
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
Troydan

2460
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,048
Turn off collection

2461
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
Replacement

2462
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
20 election

2463
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,376
Joe Biden

2464
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,144
Not good

2465
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,168
2020 elect

2466
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:23,936
Illegally

2467
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Close

2468
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:29,568
I've come to realize this I'm into evidence and I do my research

2469
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,616
But isn't something that these people say

2470
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,896
Sincerely even

2471
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,456
It's not meant to

2472
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
To be taken seriously because

2473
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
It's not natural statement of what they

2474
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Practice

2475
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:42,112
As much as it's a statement of how they want to be seen

2476
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:46,976
If a catchphrase basically I'm saying I'm not a racist but

2477
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:53,376
You know some research

2478
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:56,192
Brandon how he's presented to The Wider world of right-wing ship

2479
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,496
He doesn't have any evidence of anything

2480
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:00,544
2000 Buell doesn't prove any of that s***

2481
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,336
This is what I would describe

2482
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,688
Pathetic virtue signaling be done by idiots who Wanna Be

2483
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,712
They're desperate.

2484
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:11,296
Be taken seriously as smart people but they don't want to do anything

2485
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,344
22 Merritt

2486
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,160
Be smart right you have to work at it

2487
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:16,928
Like

2488
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:22,304
Smart you know you don't have to read books or like learn things are like continuously

2489
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,376
Locate yourself ever ending never stopping it's a practice

2490
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,936
Being smart is a practice

2491
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,472
Have

2492
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,008
Being interested in evidence

2493
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,824
And the things that you're talking about being grounded

2494
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,872
It's something that you have to do

2495
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,152
It's not something that you are

2496
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,248
David Nugent and his people like him

2497
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,088
A engage with that is like no this is a characteristic

2498
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Give me

2499
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,136
And that's I think

2500
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,184
Fraudulent but I also think that it's

2501
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,720
It's never meant

2502
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,000
To be really like

2503
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,536
Serious

2504
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:59,936
I mean it is it is nice to have it a Zan inherent characteristic if you are on this

2505
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,704
S*** s***

2506
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,520
Because even when you don't do any research

2507
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,056
You can always be like

2508
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,104
Do you know me I do my research

2509
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:13,504
It's an inherited characteristic that I've established part of my backstory so you got that to rely on even when you're full of s***

2510
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
Right

2511
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
It's annoying

2512
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
It is very annoying

2513
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:21,440
So anyway Ted Nugent really excited because moderate Democrats

2514
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,976
I don't really do

2515
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:28,608
I'm struggling Ted Nugent understands that this is immediately following political

2516
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
But Myra Democrats

2517
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:34,752
I don't know what moderate Democrats are hanging out with

2518
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,032
Moderate Democrat

2519
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,056
Starting to realize the

2520
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
The Democrats are

2521
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,128
I'm telling you that this

2522
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,944
The heretofore so-called

2523
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
Moderate

2524
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:48,064
They're finally getting their head out of their ass they're going wait a minute

2525
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,600
If you don't have

2526
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,648
Secure borders you're not even

2527
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,232
When you facilitate the invasion

2528
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:59,584
Fentanyl and methamphetamine when you reward coyotes

2529
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Traffic

2530
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Children First

2531
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,168
And profit

2532
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,728
When You See It Wide Open

2533
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,544
If those departed had a hope for a

2534
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,080
Democrat lifestyle

2535
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,616
They're finally going my God

2536
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:13,664
Current Democrat

2537
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,456
United States of America

2538
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,992
They are pure

2539
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,784
They are trees

2540
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,320
Did every Acworth

2541
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:23,392
Indeed

2542
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,184
Janice all the time as always

2543
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Liberal friends

2544
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,488
They're all in woken up

2545
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,768
They're all talking about

2546
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,560
Donald Trump

2547
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
And

2548
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,144
So no matter how many frogs live oak Stave.

2549
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,752
The dishes a suicide pact apart

2550
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
Is big news

2551
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,592
Wow I would become pills

2552
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,128
Can't believe Alex

2553
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,968
His wife's affluent tennis partner friends what eventually turned

2554
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:52,064
Against populist ideology is like

2555
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,600
So crazy just like

2556
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:58,976
These these characters that don't exist on the show but

2557
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,000
Exist as

2558
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,792
Figments of Alex's imagination

2559
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,584
I really do enjoy tracking down

2560
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:09,984
Whenever Alex's wife's tennis Partners come off it comes from them

2561
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,776
There's a bit like a Greek chorus

2562
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,080
See you there there there in the background

2563
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:18,688
And they contribute when necessary apparently I wasn't using them to do exit polling

2564
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:22,016
Repulsive the country by way of

2565
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,808
Tennis partners

2566
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:27,648
Ted Nugent as something to promote

2567
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,672
But he's doing it

2568
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,464
A way that I would describe his dishonor

2569
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,000
Wenoka

2570
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,280
Art

2571
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,608
We have

2572
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
The weather

2573
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936
Chastised

2574
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,472
Weed

2575
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,240
We've got a

2576
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,520
Hear what you have to

2577
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,544

You've got to get everybody in your life

To both those core values

2581
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,296

America

2593
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,472
Particularly here in

2594
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,240
Text

2595
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,776
Oh man I remember when

2596
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:18,848
Guys were saying Democrats doing like get-out-the-vote effort

2597
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,872
Registration

2598
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:22,944
They're just trying to steal an election by signing up fake people

2599
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:25,760
Dad is yelling about getting people registered

2600
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
Seems fishy

2601
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,344
I went Soccer Nation

2602
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,904
Subscription website Ted runs where there's some dumb

2603
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,696
Content like blogs and stuff

2604
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:36,000
But it's mostly just about him making money

2605
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:41,376
He also brings together show their retail to co-host

2606
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,400
The dump

2607
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:48,288
I guess things are dried up since he doesn't have those TV shows anymore and his music sucks so you got to do what you got to do

2608
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,944
On the site also you can buy raffle tickets to go hunting with Ted or if you like you can try to win the chance to hunt a bear

2609
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,968
Baron Idaho

2610
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:56,992
Great stuff

2611
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
What are there past

2612
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:01,600
Dream hunts was go I go shooting with

2613
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,136
Trump's son

2614
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:08,768
There's a tell hear that Ted is obscuring and that's it there's another website called

2615
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:11,584
Hunt the vote which is where the whole registration

2616
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,376
Hunter nation is

2617
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,168
Website where there's a bunch of

2618
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
Was dumb bulshit

2619
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
30 cells on it

2620
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:19,008
If you were actually focused on the registration

2621
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Some stuff as opposed

2622
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,568
The advertising is on garbage

2623
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,336
He promote

2624
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:24,128
The other side

2625
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,480
This is why I felt so good

2626
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,016
You know even if it was

2627
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,552
About promoting

2628
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,320
Voting

2629
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,136
You know that's still f***** up on the the night

2630
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:41,536
That is a lie about promoting yourself it's f***** up

2631
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,840
I understand that but he wants to get

2632
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Profitable

2633
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
Yes

2634
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,680
So Alex

2635
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,960
Is trying

2636
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,984
Desperately

2637
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
To get tabs

2638
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,544
To say that bad s***

2639
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,568
Sure

2640
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:57,664
Yeah this clip is really funny because I was just trying

2641
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,480
Cat doesn't play ball Adam and Alex has to like

2642
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,528
Put his tail between his legs and salt

2643
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:07,392
I believe this is a real psychopath I believe the shooting happen

2644
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,952
The question is

2645
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,024
Though it's little weird

2646
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,304
That we're right outside

2647
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,584
Midterms

2648
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,352
Harden's

2649
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,656
68 days out

2650
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,960
And magically this is all happening

2651
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,240
What do you

2652
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,264
Respect in the Bible

2653
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,800
The Deep state has

2654
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,616
As it comes out the Russia gate

2655
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:30,432
And all everything else they do

2656
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,712
Do blows up

2657
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:34,784
Gut-level as an American as a patriot

2658
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832

What do you expect them to pull neck

2664
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
Well

2665
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,888

Current governor

2695
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,504
The cruelty

2696
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,528
Honesty

2697
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
Violation

2698
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,088
Reconstitute

2699
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:45,696
I believe that it's going to be a win-win I'm an eternal optimist

2700
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,232
And I have great hope

2701
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,768
People are waking up and

2702
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
We are going to

2703
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,864
Squeezing this way that is now headed

2704
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,680
Syllable in the White House

2705
01:56:56,448 --> 01:57:01,824
Ted Nugent I totally agree with the old Shores got some questions my question is

2706
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,128
Totally agree with you

2707
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:10,528
The moment you are off this phone call I'm going to claim that there will be non-stop mass shootings from now until the end of the midterm

2708
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,088
God dammit dare you say that there is

2709
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,880
Positive things coming

2710
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:17,696
Non-stop shooting from now until the end of the midterms

2711
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:18,976
Talking Ted

2712
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:23,072
Ruining my pocket neighbor let's go camping shut up

2713
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,704
Gets involved in a proceeding

2714
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,264
And she probably hasn't gotten one of the memos that Alex

2715
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
Just put out

2716
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:35,360
She manages just as smart as you are what was her view on time

2717
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,664
Hey Alex

2718
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,968
Right here

2719
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,504
I agree with Ted

2720
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,528
And you know

2721
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,112
It's a shame but what's going on I don't know how anybody think

2722
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,136
Is that if we don't

2723
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,160
Change the way that

2724
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:48,928
We voted

2725
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,696
In the past

2726
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,464
Why are things

2727
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,232
Going to be any different

2728
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,792
Can't fix these voting

2729
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,072
I'm I'm

2730
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,120
I'm scared of what's going to happen

2731
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:03,520
No the voting machines were red herring no no no no

2732
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,336
Machines were distraction by the global is so weird

2733
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:12,736
Recent movie that your husband is promoting

2734
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,600
Where is there voting machines in that one who cares

2735
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,904
It's mostly about the mules of course

2736
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:24,256
Sharmaine brings up a hanging out with

2737
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:27,584
Trump sure and that's fun to think about

2738
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,424
But Alex is really excited you want some hot gossip

2739
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,472
When we were with pressure

2740
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,800
Weekend or two things that he said to Adele

2741
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,104
He said I think it's going to get pretty dark

2742
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,896
Before it gets better

2743
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
Before it gets

2744
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:42,944
Light

2745
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
And that

2746
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,736
This had to happen

2747
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,272
And so that people would weigh

2748
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:47,040
Makeup

2749
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,112
Wow so Trump said that that's huge

2750
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,672
Yeah he admitted

2751
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,208
Great time with the Press

2752
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
Great man

2753
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
He's not perfect

2754
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
But compared to the regular

2755
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,048
The politician

2756
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
She's almost like

2757
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,584
Michael

2758
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,912
No I agree we'll spend a few minutes on that let you beautiful people go

2759
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
At least tell me what about you

2760
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:05,984
Lamar

2761
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:12,640
Strange sycophantic that still kind of Israel even though he's trying to pretend that he's like

2762
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,432
Not moved on

2763
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,272
They still very much as I'd strfkr

2764
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,832
So the nugents golf

2765
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,392
And if it's back to business right

2766
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,672
I want have some thoughts

2767
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,464
About who could and could not own

2768
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,232
Dunce

2769
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,512
In the early American his

2770
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:35,424
I don't I don't want to live in a war zone I want to live in a society where every I feel like I have to carry a gun around

2771
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:39,264
We are in a war zone with all these other words for

2772
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,080
I'll tell you that damn true I never going to be a Slave

2773
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,664
The second amendment was written

2774
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,968
That'd mean everybody could own a gun

2775
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:54,112
Let's see why don't you finish that statement who couldn't own a gun in 1776 who was that

2776
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Waves

2777
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,160
That's what it was

2778
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:56,928
Slave

2779
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,720
Couldn't own a gun in 1770

2780
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,000
So they just want to make you a Slave

2781
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:06,400
You're not supposed to care that much about slavery was not a bad thing

2782
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,704
Exactly right

2783
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,008
So you should also probably learn a little bit more about history

2784
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,288
Slaves

2785
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:16,128
Couldn't own a gun in the early days of America but you know who else couldn't

2786
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,408
All non-white people

2787
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:20,992
Regardless of whether or not they were enslaved like Native Americans

2788
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,784
Also you be really hard press

2789
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,320
Certified women who own guns

2790
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:29,440
Although they could be culturally was

2791
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,720
Very acceptable

2792
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,024
Also anyone who didn't

2793
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,584
Swear an oath of loyalty to the new country

2794
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
Couldn't

2795
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,936
And prior to the founding of the country

2796
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:43,520
The colonies of Maryland and Virginia specifically disarmed Catholics

2797
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:46,336
And I'm Pennsylvania joined in on that later

2798
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:52,736
The early Americans targeted populations that they felt were likely to rebel against

2799
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:59,136
It's remarkable really like Alex fetishizes the founding fathers and yet they did exactly the thing is constantly yelling weather global

2800
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:01,696
Doing and then the globalist never actually do the thing

2801
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,512
Yeah yeah so so what they were realized

2802
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:07,328
I think Ryan is they didn't like the way King George was oppressing them

2803
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:12,960
They overslept and then they looked at their own behavior towards other people

2804
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,264
They have a legitimate grievance against us

2805
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,056
We could do things better

2806
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,080
Or

2807
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:21,408
I'll tell you this that King George guy knew what he was talking about

2808
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:24,736
During like the colonial times

2809
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:27,552
A lot of that stuff like this arm and Catholics and what have you

2810
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:29,088
But an eight

2811
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:34,976
1878 New Hampshire make it a law that would disarm and imprison any Tramp that was quote

2812
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:38,304
Found carrying any firearm or other dangerous weapon

2813
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,352
Tramps would lose their guns

2814
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:46,752
If all they did was quote threaten to do any injury to any person or to the real or personal estate of another

2815
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:51,360
It was tough for cramps but I didn't leave

2816
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,384
Against ramp

2817
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:59,552
Anyways the picture of who was in wasn't allowed to be armed in the early history of our country isn't as cut-and-dry as on W B

2818
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
That makes sense

2819
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
Given that

2820
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
I'm sure most

2821
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,392
The stuff that he knows comes

2822
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:05,184
Is from memes listening to Alex makes

2823
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,536
Things up I mean isn't he supposed to even be like no slaves could own guns

2824
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:15,936
Better whatever it is supposed to believe that all the rights apply equally even if you're a Slave

2825
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:20,288
Because you choose to be a slave or something along those when I bet they wouldn't want to parse that out

2826
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,592
Yep yep

2827
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
They go back to call

2828
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,200
This car has some really good advice

2829
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:27,968
But it's also

2830
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,992
Too late

2831
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,784
Yeah I'm first of all Nina

2832
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,880
Sick to my stomach feel like everybody else in

2833
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,696
You can't talk that so

2834
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:41,792
I'm not going to go there go to Hunter Nation.

2835
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:46,656
Unfold in this you know we know how things change over the neck

2836
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:53,056
Do they show any conclusions Alex like you have entire time

2837
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:57,664
Bad idea to speculate this close to it so little information Alex

2838
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:02,016
Don't do the show you're the middle of doing a

2839
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:04,576
Do the things you're doing

2840
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,952
It's a f*****-up perspectives on

2841
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,256
Alex decides to sign off on that way

2842
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,792
Hey

2843
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:17,888
I've been listening to show for about 2 years. I really appreciate the work

2844
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,960
Equipment

2845
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:21,728
Xscape

2846
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,312
Brainwashing through the media

2847
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,896
In the Pharma companies get ahold of them

2848
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,688
And whack them out of their minds with

2849
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,456
With the drug

2850
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,248
We need to take the kids out

2851
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,552
Always thinking about Jesus

2852
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
Because he's coming back very

2853
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:40,416
Well I totally hear that statement on

2854
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:46,816
Check that check so take your kids out of the schools but Jesus is coming back soon Alex like hell yeah hell yeah

2855
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:50,144
Also take the kids out of the schools and also on teachers

2856
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:53,984
I don't know I don't know what's going on anymore

2857
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,800
And you should try and teach your children

2858
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,336
Geometry

2859
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:04,224
By yourself I guess it kind of makes some sense in his much as like let's arm the teachers but everyone's home

2860
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:09,856
School so it's all the parents are I guess that's the work around here

2861
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,648
Do all women

2862
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,416
Not accept

2863
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
Anybody on the last

2864
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:16,512
Pretending that they care about the shooter

2865
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:18,304
That's nice

2866
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,840
This is something that frustrates

2867
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:20,864
Me so much about the

2868
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,216
They want to sit here and virtue signal and have their

2869
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:25,984
The crocodile

2870
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:27,264
There's any time they can

2871
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,032
Can use

2872
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:28,800
A tragedy

2873
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,336
For their political

2874
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,104
Advantage

2875
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,384
I don't want to

2876
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:35,456
I don't want to hear about a Democrat upset about

2877
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,736
The children dead

2878
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:38,528
The Uvalde shooting because

2879
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:42,880
You celebrate 60 million dead babies aborted in this

2880
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
You literally go out in

2881
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:44,928
And celebrate

2882
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,488
Your specials on TV you do parade

2883
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,768
You launch confetti

2884
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:49,792
You paint your face

2885
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,352
You celebrate abortion you literally

2886
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:56,448
Celebrating baby murder and they say kill that bastard

2887
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,752
Expect me

2888
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:01,824
Just sit here and have my emotional heartstrings tugged on by the

2889
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:05,664
Do you have a conscience

2890
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,200
They manipulate your conscience

2891
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:07,968
Hey dick

2892
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,760
Don't

2893
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,832
Have an emotional reaction to what other people

2894
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
Are saying

2895
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:16,672
You have an emotional reaction to the events

2896
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,696
Itself

2897
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,000
Yeah it is

2898
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,792
I don't know why you take

2899
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,584
Any kind of

2900
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,608
Like look

2901
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,632
I have a lot of thoughts

2902
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:27,168
About Alex's response

2903
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
22

2904
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:33,056
I have a lot of feelings about that in terms of this episode

2905
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,848
Who is completely distinct

2906
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,384
From my actual feelings

2907
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,408
About the shooting

2908
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:40,480
And my emotional response

2909
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,248
And

2910
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,528
Processing of it

2911
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
Yeah

2912
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,832
Does not feel

2913
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,672
From the way they're doing and how they're engaging with this

2914
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,464
That there is much of a difference

2915
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,256
Between the response to the shooting

2916
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,792
And their response to

2917
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:55,328
What liberals

2918
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,352
Arguing

2919
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
Are you did

2920
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,168
Just say why are you trying to make me

2921
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
We care about this

2922
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:06,592
It feels that way a little bit because you support abortion shouldn't you shouldn't be making me care about this

2923
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
Sunday I mean

2924
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,384
You know

2925
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,920
What it is is name

2926
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:10,944
Pants

2927
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,968
Believe

2928
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,992
That there is a

2929
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:15,040
Different what you know like cuz they

2930
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,832
Politicized they do all of this stuff

2931
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,880
So they can't believe that there's a way not

2932
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,184
They know that it

2933
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,512
Would be better to not do that they don't believe that anybody isn't as

2934
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,792
Craven

2935
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:32,192
And they have to because if you recognize that other people are not as craving as you then you can't really justify your craving Behavior

2936
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,776
So in this makes clip of the worm turns

2937
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,432
Some information comes Alex's attentions and everything everything is different

2938
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:45,248
Flipped upside down

2939
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,296
That the photos going around the internet of the

2940
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,600
Is the reported shooter

2941
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:53,696
Andy to go pawn shop mini or posting photos of a young male in women's clothing

2942
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:56,000
Play Migos Uvalde Texas mass shooter

2943
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:59,072
He's a round firm and verify please stop sharing because

2944
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:00,352
The event they are

2945
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,656
Art Ramos

2946
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,448
Tommy someone who had nothing to do with it

2947
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,336
The images that they're talkin about or not

2948
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,872
Sharing there's

2949
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:12,896
Images out there

2950
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Locklear

2951
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,200
Trans man waving

2952
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,480
Flags and stuff we have

2953
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
I've been sharing those

2954
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,016
I believe though

2955
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:19,296
You talked about

2956
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,320
We've been sharing you

2957
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,600
On the

2958
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:25,952
Could be us

2959
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:34,400
Alex is making a clarification based on Andino posting that this trans individualism

2960
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:37,728
Can probably the shooting after he's already spent pretty much his entire show reporting

2961
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,008
The shooters

2962
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:44,384
And to be clear the picture they've been talking about this whole show is the one that was the 4chan hoax

2963
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,688
You can tell by how preoccupied Alex has been about

2964
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
Stockings in skirt

2965
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,784
The picture that the actual shooter posted to his imps

2966
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,320
Instagram includes him wearing

2967
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:57,952
This is Alex realizing in real time that he's done the same thing that he did with the Parkland shooting

2968
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,976
Sing all over again

2969
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:05,632
He's taking some dumb shity song 4chan and he's participated in and greatly Amplified the defamatory claims that it innocent

2970
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,168
A sun is a mass murderer

2971
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:12,544
All it takes is a tweet from Andino to get Alex to start covering his ass but if you pay attention

2972
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:13,568
You'll see the ant

2973
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,848
Baby posted that tweet at

2974
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,384
6:29 p.m.

2975
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,456
Over half an hour before Alex got on air for this special report

2976
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,784
I have no idea if what Alex did this x x

2977
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,344
Symbol in any way but it's called splash of water to

2978
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,136
To the face that brings into sharp Focus

2979
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:32,512
Alex's incapable of or unwilling to learn any lessons when it comes to being responsible in his reporting

2980
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:38,912
His priority is pushing his extreme right-wing politics and he does not give a s*** if he hurts people in service of making engaging

2981
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,936
Sensationalized

2982
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,216
And bigoted content

2983
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,008
Don't forget that

2984
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,032
Within the first

2985
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:46,848
Minute of being on air Alex reported that the shooter was Tran

2986
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:50,944
Based on a picture that he'd come across and sent to his staff which Alex specific

2987
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:54,272
Berkeley said we're people in like a person in a dress

2988
02:08:55,040 --> 02:09:00,416
This is not the Instagram picture of the actual shooter the whole shows content has been based on 4chan hoax

2989
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:02,976
I did this is just a sad attempt to cover some ass

2990
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:03,744
And I think

2991
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,560
That the way that Owen jumps in and is like

2992
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:09,888
Instagram picture that reveals

2993
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:11,936
Knowledge of wellheads.

2994
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:16,544
That to me is so telling a lie.

2995
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,384
Oh oh way we have to come up with an explanation for why what we did was

2996
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:23,712
The other thing that andino's Queen is telling people not to do

2997
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:24,992
Yep it's pathetic

2998
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,016
It takes

2999
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,040
Andino

3000
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,856
To realize what they're doing

3001
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
Is f*****

3002
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
Like

3003
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,672
It's sad but I guess

3004
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:35,744
If the message gets across

3005
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,512
Sure

3006
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,280
Whatever

3007
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,304
Yeah that's

3008
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:43,680
That's so unreal back himself up more with like a man

3009
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:45,472
Breaking news breaking story Woody

3010
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,240
You going to do

3011
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:48,544
Okay I was just alive breaking news event

3012
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:50,592
Information

3013
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:52,128
Not sure if

3014
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,432
Salvador is

3015
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,200
The

3016
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
Well over the next

3017
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Judaism

3018
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,488
Intel as it doesn't roll as they roll it out

3019
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,328
Shooting all over again

3020
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:15,168
What exactly is on wanting to know about the Las Vegas shooting

3021
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:21,568
What was that because he stopped caring about it and has anything about the story a few years doesn't mean that everybody

3022
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:23,360
Else just as pretending it didn't exist

3023
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,408
Except Steve pieczenik he's definitely worth

3024
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
Or happened at all

3025
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:34,112
In August 2018 the Las Vegas Metro Police Department released a 187 page report covering the investor

3026
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:35,136
Gage middle shooting

3027
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:37,696
So curious about anything you should go ahead and read that

3028
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:43,328
The FBI didn't investigation as well and determined that they couldn't nail down a specific motive which is

3029
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,096
Frustrating

3030
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
But it's not proof of any kind of

3031
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
The cover-up

3032
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:51,008
We heard in the Daniels deposition about how the audience loses interest

3033
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,800
Austin stories that are a few days old

3034
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:55,872
And that they have to tailor their coverage to accommodate that

3035
02:10:56,384 --> 02:11:01,248
In order to chase viewers and keep the supplement selling Infowars moved on from caring about that story

3036
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:03,040
And what I want is doing here is

3037
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:07,648
He's trying to blame everyone else for their own shallowness and laziness and covering stories

3038
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,720
But yeah you lost the interest in covering this

3039
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,768
Because it wasn't moving the needle

3040
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:14,304
And now you're pretending that

3041
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:15,584
They just stopped

3042
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,120
Investigating it or covering

3043
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:19,424
What are you

3044
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:23,520
Admitting is that he does not do any research at all A's

3045
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:24,544
He's only spoon

3046
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,312
Fed

3047
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:27,104
What it is he gets

3048
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:29,920
You know like he doesn't actually go

3049
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,968
Well I mean in I mean totally like

3050
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:35,296
They don't go looking for things it's brought to them

3051
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,952
You know they don't go they don't go looking for I have a question that I want the answer to I'll go look divine

3052
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:45,280
It's either the answer is already is either brought to them

3053
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:47,072
Or they don't they don't find it

3054
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:50,656
Not really in the info

3055
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,216
So

3056
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,496
This guy wants to pray

3057
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:56,800
So we have two players on the show

3058
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,360
Keep this in just as a kind of

3059
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:00,128
Contrast

3060
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:02,944
Cuz I think this is a pretty decent prayer okay

3061
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,320
Are you there

3062
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,856
I sure am brother welcome

3063
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,440
Thank you it's honor to be with you tonight

3064
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:15,232
I just wanted to offer

3065
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,536
People in Uvalde

3066
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,072
Bored

3067
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:19,840
We ask that

3068
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:21,376
Cover the fam

3069
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
These precious children

3070
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:24,448
In your grace

3071
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,240
And

3072
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,288
Give the family

3073
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:33,152
Accept what has happened

3074
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,712
It's normal.

3075
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,736
They're going to be upset

3076
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,320
There's nothing we can say

3077
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,624
Comfort Inn

3078
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,672
But the Lord can do

3079
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:45,696
And he will

3080
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,232
We ask this

3081
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,024
Your name

3082
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
The name of Jesus

3083
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,328
Jesus Christ Our Savior

3084
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:52,864
And holy spirit

3085
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:54,912
Amen

3086
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:57,472
Diorite

3087
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:01,824
Just running around

3088
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:06,432
Oz responses s*** but the reason that I wanted to play it was

3089
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:07,200
Because

3090
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:10,016
I want to stress

3091
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:10,784
Like

3092
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,088
People pray on Infowars

3093
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,392
I'm not opposed to pray

3094
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,696
I just think that they use

3095
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:19,232
Usually do it in a really

3096
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:20,512
F*****-up way

3097
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:25,120
That is generally self-serving and maybe pushing an agenda

3098
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:30,240
I think that's what this color is doing is expressing a pain and a wish to

3099
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:34,336
Express solidarity desire for

3100
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:37,152
God's grace to help

3101
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:38,176
The parents right

3102
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:41,504
And I don't think there's anything wrong with it I think it's a little bit weird

3103
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:48,160
How to show 2% itself as a new show at and for people to be praying all over it

3104
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,208
It's it's sort of the difference of his style

3105
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,488
Right right right

3106
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:54,816
I just we make fun of a lot of the year

3107
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:57,632
And people end up praying on Alex's show that's right

3108
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:02,240
But I just want to be clear that there are instances every now and again

3109
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,520
Maybe rare

3110
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:06,336
Where somebody comes

3111
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,872
Somber

3112
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:09,920
I know and I respect

3113
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,688
That I just

3114
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,712
Know that

3115
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:18,368
Proves they don't actually believe in or give a s*** about their religion whatsoever bring to the table

3116
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:20,672
You know what the Bible is bringing to the table and he doesn't

3117
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,464
Well damn

3118
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,000
You're jumping to

3119
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
But look

3120
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,304
Here's that here's the deal

3121
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,864
I just want to put these

3122
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:29,632
Juxtaposition

3123
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:31,168
Owens prayer

3124
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:32,192
The scholars prayer

3125
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:34,496
There's a world of difference between them

3126
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:36,800
And I feel like one of the reasons is B

3127
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:37,568
Because

3128
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:39,104
Does an opportunistic Miss

3129
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:41,920
And there is a sincerity

3130
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:42,688
I'm feeling

3131
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
100%

3132
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:46,272
Is the

3133
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,088
The relevant difference

3134
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,112
I agree

3135
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:53,696
Alex midici Mandino's tweet

3136
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,768
The tone of this is entirely different lb

3137
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:00,352
Salvador Ramos is the real shooter

3138
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:01,888
Who knows if any of the

3139
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,680
Who knows of these photos

3140
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,728
Who knows who the guy in the skirts real

3141
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,776
Who knows if any of this is

3142
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:09,568
Because the media lies

3143
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,336
So much

3144
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:11,360
We have a right

3145
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:13,152
To say we don't believe what we're hearing

3146
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:15,712
Such a strange shift in tone

3147
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:18,272
How much is clearly worried that buddy

3148
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:24,672
Been saying this whole show the looks bad now that it's become clear that he was identifying the wrong person as the shooter

3149
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:30,816
All this show has been like we got pictures the reported shooter and then straight demonizing Tran

3150
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:33,376
People all the sudden Alex doesn't know if

3151
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,400
Anything is real

3152
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:39,008
He's gone from a sensational is bigoted propagandist perpetuating 4chan hoax

3153
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:41,824
I'm so skeptical they can't even prove that the person

3154
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,616
Sitting next to them is real

3155
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
Who's the FedEx.

3156
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:48,224
I mean he's retreated into a world of like

3157
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,016
You have to prove everything

3158
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,552
It's what he did in the deposition

3159
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:58,208
You know he retreated back the moment he got the the moment he had to confront reality

3160
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:00,000
And he cannot get away with

3161
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,816
He has to not do what he's about to

3162
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,352
Right

3163
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,888
He immediately backed up and he's like

3164
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:07,424
Listen I mean I don't know if it's

3165
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,472
I'm not saying that I know it's

3166
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:15,104
I said to go old saying is that there were questions it sometimes two people today that I don't know if it's this guy or that guy

3167
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:17,408
You might as well be doing is admitting guilt

3168
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:22,528
Before we get anywhere we have to try and prove that existence

3169
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,808
It's something that everyone

3170
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:28,672
Create the universe

3171
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,696
Basically

3172
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:31,488
Another caller

3173
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
Glaring

3174
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:37,376
The difference in bananas

3175
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:38,912
And there's a real

3176
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:41,984
So they take another call and this guy has a

3177
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,264
Fun idea

3178
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,800
That it's never going to happen

3179
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,848
Alex I finally get

3180
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:48,128
Talk to you finally in

3181
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:48,896
41

3182
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:49,920
I want to let you know

3183
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:50,944
You

3184
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,480
Owen and Harry

3185
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,272
Need to go on Joe Rogan

3186
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,040
Podcast

3187
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,064
Quit this

3188
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,088
Send it to him

3189
02:16:58,624 --> 02:16:59,136
Bellevue

3190
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,416
People want you guys

3191
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,440
All three of you

3192
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:06,048
I know he want me on Joe Rogan's podcast

3193
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:06,816
Friends Ojo

3194
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,120
Pressure

3195
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,144
Obviously

3196
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,448
The highest ratings

3197
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:14,496
Would be great

3198
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
Kind of

3199
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:19,616
Begging the question there but yes I appreciate it

3200
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:23,712
I'm not getting back on that show maybe for a long time and

3201
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:25,504
Yes

3202
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,832
Just enough patience for me he does not want my lackeys

3203
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:35,232
Oh no no no no no no this is something they call hers

3204
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,536
Should really ask

3205
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:38,816
Themselves

3206
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:39,840
Okay yeah

3207
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:41,888
Joe is

3208
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:42,912
Fine

3209
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:44,192
A couple times

3210
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,472
Having Alex on

3211
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:48,800
AMC has a lot of f*****-up weirdos come on

3212
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
Weirdly

3213
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:51,104
He does not

3214
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,664
Invite on people who are like

3215
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:56,224
A bunch of Alex's

3216
02:17:56,480 --> 02:18:00,064
Yeah it is is Wack Pack for a lack of a better term

3217
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,600
Where's dr. marble

3218
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:08,512
I don't know how they're going on Joe Rogan that's for sure

3219
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:11,840
Skousen

3220
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:13,120
Not going to

3221
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:17,984
Broken that is unlikely

3222
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,264
From having Rogers

3223
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,056
You're still. Is vodka

3224
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:22,336
Although I think I would be

3225
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:28,736
That would be interested that would actually probably be the first time I listen to a Rogan episode is orbit

3226
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,040
That like you know obviously rubbing his

3227
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:31,808
Probably

3228
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:38,208
Real interested in talking to

3229
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:38,976
Really faint

3230
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,512
Yeah it would make sense

3231
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,560
I think Mike Lindell could go

3232
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:47,168
Yeah yeah yeah whatever Logan needs a little spending money

3233
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:53,824
That hundred million goes away real quick you know do you know what your spending I don't know if it goes with that quick

3234
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:56,896
I don't know I mean like look I don't have a hundred million dollars

3235
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:57,920
And

3236
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:01,248
Mike Liddell couldn't pay to get on this podcast

3237
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,784
So that's fair

3238
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:08,416
So I mean like Alex is talking about like this idea of

3239
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,184
Like

3240
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:14,304
I'm not going to be on Rogan

3241
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:17,632
Because he doesn't have access to the

3242
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,400
Top

3243
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:20,704
Tear

3244
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,472
Annie Potts

3245
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,520
Smelly

3246
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:27,872
When you see video that Harrison made being pushed on Tucker Carlson

3247
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:34,016
You have to pretend that it's not from an Infowars

3248
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:35,040
Never heard

3249
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:36,576
So Alex

3250
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:38,624
We always talked about having the globalist

3251
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,392
Playbook

3252
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:42,208
In a way that is like I know what they're going to do

3253
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:44,256
He talks a little bit more about this

3254
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:46,560
I honestly think that the way he's describing this here

3255
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,840
Is meaning

3256
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:50,400
If they don't have totally

3257
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:51,936
Controlled regulation

3258
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:53,728
Is coming up for the midterms are going to have to do

3259
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:54,496
Do something

3260
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:57,056
To either curtail people from voting or

3261
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:59,104
It just not even have an election

3262
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,384
Crazy

3263
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,152
Cheap

3264
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:03,200
The globalist are predictable in that

3265
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,736
We know they have the

3266
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,016
These plans up their sleeves

3267
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:07,040
How they're going to

3268
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:11,904
Decide what they want to reach I can make

3269
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,000
Patriots are known to do

3270
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:18,816
Did the other side Playbook you don't know when they're going to play

3271
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,120
Do we have the Playbook

3272
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,656
We just don't know what play there

3273
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:23,680
That means nothing

3274
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:25,216
We don't have nothing

3275
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:25,984
We have

3276
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,520
Okay so when I watch

3277
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:30,336
Let's say we were playing a football game right now

3278
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:34,944
Tape 45-minute football game or whatever it is

3279
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:38,528
Right so I know all the other teams play

3280
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:45,440
Because I've watched them play them over and over and over again that means that I know exactly what they're going to do

3281
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:46,976
We will win the game every time right

3282
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:50,560
I mean like obviously though

3283
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:51,840
That you have of knowing

3284
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:53,120
Games plays is like

3285
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:57,728
The way they line up a lineup will give you some indication of what

3286
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:00,032
Play my TV

3287
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:00,800
Two things yes

3288
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:01,568
Alex

3289
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:05,664
Engages with a globalist like that but he's wrong every f****** time

3290
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,432
Right

3291
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:11,296
Well I mean it's like if Alex was the coach of the Bangles

3292
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,832
And I was the coach of the Patriots

3293
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,368
And I had the Bangles

3294
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,392
Playbook

3295
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:17,440
And Alex had the Playbook

3296
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,208
For like

3297
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,512
I don't know the Cincinnati Reds

3298
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:22,560
You know wrong sport

3299
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:23,584
You know it's true

3300
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:31,520
Catch the ball how do I throw a curveball

3301
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:35,872
Did the thing that he's describing is essentially like if I were to boil this out until like

3302
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:36,896
More realist

3303
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:37,920
Stick language it's

3304
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:40,736
I've come up with a bunch of stuff that icons

3305
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,784
Stanley say the globalist are going to do

3306
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,344
And I don't know when they're going to do these things

3307
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,624
If they're going to do them

3308
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:50,976
But these are all the things that I've decided by enemies are capable of

3309
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,024
It's meaningless.

3310
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:56,096
You might as well have a whiteboard and just write down random

3311
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:02,496
Thoughts that he has a things that might be bad and then just write him up there and then if he doesn't like it

3312
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:05,056
The Playbook

3313
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:06,336
So bad news

3314
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:07,616
Don't know

3315
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,640
It's the summer of Rage

3316
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:11,456
There's already

3317
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,736
It's the liberal summer of rain

3318
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:15,296
Okay so the liberal of Summer of rage is

3319
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,832
Upon us they do this

3320
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:20,928
Every election cycle 2020 we saw them burn half of America down to the ground

3321
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:23,488
2000ad and everything

3322
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,280
Betrayal the Democrats summer of Rage

3323
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:31,680
So if you can't midterm every other summer is a summer of Ray every other summer is assembly of rage and it's always

3324
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,704
Only the liberal

3325
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:35,520
And the other summers are

3326
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:37,056
Summers of

3327
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:41,408
Summers of

3328
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:47,808
You know it's like it's that kind of thing when the electioneer is that on the off

3329
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:48,576
Igear

3330
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:51,648
It's the summer of reflection and

3331
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:52,416
King stock

3332
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:56,768
What happened during the raid

3333
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:59,328
Immediately followed by the fall of malaise

3334
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:02,400
Yep so we won't last clip here and

3335
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:04,448
I mean if I were to put a button on

3336
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:05,472
This whole

3337
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,240
Show

3338
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,776
It's been meaningless

3339
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:11,872
Yeah but yeah I hear Alex explains why he did the the show

3340
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,432
Owen great job I want to say great job

3341
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:16,992
The crew we got to all those calls thing in Ventura

3342
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,808
Would you like 20 calls at Ted Nugent on

3343
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:22,624
Came in because those dead children important

3344
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:24,672
And people trying to capitalize

3345
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,440
On their murder

3346
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:26,720
Are bad people

3347
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:32,096
So we had to come in because we do by going to show up tonight to capitalize all information show

3348
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,120
Conservatives

3349
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:34,656
We as Christians

3350
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:37,216
We have populist we approach humans

3351
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,752
Don't show up

3352
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:40,288
When the enemy shows up

3353
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:41,312
We've given them a few

3354
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,592

02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:44,128

The deepest crystalline on a global trying to keep from you in

3371
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:17,664
Such a game-changer look into it

3372
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:20,992
It's 40% off of Albrecht 1225 percentile by itself

3373
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,016
I got no roots

3374

Down the Galaxy

3375
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:26,368
Trying to profit off those are bad people

3376
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:29,440
People who were trying to be opportunistic and profit off of

3377
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,512
Baby boy

3378
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:38,912
Christian's really love showing up after all those children and murdered to go try and make sure other children get murdered later

3379
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,448
I had Ted Nugent wasn't crying

3380
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:42,240
And I will direct people to his son

3381
02:24:42,496 --> 02:24:45,568
Description website

3382
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,848
This type of thing or bad

3383
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:51,200
Message received you got it

3384
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,248
Exactly what you're doing

3385
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,016
So

3386
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,064
Obviously

3387
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,112
Is is difficult

3388
02:24:58,624 --> 02:24:59,648
Material

3389
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:00,416
Perhaps

3390
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:01,696
Alex's

3391
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:02,976
Stop listening

3392
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,512
Like

3393
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,560
Viscerally grotesque

3394
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:07,584
Probably could be

3395
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:10,912
In the immediate probably just

3396
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,192
Because he

3397
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:13,728
Knows that

3398
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:21,408
If I were to put a button on this episode it would be 300,000 lb and I would drop a

3399
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:23,712
Set from 10,000 ft above the Infowars Studio

3400
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
That's what I would

3401
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:28,320
Super reinforced

3402
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,720
Obviously the main thing

3403
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:36,512
Point is

3404
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,304
This is it a tragedy

3405
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,584
And

3406
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,608
And obviously

3407
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,656
Whatever

3408
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:44,704
Condolences are appropriate

3409
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:47,776
Very sincerely a heartfelt go after the

3410
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:51,360
Families affected the community of Uvalde as a whole

3411
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:53,920
I

3412
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:54,944
Think that

3413
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:56,480
There is a real

3414
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:57,248
Challenge

3415
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,296
In terms of talking about this

3416
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:00,832
Through the lens of Alex Jones

3417
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:03,136
Star next episode will be much more

3418
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:03,904
Difficult

3419
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,928
Because of the

3420
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:07,488
Conflicting and contradictory statements

3421
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:08,512
If come out

3422
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:09,536
And the

3423
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:10,816
The

3424
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:12,608
The malleability of

3425
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:13,888
What's been

3426
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:16,192
Put out by the police

3427
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:18,240
So much that worth

3428
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,312
Best way to put it

3429
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:24,384
I don't believe build

3430
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:27,456
Sitting here now regarding this episode that we have

3431
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,248
A concrete answer

3432
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:34,368
I think it best occasions are probably necessary to get to

3433
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,904
A concrete answer

3434
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,952
And so that will be more challenging

3435
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:38,720
Vain

3436
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:42,560
Say Alex's demonizing trans people in misidentifying

3437
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:45,632
This person is a lot more easy

3438
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,656
To say

3439
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,680
This is what happen

3440
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,728
Yeah and

3441
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:51,264
I think that there will be a challenge

3442
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,080
I will we'll have to cross that bridge

3443
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,408
Yeah

3444
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:59,712
Anyway I hope everyone out there is doing

3445
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:01,504
Doing all right

3446
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,808
We hope that things are

3447
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:06,112
It said there's a little bit of distance

3448
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:07,136
Body

3449
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:07,904
It's still self

3450
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:09,952
Self

3451
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:13,024
At the moment you investigate cop lies he

3452
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:13,792
He just find more

3453
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:18,400
Like every every time they every time that you started like

3454
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:20,192
Do this this was a little bit

3455
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:24,544
This timeline doesn't make sense they're like there's a different timeline in their life

3456
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:28,128
Save it for next time these thoughts Irrelevant for next time

3457
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:28,896
Map

3458
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:32,480
Until then

3459
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:34,528
We do have a website Dan its knowledge fight.

3460
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,320
Hunter nation.org

3461
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:38,368

3462
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:41,696

3463

Emilio Emilio I'm dzx I hope you all have a dreamy creamy sauce

3464
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:48,864
And now here comes

3465
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,888
The sex robots

3466
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:52,192
Holding

3467
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,312
