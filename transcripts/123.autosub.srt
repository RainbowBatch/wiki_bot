00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
Wine

00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352

00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
The first one was the expedition

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
That sounds appropriate for them

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
Why the Bogle in honor of Bogota

12
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600

00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
But the mystery Oreos guys

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
They're okay

18
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,896
I feel obligated to do a review but they're okay

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920

00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Excited about it

25
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,120
Transition is amazing

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216

00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,424
Some donations in policy walk stacked up we have not made progress

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
The last time we hung out

42
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
Odds of the progress toward

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
The end of the month goal

44
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
I don't know what did you just say

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
Do I was announcing the goal

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Terms of the month

47
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Trying to raise 100 extra dollars per month

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
Getting the Alex Jones documentary

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:11,232
Documentary

50
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,096
Those people who I just gave a shout-out to we're already factored into the last

51
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
75% of the Declarations

52
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Every single

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
What I'm doing

54
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
No

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
I told you a little bit about this

56
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
For the show

57
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
I just don't I don't

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Think there's value in talking much

59
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
About Alex Jones

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
In the prison

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
Anymore

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
I think that he is entirely

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
I think that's all he's doing

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Times for something

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
And desperately trying to

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Abstract people

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
From and discredit

68
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
The investigation that Robert Mueller ism

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
And I'm not entirely literally every other Republican

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
I'm not entirely sure why he's

71
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
He's doing that

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
I mean obviously the team sports

73
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Being investigated

74
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
There's some of that

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
But I don't I don't feel like that's a satisfying answer as to why but I can't speculate as to why

76
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
I mean we've we've uncovered him admitting that he's spoken to Russian intelligence

77
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Barely meme

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Absolutely I think that's

79
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Very very likely

80
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,927
Give me a number of times he's done crack

81
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
I wrote an article about this

82
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
On the website

83
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
They might not understand

84
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
The frustration

85
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
2 in terms of Alex Jones

86
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Present

87
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
On the 23rd of January earlier this week

88
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Alex Jones got on air

89
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
One of the most embarrassing things that

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
I've ever seen in my life

91
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Considering that I watch

92
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
He married Dennis Rodman

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
When she ended up doing

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Was

95
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
To give you some

96
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Text Georgia going to keep up

97
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
With all these stupid

98
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Idiot

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,751
I'll tear the world Chris Jericho what's going on

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
So

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
There is talk

102
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
On all week

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Conservative

104
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
And conspiracy boards

105
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
About a mysterious notorious memo

106
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
That has been written

107
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,415
To release and they will release it is absolutely fine

108
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
For them to release it and they will release it at any moment because

109
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,631
Cuz the Bombshells with fiery terrified

110
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
If you read that memo your eyes

111
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
Would explode it's like at the end of Raiders of the Lost

112
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,383
Absolutely all of the Nazis eyes and brains

113
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Very

114
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
56

115
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Such an important

116
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
For so long and they still haven't released

117
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
Play up how important it is without ever actually releasing it experts

118
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
It's not an actual intelligence

119
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,983
Product or anything like that literally nothing

120
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
Which is described it on the plug

121
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
Nothing at the same time until it's revealed what you can't do

122
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Text message of the Seeker

123
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Christmas idea like that

124
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
The moment they revealed that

125
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Everybody who is on the fence web

126
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Consideration of the stuff we were talking about before the trends that Alex

127
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Experiencing

128
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
He's fake intelligence sources

129
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
Zach not being as cool as qanon

130
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
I'm falling for the antifa Soros document

131
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
Researcher found on Fortune the embarrassed

132
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
He lives a weird world of having to get out

133
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
In front of the story that is already always

134
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Already out in front of

135
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
He's been left behind by the

136
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Conspiracy world

137
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Notorious GI

138
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
GOP memo that run around

139
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
So Alex

140
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Gets on

141
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
The 23rd and this

142
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
He lays it out

143
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
Got a lot of sources obviously in Congress

144
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Nope.

145
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
In the federal law enforcement

146
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
I got forces cross

147
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Bored

148
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,671
I have basically reverse-engineered what is in the bombshell

149
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Congressional memo

150
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
My sources

151
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Without them

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
Secret

153
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Play the little game of is this

154
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
By the way

155
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Put it in a sealed envelope inside of a lockbox

156
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
And when the memo is revealed

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
So shall they grab that

158
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
Pull it out and you will know by Rivers engine

159
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
Sources are still reviewing

160
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
Secret information just because you play a game where you like

161
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
No

162
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Top secret

163
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Okay no

164
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,007
You can't say it but is it okay let's

165
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Just play 20 Questions

166
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
You don't have to say yes or no

167
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
You know how in the house weigh

168
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,759
Truth or Dare they have open testimony in the house or in the Senate intelligence committee

169
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:59,903
It's only ask a question about something that is classified

170
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Play I could not

171
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
Confirm or tonight I can't comment on that

172
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Starts to show up

173
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Figure it out with him

174
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
In the document

175
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Are you going

176
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
What are the hour

177
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
A little bit later in the show

178
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,015
Samaritan

179
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,231
It's not bees I give Alex a BTU for what hand

180
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Little bit later

181
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
Alex decides to go full Hog on

182
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
Okay folks I've got to go off air right now

183
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
Drudgereport.com

184
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Our leftist throw fish

185
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
I got to go off air

186
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,855
Asean

187
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Arabic film

188
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Who's advising

189
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
He just said hey here why don't you just have

190
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
There's another memo there writing about this memo

191
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
But here it is

192
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
I got to go off

193
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
This is the classified memo

194
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Sources

195
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Whoever's telling

196
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
So there's a lot of problems

197
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,703
Having is the foreign intelligence service Court memorandum and opinion

198
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Approved

199
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
2016 sex

200
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
7702 certify

201
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
He's been public

202
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Online

203
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Sent at least May 11th

204
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
2017

205
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
When it was covered at nauseam

206
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
It's beesource

207
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,391
Of all of Trey Gowdy and all of that but people are in Congress

208
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Section 702

209
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Yeah cuz it does bring up some issues that

210
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
French

211
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Disgusted on the show

212
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
This is not

213
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
Something secret and classified classified

214
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,263
It is not what the notorious memo that the GOP is been talking about

215
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Playing up

216
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Because it's

217
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Existed for a long

218
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:31,199
Problem and it's an even bigger problem at Alex's thing that William Benny

219
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:36,063
Technical head of the NSA one of his major sources and frequent guest

220
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Sent it to him saying it was

221
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
F****** idiot

222
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Which is entirely paw

223
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
He's in on it

224
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Actively creating propaganda without

225
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Which

226
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
He is f****** with Ally

227
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
Because that wouldn't be hilarious possible but if he

228
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,455
F*** you because because he's on the hook for this

229
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Alex

230
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Because Alex

231
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Document

232
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
If you're playing games you want to f*** with Alex

233
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,071
Cuz it's classified classified what's going to happen to him

234
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Okay first off

235
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
There's nothing there's no legal Ramen

236
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
Suffocation

237
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Classified

238
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
And then we will follow

239
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Like it's not like

240
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Taken seriously by other media sources

241
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
That he's no longer

242
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Adrian veidt

243
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
Just so we can be clear Alex a little bit later.

244
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Here is here's the situation

245
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
No consequences

246
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Even if you think

247
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
That Alex

248
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Dramatic

249
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Him for lying to him

250
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Escape say that

251
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,063
Alex has to continue to believe whatever bulshit

252
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Behind the scenes

253
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Play cookout

254
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
In the future when he makes it over

255
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Clear

256
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
That this is the memo that everyone's talking about

257
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
So then he does this a little bit later in

258
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Which is

259
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Pretty fun

260
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
It's not that

261
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,063
Why were trying to post it they grab control the computer and turn it off and fry it right in front of us

262
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
Used computers

263
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Already published it

264
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
Already got published we haven't told you yet

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Your fool

266
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
6

267
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Hillary Clinton all you

268
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
Daniel computer

269
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,575
I think it Daniel probably is looking at 4 and it was absolutely cannot believe though course not

270
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
Disgust for 7 months there's no global

271
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Pectin in Friday's computer because he's trying to post

272
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
I think he

273
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Means

274
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
That that computer just melt

275
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
I'm I'm going I'm not going to literally

276
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
From top to bottom melted as if it was poured into lava

277
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Kate Daniels

278
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943
That's what's going on

279
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Of course this is the inevitable

280
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Constitutional crisis

281
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Play compared

282
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,631
I love Sunday supplement for me

283
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,751
Very expensive operation

284
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Products.com

285
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Imo's

286
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
So whatever he does alarm clock

287
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Love and Rodger

288
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,647
Got to give it to him

289
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,975
The issue is distraction

290
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
We have

291
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
You have to get in on what

292
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
School on the internet in the conspiracy communities

293
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
And he has to do one better

294
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
And so he

295
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
It's embarrassing

296
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Wait so is anybody else

297
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Hold this bowl

298
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
What

299
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
The internet

300
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Like I'm

301
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
But with this

302
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Their ass but Alex no

303
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
Because everyone on the internet like this isn't going to play

304
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
Quickly but

305
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Doesn't give a s***

306
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
It's a weight

307
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
To try and get more ears on it commercial

308
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
This narrative

309
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Follow to the next day

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
On the next day on the 24th I believe yet

311
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
24th

312
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
He's talking about the Secret Service Test

313
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,271
Birthday text

314
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
So he just jumps to that because that's what I'm talkin about

315
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
That's what I see world is up in arms

316
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Listen to the show today

317
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,791
But I got blown up

318
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Those texts got released and they're nothing

319
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
He's just

320
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Not worth our time

321
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Definition

322
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Because

323
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
That is kind of

324
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
Quintessential decline of the US media

325
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
In the first place

326
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Is that

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Once you start

328
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
We started having a media that chased

329
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
After the internet

330
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
It was

331
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
It was over

332
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Because the internet has

333
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
The shortest.

334
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
History

335
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Once the media star

336
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Chasing the internet

337
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
They destroy their

338
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Right

339
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
This is the same way

340
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
How big of a story

341
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,055
That's forever us

342
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
That's a feather in his

343
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Cap forever

344
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
He has to pretend that everybody else

345
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
He has to pretend that he does though

346
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Because he has to pretend he's

347
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
The king

348
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Of that world

349
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Ready or not

350
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
He's not be the internet is much better at this

351
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Creative

352
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
And he's like

353
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
It's a problem

354
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
And I don't really care

355
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
I Don't Have You

356
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Anyways keep

357
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
There's not much

358
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
We can do

359
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
About the

360
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
I really don't think so

361
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
I think the date

362
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
Look I'm not going to toot my own horn

363
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
But I think I can do pretty decent job

364
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Investigating a lot of

365
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
I can't emotionally handle doing

366
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Is chasing

367
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Bulshit

368
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Reds

369
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
In the immediate that Alex

370
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Throws out

371
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
On my part

372
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
I don't care about the

373
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
I'm not

374
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Interested I'm a check back from

375
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
From time to time

376
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
But whatever everyone's talkin about whatever the newest meme

377
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
But Alex Jones

378
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
I probably

379
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
We'll have very minimal awareness of it

380
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
I'm going

381
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Back in time

382
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
I don't

383
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
I'm only focusing

384
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
Because I think that is

385
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Yeah

386
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
I don't either

387
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
That's her way of coping with your

388
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Disgusting

389
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
It's not draft go

390
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Rather than combating

391
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
Hit head-on no it's not it's

392
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
I can't handle watching

393
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
You showing the price

394
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
It's a bummer

395
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
It's a desperate man raving about

396
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Yeah and it's not

397
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Like I told you before the show I think

398
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Think it's beneath us

399
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Quite frankly

400
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
If you

401
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Started editing

402
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Out

403
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
The Alex Jones Park

404
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Just left in Rodger Stone

405
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Gradle

406
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
I think I'd be fine with it for good

407
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,727
Maybe maybe maybe for a little while

408
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
It was like

409
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Nixon was crazy

410
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Jordan

411
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
Listening tattoo my way of telling you some

412
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
No no

413
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
I found

414
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Some really old

415
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Oh no

416
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
How old

417
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
We're talkin 2008

418
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
No s*** so we're going to a back in the past

419
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Today we'll be going over March 18th

420
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
2008

421
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Calpers

422
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
2008

423
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
It's be what we can learn

424
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Do you know what

425
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Excites me the most

426
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Officially Marty

427
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
I honestly

428
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Expected around of a

429
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Applause

430
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Trivial

431
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
Where do they cover 2008

432
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,135
I mean we're going to be able to cover Obama's election

433
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Cast from the past

434
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
We'll be able to get in

435
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
We're just going to

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Absolutely dismantle 2000

437
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
5910

438
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Trove

439
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
From 2028

440
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
We'll be going back ten years in the past and 10 years into the future

441
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
About aliens

442
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Let's go

443
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Every single app

444
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Prepackaged

445
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Guess what

446
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
James O'Keefe

447
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
First project

448
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,295
James O'Keefe was just interested

449
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
This

450
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,672
Audio package

451
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
A couple of James O'Keefe prank calls

452
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,304
To Planned Parenthood which we will listen to now

453
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
What's your position

454
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
What would I underweight abortion is that apply to minorities to

455
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,872
Typically wanted to underwriting abortion for a minority person

456
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Okay

457
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,624
Definitely way too many blocky for a while so I'm just trying to do my part

458
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
That's what I'm trying to do

459
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
That's a first

460
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
That was real

461
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah it's the sort of thing where you get the scent by listening

462
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
To them

463
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Whenever he proposes that this idea of like

464
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
I'd like to

465
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
To give money

466
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Before

467
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
People

468
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
The way they interpret that is

469
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
There are a lot of people that we don't have access to health care in minority communities

470
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,704
And then like any charity that helps

471
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,568
Anybody who doesn't help on their own

472
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,968
Are also minorities who can't afford it

473
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
More about the people making them

474
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Then the people received

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
Because the positions that they

476
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Advocate

477
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,488
Really out of line

478
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
So

479
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,608
We're do listen to him talk like a white supremacist and not be like

480
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Oh yeah you're a white

481
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
He's playing a character

482
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
You sound very sincere

483
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
Call Autumn

484
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
What about abortion for the underprivileged

485
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Wonderful

486
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,464
Appreciate

487
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
Abortion help

488
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,704
Minority group but that be possible at the black community for example

489
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
Abortion couldn't kebede

490
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,384
Before

491
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,528
Currently on if you wanted to designate that you wanted your gift

492
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
She's being very clear about what

493
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
Accepting this as

494
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Do you have a full of racism

495
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
At this point

496
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
The call could have ended

497
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,128
Because for what he wants to get out of it

498
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
Right

499
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,552
Will accept your but however

500
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,952
Another like 35 seconds unnecessary and probably just

501
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Great because I really faced trouble with

502
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
I want my kids being disadvantaged Dino again

503
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
I just had a baby I want to put in his name

504
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,480
Can I put it in the name of my son

505
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,392
Yeah he's trying to get into into colleges and I'll be applying

506
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
British really big

507
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
What are you doing

508
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Alright

509
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Complete nonsense

510
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
It's just it doesn't prove

511
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
A goddamn thing

512
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
College

513
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Trouble

514
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Multiple with affirmative

515
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
So that means

516
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Everywhere he goes

517
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,744
He gets affirmative action.

518
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
This baby

519
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
People like Alex and Alex

520
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
James O'Keefe is using affirmative action as

521
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Is a racist

522
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Floyd

523
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
To prank

524
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
Planned Parenthood

525
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
It's false

526
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
Align with their beliefs it's just

527
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,856
About that as opposed to being like

528
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,000
Whatever version of their complaints about

529
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
Him on the phone is like this is just letting out what

530
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Michael complaints

531
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
How does that but it's

532
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
It's very much like

533
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Okay

534
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
You're going to make a racist donation that's

535
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
Still a donation to Planned Parenthood

536
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,456
And like all the donations in Mike Pence's name is just like

537
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
The first point is generally their business is making money for Planned Parenthood

538
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,512
They're low-level functionaries who work there

539
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Also there they're just like

540
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
They heard him say I want to make a donation

541
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Navigate to Leslie whatever it is you're saying

542
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Is great I don't care if you give me the card number you even heard of the first one that's like the ladies like whatever

543
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,808
Find believe whatever you want about us

544
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
Killing minority

545
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,928
Sprite

546
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,560
Your racism went so far you're doing good for black

547
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
You're at you're doing good

548
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
As a prank

549
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
I think it was

550
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
We got to that point

551
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,920
F****** piece of s***

552
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,784
Go all the way to otherwise you don't have receipts

553
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
To quote the great Insane Clown Posse

554
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Let's go all the way

555
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Anyway

556
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Great quote

557
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
Thank U next clip Alex Jones her to talk a little bit

558
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
About O'Keeffe

559
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,168
Stunt of a recording called the 500

560
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Because

561
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Consent to

562
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Now it's believed that the person who went into

563
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
The Clinic's pretending

564
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
Can you be pregnant and recording

565
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
I don't know she did time but you did get to

566
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
Some trouble about like a harassment

567
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Recording people without their

568
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,368
Consignment

569
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
This doesn't look good

570
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,376
They are shooting group randomly called seven different out of a list of hundreds

571
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
Chevron

572
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,496
Planned Parenthood they all said the same thing

573
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,800
If you believe that he only called seven

574
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
You're insane

575
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
Giggling snickering

576
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Oh absolutely

577
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
Liberal

578
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
Sprouts

579
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,744
Barack Obama criticizes

580
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
No know they'll be lots of

581
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
They know who they work for

582
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,640
Add more huge transmission today Stay With Me

583
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Okay

584
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Little lizard

585
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
I think he's out horny

586
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
Killing black

587
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,232
Well he's getting into it

588
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
You know like

589
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
You can see flickers of the neck

590
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
2050 at Planned Parenthood

591
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Even hear that guy

592
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
There's the myth

593
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Quoting of people

594
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,800
Acting like

595
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
It's it's

596
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Like to take this document

597
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
From 10 years ago

598
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
Oit present

599
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Why

600
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
I just like

601
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,624
The fact that nobody is bombing

602
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
I guess I got that Snow Buddies

603
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Spray painting

604
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
And all of that was a very was a much more

605
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
Shooting at Lenox

606
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,472
The tea party was not a great organization

607
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
Station hours

608
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,616
Wow they were Proto night

609
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
Discussing the tapes a little bit more and I

610
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Don't think he does a good

611
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
They randomly called

612
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
Planned Parenthood

613
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
Laughing smacking of lips

614
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Right there

615
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,864
The smacking of lips is literally what he says about those people on the planet

616
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
A direct

617
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Verbatim

618
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Example

619
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
It doesn't accurately depict either

620
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Instance

621
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
It's just a weird hang-up he has about people

622
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,272
But smacking the lips somehow like indicates to him Eva

623
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Weird it's

624
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Consistent

625
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,160
I do think

626
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
The second one's word Okie

627
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,584
I'm not going to lie it I think it's pretty good imagery because whenever you hear smacking your lips you think of every animal

628
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,168
Behavior a child an annoying child

629
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
That's what I think

630
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
Weird

631
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Prismatic

632
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,528
There's too many blacks I want this for black so absolutely

633
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,440
And the people that run these I've been around them I've met him I protested them

634
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
They are literally some type of

635
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Weird

636
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Zombie

637
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
They are just the sickest

638
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Cast of Wicked

639
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Cult-like people you can imagine

640
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,592
Don't believe me just go down and go into one of these places and talk to him

641
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
One has to experience the Matrix before they

642
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
You can really be told about it is just better to experience it

643
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,392
You know his call his listeners

644
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Go down there

645
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Talk to them

646
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Yell at them

647
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,584
The Matrix when you're

648
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
Hostile to The Matrix I like the idea that the

649
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
People who are going to work everyday

650
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Not V

651
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,384
Insane people standing outside of the building every day screaming and holding sign

652
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
If you're going to choose which one was the cult

653
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
Would it be the person getting

654
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Payday lifx

655
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
Bright

656
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
Is that like

657
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
You know

658
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,720
The only real relevant conversation here is

659
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Does society

660
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
Overwhelmingly and buying large approve of abortion

661
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
As a medical procedure

662
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
Yeah we've had that conversation

663
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
Should be over to all of this other side

664
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Traffic is

665
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Just

666
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
It's the same thing

667
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Just distraction over here to try in

668
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
Chipaway

669
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Woman's right to reproduction

670
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Did help

671
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
Under the name of racism

672
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,208
Or something else okay so if your argument is

673
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Planned Parenthood

674
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,656
Is yes cuz I can be a

675
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
And then they'll be like

676
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,520
Yeah it will kill minority

677
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Dispel all that

678
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
Claims that all black leaders are globalist

679
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
Which

680
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,672
I don't know one black leader if you could have just stop there

681
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Ben Austin Texas

682
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:41,376
Blackbeard Dallas where I grew up I don't know one black leader in the country about that leader

683
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Six out there

684
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,920
The mainline pimps of the New World Order

685
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
You have there is already a dichotomy that is on sustained

686
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Because he's

687
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Is controlled by the global

688
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
Good ones are dead

689
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
The only good ones

690
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,376
Take a look back through history and see a lot of very good black leaders who have been killed

691
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:18,240
Walmart liquor

692
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
Specifically for being good black leader

693
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
Does not mean

694
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
Necessarily that all of the black leaders that you are 12

695
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Now

696
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
But you said you understand what the

697
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Intention of that argument

698
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
It's to disenfranchise

699
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
And take legitimacy

700
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
Empower away from any black

701
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
But Al Sharpton

702
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
That's just

703
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
Also James David Manning

704
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
How the new world order

705
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
Every major groups people under control

706
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
About the Judas goats

707
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:03,296
They'll give fiery speeches about devil yd all day and then

708
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
Stop their chests and talk about how

709
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
Whites are absolutely Wicked people

710
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
When an average the average white person to guilty in a chicken neck

711
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,568
Limp-wristed person running around with a guilt complex

712
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Rolling out red carpets for black people in my

713
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Some experience

714
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,040
But also we can tell already in 2008

715
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Narratives

716
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,816
Want you to make me feel bad for all the bad things that everybody I've ever known has done.

717
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
The point of saying I don't want to be made to feel bad saying that all white people already unnecessary

718
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Really feel bad

719
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
And he's pointing the finger at them

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,384
Time for that

721
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Position at least

722
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
It in this Ram

723
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Exactly

724
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,160
Which is the

725
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
To take his

726
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
To be so correct that he

727
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,072
His denial then has to spiral further down into

728
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
Insanity

729
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,960
I think it's negative progress

730
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Speaking of which

731
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Navigate to that clip

732
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
To Planned Parenthood

733
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
Singer thing against the different it's a different part of it we've already discussed

734
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
Rosanna KKK

735
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,344
We've already discussed the idea that

736
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
You started Clinic

737
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Specifically in black neighborhoods

738
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
She didn't the early ones

739
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
Women

740
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,424
Which may be the largest issue Clinic

741
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Especially in the early times

742
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
Disproportionately in low-income neighborhood

743
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,592
Because those were the populations they were serving

744
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
Because they needed help

745
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Cuz rich people

746
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
Have always been able to

747
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
What if you make it illegal

748
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Rich people will still have

749
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,624
Neighborhood

750
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Do it the way that they

751
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
Clear the idea that like making it illegal doesn't

752
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
An abortion

753
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Kilwins

754
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Yeah

755
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
From her that's maybe why they

756
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:36,128
Maybe they hide like maybe that's a smart idea

757
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
Find the idea that

758
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Planned Parenthood

759
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
It is

760
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
In order to

761
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
You kind of

762
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Counteract

763
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
The fact that their hatred of it is more massage

764
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Criticism

765
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
Planned Parenthood on

766
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Kind of

767
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Angle

768
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Is massage

769
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Yeah

770
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Women shouldn't be allowed to

771
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Men should be allowed to chew

772
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Right like that's what it really is

773
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,992
22 imagine it is

774
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
It is

775
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Like one of you think

776
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
Planned Parenthood is racist

777
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
You're still a massage

778
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,280
You don't get don't get a pass off

779
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,096
That the murder of babies cuz

780
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
By the way

781
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
And the racism

782
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
Specific

783
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
Exterminate the black community cuz that's what they pretend

784
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Planned Parenthood is doing

785
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Supersedes

786
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
My misogyny this is more important. Of your eye before you criticize the speck in mind

787
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
Understand like

788
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
Why would you need to escalate

789
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
If your argument is there murdering babies

790
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,560
Why do you need to need that because some people

791
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
Stupid and are tricked by the races

792
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
Some narratives regarding

793
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Yeah but

794
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Not racist

795
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Isaiah

796
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Anyway I want to get to this clip

797
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Because we're coming up on

798
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Maybe my favorite

799
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
One of my favorite clips of all time

800
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,392
It's not that but it is

801
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,376
Yeah Planned Parenthood predominantly in the minority areas its mission

802
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
And these are

803
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,496
The official writings and letters of Margaret Sanger and Foundation minutes

804
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,848
Black person is a weed

805
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Be exterminated

806
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
An

807
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
Let's make those letters all these robber barons she was getting millions of dollars and I was given a billions back then she was being on the show

808
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,440
Foundations and how far we've got it higher blackfront doctors because

809
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
The blacks only trust other blacks

810
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:05,120
So that part is we've already talked about that

811
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
How to get black doctors

812
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Wasn't because

813
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
We can trick them probably because

814
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
What that was part of it but the excuse or the reason

815
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,064
Something that she gives in the actual letter is that people are more likely

816
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,624
People of their own social

817
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
Idea

818
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
Opening up

819
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,792
To a white doctor might be more difficult than a black person opening up to

820
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Remember

821
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
This was like in the night

822
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
20 this is not like

823
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Furthermore

824
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
I don't

825
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
I don't either

826
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,848
Person should trust a white person ever

827
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Okay

828
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
Different directions

829
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
I should have known

830
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
Native American

831
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
White person

832
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,672
I wanted to take out of that

833
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Black people being

834
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
He's quoting Margaret

835
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Okay so this isn't

836
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Is it

837
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
Is it in the minutes

838
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
Wealthy there's a quote that

839
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
Attributed to her from 19

840
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
22

841
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
They went around it

842
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:22,944
It says human weeds

843
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
Black soldiers and Jews are a menace to the race

844
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Eddy Grant

845
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,184
Snopes

846
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,976
Finding out what

847
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
The truth of this was

848
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,560
500

849
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Their breakdown

850
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Was it just the word

851
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
No 4:00

852
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
!

853
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,288
Prove difficult as many primary iteration

854
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:56,735
The earliest versions We were able to locate I didn't appear until sometime between 2008 and 2009

855
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
Right when we're talkin about

856
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
Primarily on blogs and message boards

857
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,927
All of these initial iteration site

858
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Does pregnancy centers website

859
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,887
A cache of which can be viewed here and they linked to it

860
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,703
Statements by Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood

861
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
Generation of the quotes

862
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,055
Suggested bracketed paraphrasing

863
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Singers words have been

864
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Been somewhat creatively interpreted

865
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
So

866
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Did you write him in French

867
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
From the website

868
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Is this quote

869
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,623
Immigrants are human weeds

870
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,183
Black soldiers and Jews are a menace to the race

871
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
Eugenic sterilization is an urgent need we must prevent

872
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Application of this bad stock

873
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Eminem quotes

874
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
Margaret Sanger April 93 birth control reviews

875
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
Control review is available online

876
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,383
And they look through that quote doesn't exist in any way we're the citation

877
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
Of course not

878
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
Referencing something I was quoted on message

879
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Switchboards

880
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,623
GE said he's pretending that he did deep research

881
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
Into this and it

882
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
It's not

883
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
You just believe in the house

884
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,047
Even then if it is it if it is in the minutes

885
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Stay lyrics

886
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Right

887
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
This was in the minutes Margaret Sanger

888
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
And it was

889
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Was written down

890
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
In two thousand and

891
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
I was running

892
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Planned Parent

893
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Inside the 60

894
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Looking through

895
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,783
Margaret Sanger inspiration for existing

896
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Notes and I saw that'll be like

897
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
That's it out

898
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Right

899
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
So somehow

900
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,999
That's the posing gun that somebody had a

901
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
Copy of these men

902
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
And pass them down

903
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
Hand-to-hand

904
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
To get to 2,000

905
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,519
Yeah that's really saying this is an oral history

906
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Avulsion

907
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
It sounds

908
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
It sounds Wild

909
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Not be

910
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Super on

911
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Unfair

912
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
Margaret Sanger was

913
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Into eugenics

914
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
She didn't seem to be a racial eugenics

915
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,231
She seems to be a practical

916
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,351
Well yeah unfortunately prevailing theory in the 20

917
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:28,543
Good and it's certainly something that we hopefully all should have moved past at this point

918
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
In the twenties was inextricably

919
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Erase regardless of

920
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
Whatever it was likely likely

921
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
The argument that Alex makes about

922
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,575
Like having

923
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Eugenics

924
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Racial

925
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Eugenics

926
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
It just doesn't stand up

927
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Here's the thing about that

928
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Alright

929
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
No matter

930
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
How good a person you are

931
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Immediately after the election

932
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
There's probably a point where you were like

933
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
What if we did just get rid of dump

934
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
Technically

935
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,431
It's a dangerous precedent

936
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
And you immediately go well that's a bad idea but it

937
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
The same time the thought is there

938
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
Skip this next clip

939
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
It's not as interesting as I thought when I was cutting clips

940
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Play Jewish

941
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
I'm just trying to cause trouble

942
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,887
There we go

943
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,447
Cuz you said it before in the past I was just trying to trace that like

944
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
That's what we believe for you

945
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Oh yeah you.

946
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,151
Betty White the reason I'm skipping it is cuz I need to get to the next clip

947
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
This

948
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Makes me

949
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
This makes me so happy Jordan

950
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
This

951
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Truity

952
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Despite everything I know about him

953
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Horrible

954
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
Part of me

955
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,631
I want it I want there to be a way he can be safe

956
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
You're rooting for the Redemption

957
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,751
It's impossible 2008

958
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
It might have been possible

959
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
And I know it from this clip

960
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,407
Put your mic sound charms

961
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:46,271
Wait for this moment

962
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:59,071
Kris Kristofferson

963
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
I wonder why

964
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
First

965
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Spoiler alert

966
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
But also

967
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
When he just said

968
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Best part right here

969
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
That is

970
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,079
Exactly the point the song where many times I've drunk

971
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
Waylon Jennings

972
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
Where's the beef

973
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,103
Find a place

Can't wait to hear you play the whole Highwaymen song so awesome

981
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:27,295
100 awesome reality

982
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:32,159
He was a radio DJ just did that

983
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Classic

984
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,791
I find that okay just talkin over it a little bit

985
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Even if even if you

986
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Easily through in the

987
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
Also by the way Planned Parenthood is full of racist mods

988
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,823
Anyways

989
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,663
Like he's what I love when you're doing a rillo by morning

990
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,503
The songs about the rodeo Amarillo

991
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
Santa

992
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
San Antonio San Antonio

993
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,439
That's the stuff man where you see those flickers there's like

994
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Bats

995
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Fun

996
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,071
And it's even more surreal

997
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
He was genuinely having a worst thing that ever happened to him is he got popular

998
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,335
God we should go so thrilled

999
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,431
Does Waylon Jennings vs the best part

1000
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
NuWave

1001
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
To interview Alex

1002
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
Don't even bother with asking him questions

1003
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,671
Don't bother with trying to remember when you were

1004
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
Protective

1005
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Well now

1006
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,399
I think he's dead

1007
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Tumi

1008
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
He will always be

1009
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
I can't get over stuff like that

1010
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Reruns of

1011
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
The Dukes of Hazzard

1012
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Hazard nose

1013
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:06,111
How to get a sample of what what I'm talking about at the beginning of the show

1014
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
What I'm talking about the present when he's just on this

1015
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
Attraction b******* go back to the past find stuff he's lying about we can have fun and then I can hear stuff like that

1016
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
Huge piece of s*** but that's Charming

1017
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
That's Charming

1018
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
The reality of him just talking about like

1019
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
Blacks are the real racist group black people

1020
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
I can't get enough of it I love it I love it so much

1021
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,791
Johnny Cash's verse

1022
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,375
The universe divide

1023
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
I'll find a place well Alex

1024
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Or maybe

1025
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
Single drop trailer

1026
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,943
Listen to you and that song and the way you feel about that song and then listen

1027
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,295
To Alex in the way he feels about that song similar

1028
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
You guys are the Batman in

1029
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
And the Joker kind of like

1030
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,183
You're the you're the same Spectrum

1031
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
I am the I am the darker brother

1032
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
A poem

1033
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
Pretty funny.

1034
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,359
Spoiler alert

1035
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Love getting up there and say

1036
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:39,551
Anyway

1037
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Jon Bon Jovi

1038
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,743
You would have made that song great

1039
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:53,887
My burial

1040
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:00,031
I also as a guy name

1041
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Football

1042
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,407
Something else which we will talk about the end

1043
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,711
The guy named Jeffrey

1044
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:14,111
Who just wants to talk about GMOs a whole bunch

1045
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
Interview with dr.

1046
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,303
Jean Adele or something I'm not sure the radio show

1047
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,679
I don't I don't really care to all that much

1048
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
Because

1049
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,799
In the same way that Alex singing the entire song of Highwayman

1050
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
Was endearing and delightful

1051
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Vixen

1052
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
No

1053
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
It's amazing

1054
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,503
Okay in 2008 Alex Jones was still in a play

1055
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
Where he would invite

1056
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
White people onto his show with Judd

1057
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Doctor Dell

1058
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,183
Adele

1059
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Whatever

1060
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Deidre

1061
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Keep smack

1062
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:59,423
In this first clip into vaccine

1063
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
Westside with him

1064
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,823
Should have let Alex to a more intellectual study of the

1065
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,943
We know from history that Alex Jones

1066
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
This ignores everything

1067
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Literal real doctor

1068
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Supposed to

1069
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
Is chiropractor

1070
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,903
The point there really isn't they aren't.

1071
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:26,047
Sodus Point Alex is making the argument that sign Marisol is

1072
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Chemical that

1073
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Painting

1074
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
In vaccines

1075
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
A little bit

1076
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,751
I don't care what the chemical the argues for an hour

1077
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Because I care about that first

1078
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,943
You better show me evidence

1079
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
Health officials admit vaccines may have hurt Georgia girl

1080
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
Federal Blue Ribbon

1081
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,367
Panel this is just a February

1082
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
25th is just last month

1083
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:58,047
Found Emerald her favor this is a blue-ribbon panel

1084
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
Does not imply the vax

1085
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,935
Young child if indeed this is not a court of law by the way

1086
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:09,823
He's making reference to something we've gone over this

1087
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
You have to pray

1088
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
That one case

1089
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,479
Millions and millions and millions and millions

1090
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,087
That's very unusual mitochondrial DNA

1091
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
In combination with

1092
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
Something having to do with vaccine

1093
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
Not for Marisol really carefully

1094
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
May have played a role in

1095
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,191
Nobody

1096
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,871
Smallpox often face of yours where is it

1097
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,967
You don't take that technology

1098
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,503
Because there is so

1099
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,903
It's not absolutely perfect to drive across if you love it and you willing to take a 2500

1100
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Killing yourself is here

1101
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
Americans grow up and understand

1102
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,863
Let me stop you.

1103
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,167
They're actually in and if you'd like

1104
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,471
I'm actually about 50 I'm here in front of me

1105
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,031
So he goes on to say like you

1106
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
My favorite part

1107
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,759
My favorite part was just a robot

1108
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Just the first thing you said was

1109
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
You have to

1110
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,159
To keep reading Alex immediately like

1111
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
I mean

1112
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
But to say it

1113
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
Spring-trap

1114
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,983
So good and Alex Jones starts yelling about like

1115
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
There's so much

1116
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
ISM in the world

1117
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,311
Nyr

1118
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,591
Numbers going up so much

1119
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,991
Tell me he's manipulative Lee using thread autism numbers

1120
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
Reflect reality necessarily be

1121
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,575
Because

1122
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,879
It's great but I'm not sure

1123
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Do you know if you want to talk about Alexa

1124
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
Evolve time in our history we didn't understand

1125
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Various parts of

1126
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
The Spectrum understand how

1127
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Diagnosed properly

1128
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,423
Autistic

1129
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Work

1130
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Presenting

1131
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,847
Chisholm

1132
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,895
Hysteria

1133
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,967
Interesting how many different

1134
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Diseases

1135
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
Have

1136
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Disappeared almost

1137
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
It's

1138
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,951
It's the same thing that you can make these stupid arguments about like I'm sure what you would do

1139
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:40,351
Idea of like the feminization of society

1140
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
Before

1141
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
How many people were trained before

1142
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,615
But either killed themselves or never were, or or never comfortable living in public

1143
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,455
Be captured by statistics

1144
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
Part of life

1145
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,319
That's the way he manipulative Lee uses these

1146
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,343
26in what have you

1147
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Anyway

1148
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
At this point mr. and mrs.

1149
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
I'm afraid your child has

1150
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Has been diagnosed with

1151
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
Douchebag

1152
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
Mr. and mrs. Jones

1153
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
Alex Jones

1154
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
Because

1155
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,615
Doctor

1156
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Adele

1157
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
I keep hearing

1158
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,503
A delightful name

1159
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
But it's not

1160
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,439
I look into one of them wasn't

1161
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
It's dinner time

1162
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,047
Anywhere Alex at this point tries to go in

1163
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
To like

1164
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,399
Here's here's a story I can tell

1165
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,703
This'll prove my point

1166
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
I was in a

1167
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,055
More or less

1168
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
What is doing.

1169
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
Because it's increased

1170
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
Did the Tooth Fairy do I increase autism

1171
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:11,999
And what's going on to wait

1172
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,679
By the way

1173
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,239
There's a lady there at the pool

1174
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
Autistic son

1175
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,127
And I walked over and I say when did this happen how he was 18 months old and let me guess

1176
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,759
Let me see how you know do you know me

1177
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
After that and then

1178
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,367
Let me guess the hospital

1179
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,927
Real quick will get you

1180
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,975
Respond

1181
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Is the story

1182
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Details to present day

1183
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:50,655
This is one of his favorite stories

1184
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,239
This is like this is one of those Road hacks

1185
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Right right

1186
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:00,895
Same power 420

1187
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,271
Man wanted why is it I get the shots in the hospital

1188
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,063
Listening

1189
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Reasoning fallacy

1190
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
That are given to kids are

1191
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Is nothing can happen in

1192
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,999
The trial that is in a week or two after a shot or we

1193
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,815
It seems like there's a relation

1194
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
Insurance

1195
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
Seems like

1196
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,031
We need to find out but we're just waiting and spinning our Wheels not getting to the bottom of autism

1197
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
To put down

1198
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,151
Theory that kind of came

1199
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:37,247
And it kind of went so let's move on why is it so cold

1200
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,855
Why is it that women have certain up testicle problem

1201
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,951
Tomorrow is

1202
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
Clip Alex tries to bring up fluoride today

1203
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
This is a really interesting response

1204
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
I love the way that

1205
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
The doctor is just like

1206
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
Kind of what

1207
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
We will

1208
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,759
Aspire to do TVs laughing

1209
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
Alex

1210
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,439
Come on he's treating me like a child which is a child

1211
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
Stinging do you like

1212
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,047
Grow up grow up

1213
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
Once he laid that out

1214
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
You're like

1215
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Alex what do you got

1216
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,215
Right

1217
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,495
Fluoride

1218
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
Let's take sodium fluoride

1219
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,639
I just said you there in the breast

1220
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
The

1221
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
From the aluminum and

1222
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,111
Of course fertilizer manufacturer that's what they call fluoride

1223
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
But they didn't put in the water

1224
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
And you said I never heard that

1225
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
How to make sure you get email all the mainstream documentation and

1226
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,887
FDA investigators also

1227
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:02,239
CC

1228
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,287
Don't give babies fluoride water

1229
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,335
Right because they're getting plenty of it

1230
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,943
Getting plenty of it as it is you got to be very careful not to saying that they used weight

1231
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Material

1232
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
Fluoride

1233
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,087
I wouldn't be surprised but the same token I can

1234
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
Can take water from your toilet

1235
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
I can reduce

1236
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Clearwater

1237
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
You might say hey I'm drinking

1238
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,303
Do you drink a water it system process

1239
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,119
Factor to Sarasota

1240
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
To make fluoride

1241
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
And there are

1242
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
Little white spots

1243
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,567
On kids Front Teeth

1244
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Comes up

1245
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:43,199
Play come from fluoride Big Harbor

1246
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
Situation where they graduate

1247
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
Did the report about increase

1248
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,927
Navigate to Main Line University

1249
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,463
From China to Japan

1250
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,815
To England where it causes massive increases in that type of cancer and boys

1251
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,399
Massive increases you got to be careful with that

1252
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
In terms of applying

1253
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,727
Cause and effect cuz it might seem so but

1254
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,031
Amion

1255
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
I doubt it

1256
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,295
When you start doing stuff

1257
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
But suppose I have a drugs and I'm putting it on the market

1258
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,207
And I do eight studies in a row to find

1259
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Side effects

1260
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,583
Killing people then the 8th and the 9th study finds

1261
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
We could we could study right

1262
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
Find out hey this is a great drug and doesn't cause side

1263
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
What do you think is going to get published

1264
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
Careful in that you look at in the

1265
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,663
The entire body of the literature

1266
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,527
The membership is 650 who still believe

1267
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
And they do their studies

1268
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
I would not say the controversy with 99.99% of sign

1269
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:03,071
Believe one thing

1270
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
Do we want to go

1271
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:10,751
Because we love the underdog I guess they want to go with a polo 1%

1272
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
The Meg

1273
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,895
He's pushing at the other big governments and banks are doing

1274
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
Toxic waste Nebraska

1275
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,015
They say every sign disagrees with man-made global warming

1276
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
When that's actually not the truth it's the opposite

1277
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,415
Cycle

1278
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,999
I am so you're saying everybody you know they all know that

1279
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,327
Tell me the last time

1280
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,935
But you saw in the history of cyanide cuz I know the few examples here

1281
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,215
You saw that

1282
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,287
.1% of scientists turn out to be right

1283
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
And if they turned out to be right by the way

1284
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
Approved

1285
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:55,551
.1%

1286
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Bi-Rite

1287
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Wow

1288
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
Al-khazneh

1289
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,719
It was the last

1290
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:09,887
I'm not sure but he moved the goalposts talking about fluoride

1291
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
Is pushing

1292
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,007
All right we have a logical conversation

1293
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Keep moving everything

1294
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,871
Okay that's a whole new conversation what the f***

1295
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
Okay

1296
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,807
Ever now

1297
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,159
Alex

1298
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,487
Changing the conversation

1299
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,095
Let's talk about how dumb you are here

1300
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,167
The problem is you want me to

1301
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:46,239
He described you as you want me to come over here cuz I got you

1302
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:51,359
You're actually Stupid Alex that's why you're losing a million-dollar operation

1303
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,175
Yeah you can't do stuff

1304
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,295
Over and over again by a real doctor

1305
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,623
You should have done if he was smart what you should have done is be like

1306
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
Get out get out

1307
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,927
Go go

1308
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
You should have like we lost we lost

1309
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Connection with the s*** out of

1310
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,935
Do curb stomp into the alley

1311
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
The reality is like

1312
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,103
He should have taken some of this to Heart like

1313
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
Locate these are really good point

1314
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
About why my reasoning is flawed

1315
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,807
I'm going to try and do better in the future

1316
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,623
If I were him I would leave the show feeling like s***

1317
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,159
I would leave being like

1318
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
I blew it

1319
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
I blew it

1320
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Nope

1321
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,303
Countless study after study

1322
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,863
It is always

1323
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
Hey whenever

1324
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,935
People are shown to be wrong

1325
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
They just double the f***

1326
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,751
Make it Angry

1327
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
Do you want to believe in your own

1328
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,127
Comped

1329
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Compton

1330
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
Vigilance to not

1331
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,479
Get eaten up by your own b*******

1332
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
Self-criticism

1333
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:14,047
We are constantly evaluating

1334
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,935
Batman figure Joker of the doctor in Alec

1335
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,495
What have you

1336
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,287
This one's good

1337
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Because

1338
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,383
Like this is really just him trying to

1339
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Layout like

1340
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:34,783
Simplistic logical concept

1341
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
60 - 4

1342
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,927
And auntie I mean I'm sure you know you're a medical doctor procedures University

1343
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,487
That a lot of our modern Sciences

1344
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,279
We're dominated by eugenicist

1345
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
Papa Joe

1346
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,839
Thirtysomething

1347
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
For sterilization here

1348
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,703
And that then they went underground with crypto eugenics

1349
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
Underwear that

1350
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,591
But I I kind of I kind of

1351
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
Don't think it's helpful to take our path

1352
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
Mistaken condemned the future

1353
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,039
I agree with you these things have been horrible black marks on the history of science

1354
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
Listen you can say

1355
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,159
America is a horrible horrible country

1356
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,975
Because of all the horrible things we did look at our mistakes

1357
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:24,447
Violence and blah blah blah blah blah on our history

1358
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,983
So I think

1359
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,287
Very very careful in your races issues

1360
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:33,663
The baby out with the bathwater cuz I'm not saying a whole country is bad

1361
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,479
These mad scientist

1362
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,783
Literally I mean

1363
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,879
Watching Project

1364
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,695
He was there when it was Eugenics I read books

1365
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,567
I'm saying the vast majority of the captain

1366
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
You know what I mean

1367
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:08,223
50 years ago almost everybody at the highest levels of Science in this country and England in Germany

1368
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
What's a raving racer

1369
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Just everybody knows

1370
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,087
50 years ago most people were

1371
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
America and I would say we

1372
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,583
We haven't we had and still have a problem with all this

1373
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,983
Year of doing the

1374
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
Finally found

1375
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
True heroes

1376
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
I'm an ass man

1377
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,919
He's everything I've ever wanted

1378
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
Going to take a step back cuz I don't know enough about him and might be some like really terrible s*** that he's gone or

1379
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:50,463
For dark hair

1380
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,791
I have no idea I'm not willing

1381
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
2

1382
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
Totally about ramp

1383
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Don't bring this in

1384
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
Spring reality

1385
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
You know how how long

1386
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
How hard

1387
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
I have wanted

1388
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,919
A true hero on our Infowars podcast

1389
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
Beautiful

1390
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Is patient

1391
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,039
Kind

1392
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,367
Enjoying himself and his

1393
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,183
Constantly slapping Alex down are you sure

1394
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
Suck it

1395
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,535
Just heard the man I want my father to

1396
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
About Jesus that's all that's a lot

1397
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,191
But I mean in that last week there we saw him explain to Alex

1398
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
What is a composition

1399
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:37,823
Individualism

1400
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,127
It's not really willing to act

1401
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
That is not willing to do any of this work is that willing to

1402
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
Deal with the world reasonably and I love

1403
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
Love the idea of this guy

1404
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Just coming in

1405
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
I'm out

1406
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:55,487
Multiple commercial breaks

1407
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:00,095
It was like it was like if your bombing if your bombing you still want to try and go out

1408
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,375
Laugh like you

1409
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,423
To try and go out on a, gotcha

1410
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
Never Comes

1411
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Doing his introduction

1412
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
You made it

1413
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:18,015
You made it seem like let's see if he shows up I'm going to get them

1414
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:23,903
I don't want to treat it like I don't like

1415
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,951
Arguments as though there's a winner and a

1416
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,535
Like you and I are

1417
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,863
It's not about trying to win but I feel I feel I don't feel great

1418
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,471
I knew I like to I like to learn I love being wrong

1419
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
Lego

1420
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
Just like you were saying

1421
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
When the icon I feel like a loser an argument about whether the return to innocence was a good song.

1422
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
He's talking about his Wendy iconoclast

1423
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Is right

1424
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Science what he

1425
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,135
He didn't get to finish

1426
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
Was science goes

1427
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Batshit

1428
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
And

1429
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,839
Love it for everything everything

1430
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Think about

1431
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,191
Also is that

1432
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
When the iconoclast

1433
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
Is right

1434
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
It's because they have

1435
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
Proof

1436
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
Exactly

1437
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
Obligation

1438
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
These things

1439
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
Do you have the album

1440
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
Listen to be like

1441
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
I'm wrong

1442
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
This guy proved

1443
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Right

1444
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
The difference

1445
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
So that's why I don't like

1446
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,207
Azul winter loose thing

1447
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,303
I like whenever I'm wrong cuz then I get to learn

1448
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Like that's crazy

1449
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
It change

1450
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
Just the way that I feel about

1451
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
Chris gethard model of life

1452
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:47,359
How many of our conversations have ended with me saying you know what

1453
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:53,503
You're right and I've changed my opinion on the show a bunch on the Shelf

1454
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,319
In public I will admit my failure

1455
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,927
I'll see you in hell about how I should love Kanye

1456
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
You should love

1457
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
The doctor

1458
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
And now this guy named Jeffrey

1459
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Smith comes on

1460
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,703
Basically all he's doing is talking about the evils of GM

1461
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Fair enough

1462
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
Two stomachs

1463
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Disagree

1464
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,639
The GMOs are as dangerous as people like Alex make them out to be

1465
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
The GMO company

1466
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,735
Monsanto's of the world

1467
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,575
Problems and the idea GMO then the problem is

1468
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,855
Does unilateral mean

1469
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,439
Sprite and patent

1470
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
They're not so much

1471
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,631
Scientific problems

1472
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,959
If this guy comes on and he has a laundry list of these

1473
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,495
Specific examples

1474
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
A people

1475
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
Investigating

1476
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
GMOs

1477
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,895
They got screwed over and what have you

1478
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
I don't believe it

1479
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
Even have the time

1480
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,015
Teresa

1481
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
One of them stuck out to me

1482
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:03,647
Because it's an argument that Alex will continue

1483
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,951
This is another example of the

1484
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Genesis

1485
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
Of one of his

1486
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
Against GMOs

1487
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,887
I've done it was dr. Jean Adele f****** with him while wearing a fake booty

1488
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,935
A fake voice and glasses

1489
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
No it's not

1490
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Is Jeffrey Smith

1491
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,519
You list out this

1492
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,127
Here you give the specific example of someone

1493
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
Fujiyama Lobby

1494
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Alright

1495
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Another example

1496
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,903
Irina ermakova

1497
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,463
I interviewed her at the EU Parliament

1498
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,999
We gave a presentation there

1499
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,351
He had the documents piece of paper

1500
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,679
One day and a piece of paper was burnt under desk kind of has a warning

1501
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
Some of her samples at

1502
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Open stolen

1503
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
Told by her

1504
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,383
Her director into no longer do research on genetically engineered Foods

1505
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,503
Viciously in a public Review-Journal that have lights

1506
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:05,855
Telling her that she was going to be bothering an article about her research

1507
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
And it turns out

1508
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,415
They just wanted to set her up

1509
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
So what was her crime

1510
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,023
For her crime was discovering that rats were fed

1511
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,071
They were fed genetically engineered soybean

1512
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,143
History of spring tide in more than

1513
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
50%

1514
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
Compare to The Offspring

1515
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,239
The rats that were fed

1516
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,311
Regular soy Italy died at about 10%

1517
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,871
He also founded the signs of the office

1518
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Spring when the mothers were fed GM

1519
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,735
So I was much smaller they couldn't reproduce

1520
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,783
Her crime was simply

1521
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,111
Eating rats genetically engineered store that weed everyday

1522
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
And discovering

1523
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,439
Deaf and problems in the office

1524
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
So

1525
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
This has now been

1526
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,047
Absorb

1527
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
By Alex Jones

1528
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,375
The Peace of his narrative about what the globalist

1529
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Want to do to us

1530
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
And uses it to say

1531
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Studies have shown

1532
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,031
The GMO

1533
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Yu-Gi-Oh die

1534
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,127
Much sooner and are unable to reproduce

1535
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
Smaller

1536
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
Then

1537
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
Normal rats

1538
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
And that's what

1539
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,575
You which I say

1540
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
He says

1541
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
The Regeneration

1542
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
I are unable to

1543
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,095
Produce that doesn't make sense

1544
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,631
Nor is it

1545
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,167
Reasonable

1546
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
And I looked

1547
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
Into this a little bit

1548
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
Simply not how

1549
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
It's not possible

1550
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
For that to be a legitimate

1551
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
Conclusion of your article

1552
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,735
But there are so many other variables

1553
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
That you have abs

1554
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
Absolutely not

1555
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,855
Like if you do a regression analysis of

1556
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
A study

1557
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,415
And then any other studies

1558
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,231
You would find out that ate hers is an anomaly

1559
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Well actually there a bunch

1560
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,839
The critic

1561
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
You know science

1562
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
Together

1563
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
Petit Coeur study looked into it

1564
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,079
Because she refused to

1565
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,991
She just went around spouting the The Binding

1566
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:13,343
Arena ermakova macova

1567
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,647
Natural biotin

1568
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,183
Technology where they tried to get to

1569
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,463
The bottom of a number for clay

1570
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
I got a eight.

1571
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Dennis office

1572
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,959
You know how popular natural biotechnology is

1573
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
You can't of

1574
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751

01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
Everytime I go to Walgreens

1576
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
Trying to buy cigarettes

1577
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
Natural biotechnology

1578
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
Everywhere

1579
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,711
It is the most

1580
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479

1582
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
There's no magazine

1583
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
More noticeable

1584
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
Franklin

1585
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
It's f****** Ennis

1586
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Escapable

1587
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
How popular natural

1589
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,119
Yeah boy

1590
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
I just want

1591
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Morris Day

1592
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,471
That the thing I read most

1593
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
More than any

1594
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,287
Book more than

1595
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,079
Like have you ever read Google News

1596
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,383
On every option

1597
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,431
Natural biotechnology

1598
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,223
There's always an article

1599
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
Play some candy crush

1600
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Your

1601
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
I'd like the guardian reference

1602
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,135
Technology

1603
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:23,487
The Atlantic Politico

1604
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:27,071
Who knows

1605
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,167
Okay

1606
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
As far as I can go

1607
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,055
Biscotti

1608
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,127
What was the level of morta

1609
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,687
Georgia

1610
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,039
They asked her

1611
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,343
What was the level of mortality of the pup

1612
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
You found in the

1613
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
Control and test

1614
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:56,511
In the first three repeats of the experiments up till five times higher mortality was observed

1615
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
The newly-born pop

1616
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,863
Whose mothers that received the GM soy flour supplementation

1617
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
Compared with pops

1618
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,191
From rats receiving Protein Isolate

1619
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
Traditional side laboratory Chow

1620
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,519
Which are the control group

1621
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,055
Pops from Rhapsody

1622
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,895
Inside a GMC diet died mostly during the three weeks following

1623
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
Blah blah blah she goes on

1624
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
2

1625
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,015
I'll give I get a couple of

1626
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
Looking over this

1627
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,951
Here was the assessment

1628
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,375
Pup mortality is usually reported at Day Zero or day

1629
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
Causes of deaths are not report

1630
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,239
Provided

1631
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,311
Show that 8.1% of Pops died in the

1632
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
The control group

1633
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
The typical mean pup survival

1634
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
Observe for wistar rats

1635
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
Is greater than 90

1636
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
Plus or minus

1637
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,759
2 at day one

1638
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,551
+ 99.54

1639
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,831
10 + -1

1640
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,111
8 day 21

1641
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
The abnormally High

1642
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
Instapot mortality in the

1643
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Controls

1644
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,975
Poor animal stewardship

1645
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,815
Possibly arising from poor animal husbandry

1646
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
No Valentine Tif

1647
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
The conclusions can be based on a study with

1648
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Poor performance

1649
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Control group

1650
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,263
Table one also reports 10% mortality on

1651
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,287
Conventional soy

1652
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
No conclusions could be drawn

1653
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
From a study

1654
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
In which the convention

1655
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
Control mortalities

1656
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,688
Fire

1657
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,480
The normally Observer with DAR rat

1658
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:24,576
Okay that's the first problem

1659
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,624
The first criticism of the study

1660
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
Is

1661
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
You killed

1662
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:34,816
Right right whatever the case is whatever the condition

1663
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
You had

1664
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:43,520
Dance Ali higher death rate

1665
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Line of York

1666
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,592
Control group is unacceptable for science

1667
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
That's based on

1668
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:52,224
Every other control group

1669
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
And you have

1670
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
You're the one who's wrong

1671
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:02,976
Before we begin the claims issues making

1672
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
Of the gm01

1673
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,608
Being lower weight

1674
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
Your mother's fed GM soy

1675
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,936
Supplement

1676
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
From Rats of the

1677
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
The positive control

1678
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
Group or from the conventional soy flour

1679
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,616
You found that 33% of Pops in the rats

1680
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Controls

1681
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
So the critic

1682
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Sad

1683
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:32,928
Individual animals and illiterate then averaged desmeon for females and mean for males

1684
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,952
To account for gender

1685
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,000
Fable 3 does not

1686
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
Is not separate

1687
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
The two

1688
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
Table three

1689
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:44,960
Stupid does not segregated by gender

1690
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,520
Percent larger than females at this age

1691
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
More importantly

1692
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,128
Under carefully controlled conditions.

1693
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
Is approximately

1694
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,688
38 Grand plus or minus

1695
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,272
Will vary by no more than plus or minus ten percent

1696
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:02,624
The data in table three are presented in an unconventional manner

1697
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,904
Determine the exact mean

1698
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,952
And standard are derivation amongst

1699
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
Table three states

1700
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
53% of control pops

1701
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
Are below 30 G

1702
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
Which is abnormally small

1703
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,168
A two-week-old with star wrap top

1704
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,032
More than 90% of wrap-ups fed conventional soil more than 20% below normal

1705
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:23,616
GM story 9% below normal weight

1706
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
Approach

1707
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
And isolate said pop 78

1708
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
Fair someone

1709
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
Do you know otherwise variance in data in table three and the high percentage of low weight animals are clear indicators of malnutrition

1710
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
Environmental condition

1711
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:40,256
No conclusion can be made about abnormal development

1712
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
Unless they can

1713
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,352
Controls conform to International observe Norm

1714
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,400
Do you know why

1715
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,192
There's no greater

1716
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:49,984
Own

1717
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Then the science Zone

1718
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
Because it's

1719
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
Equivocal

1720
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
Like any

1721
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
Anytime you see a spa

1722
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
Patin

1723
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
Pacific Journal where so many people are like

1724
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,552
Okay here's why you're wrong

1725
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
It's always the most

1726
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,672
Thorough specific examination

1727
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:13,792
Line by line of why everything you did was wrong but there's no way around

1728
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
You even

1729
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
Brian come back

1730
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
You're just going to be like

1731
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,656
Yo William

1732
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,448
Saw the song that date like you've got

1733
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,800
Okay this is why your process was wrong

1734
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:28,640
You should probably didn't follow

1735
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:33,760
Different variables that could be affecting the outcome

1736
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
So in Japan

1737
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
People got together

1738
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,600
The study in 2000

1739
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,160
Seven witches

1740
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
Yeah and

1741
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,000
Atlas 2007-2 Alex

1742
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:50,912
Should know this get this in the scholarship at the time that you going on Alex Jones Show

1743
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:53,472
And touting this as an example of groundbreaking

1744
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Who studies

1745
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,520
He doesn't know about this

1746
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
Vape

1747
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Didn't

1748
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,848
Just do a short-term

1749
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,128
Study like she dead

1750
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:07,808
Didn't entire year they follow follow the guidelines

1751
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,440
Control groups and standardization entire finding

1752
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,512
Read

1753
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,072
That dumb lady is dumb

1754
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
Gross necropsy findings

1755
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,240
Hematological in Serie A biochemical parameters Oregon

1756
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
No meaningful difference

1757
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,592
Between rats fed the GM and non-GMO

1758
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,176
These results indicate that long-term intake of

1759
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,968
Genetically modified

1760
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
At a rate of 30% in a diet

1761
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
Has no apparent adverse effects

1762
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
So

1763
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
So he can

1764
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,888
I mean I mean the

1765
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,680
Non-use of that now

1766
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
Cuz it's not like

1767
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
He's a loner unique

1768
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,336
You know like his guests is doing what he owes assholes

1769
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,360
He's gay

1770
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,944
Is someone whose business it is to know about Guillermo issue

1771
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
His guess is coming on

1772
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,112
To discuss this issue with somebody whose business it is to lie about

1773
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
More the point

1774
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,208
But that's like a

1775
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:18,976
You're running

1776
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,512
Look

1777
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,840
You're the difference is I'm I'm responding

1778
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
Ending to what I asked

1779
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
Expect

1780
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Alright

1781
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,984
Expecting an ID

1782
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,032
Idealistic Viewpoint that will never

1783
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
Passing these Liars are always going to

1784
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
What we need to do

1785
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,664
Kill all the dumb people Eugenics forever

1786
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,088
The argument that I'm making is that even dating back to

1787
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
The 2008

1788
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
It's very clear that

1789
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
The guest that he has on

1790
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:51,744
With exception of dr. Dina Dell

1791
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
He's got

1792
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
Are still propaganda

1793
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,632
Yeah there's still people who coming on with an agenda that doesn't match

1794
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
Reality

1795
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,216
Because

1796
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,288
One of the most important things I think with going back into the past

1797
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,360
I already told you

1798
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,768
Someone just asked Jordan friends outside of the podcast

1799
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,960
We'll see we'll see if we go get a drink after the show

1800
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,896
At this point in history

1801
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
2008

1802
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Alex Jones

1803
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
As far as I can

1804
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
Intel isn't selling youngevity

1805
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064
You haven't gotten into the game.

1806
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,136
He plays now with

1807
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:57,280
I didn't hear a diamond gusset commercial on this episode but we'll see I will keep you posted

1808
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
You started selling

1809
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,400
Some supplemental

1810
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,680
But he's not selling them

1811
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Advertising

1812
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:09,568
For them

1813
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,592
How to say like what is he

1814
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
He selling it

1815
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
Yukon men with

1816
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,688
Come on.

1817
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,992
Are shockingly all for his

1818
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
Documentaries

1819
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,856
Loose change

1820
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
And stuff like that

1821
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
Commercials

1822
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,976
Dollars for a postcard

1823
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,024
Soap

1824
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,400
Commercials that he plays cuz these aren't episodes with the commercials cut out

1825
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,680
Most of them are kind of like

1826
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
This is local radio

1827
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,520
You know I bikes

1828
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,104
We seen his contract in present-day andweknow like

1829
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
Breakdown of time

1830
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
He gets four

1831
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,224
Right. I think it's possible that back then he didn't

1832
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,504
Have

1833
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:54,112
Time commercials that are on there are four

1834
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,648
Gcn affiliate

1835
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Has a soap

1836
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,048
Person who is an Advertiser

1837
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,936
He's big but he's not huge

1838
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,496
So anyway the reason I brought it for supplement thingy

1839
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,312
Is he says something on this episode that is particularly weird

1840
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,592
Considering what we know about

1841
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,176
Alois colon and body cleanse

1842
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:22,528
I don't make an extraordinary climate just cleans out your guts and is a detoxifier

1843
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
Asbury Park

1844
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Did that make you

1845
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
Sprout wings and fly Rattler forever

1846
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,208
The other supplement pictures I don't be associated with that

1847
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,256
Okay this is just

1848
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:36,352
The good stuff it's just it's associated with his future self

1849
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
I'm confused

1850
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,216
Boy means like we're not making any wild claims

1851
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
DNA

1852
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,544
Keep your DNA

1853
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,080
Together in order to make you live longer

1854
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Fair enough

1855
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,456
Fair enough

1856
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,784
I have

1857
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,624
Specifically because that's the end of your DNA that as you age they

1858
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Continue.

1859
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
But at the same time

1860
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
He's also right

1861
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,792
It's just it's just ironic

1862
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
2080

1863
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:13,984
Nobody

1864
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,544
So at the end of the episode

1865
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,360
A bunch about the economy

1866
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,640
How things are bad

1867
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
Now we know from history

1868
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,224
Did get pretty bad

1869
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,504
This is 2008

1870
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,160
Come on

1871
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,024
If you know it's standard operating procedure for

1872
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
Alex Jones

1873
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Anycast

1874
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,584
To say

1875
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
The house is on fire

1876
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,168
Yeah but

1877
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,008
In this case I accidentally were right

1878
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,824
Chapman is on

1879
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
I don't care about what

1880
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
You saying because

1881
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,920
No it's difficult

1882
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,968
To parse out like

1883
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
Mark

1884
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
We're in March okay

1885
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
So this is

1886
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,856

Palladium Platinum

1905
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,824
If you got more money than just give for a few Colonial into some of the mining stocks I'm not going to advise him

1906
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,664
If you want more rest like Bob was saying maybe he'll give us some advice and what's in the

1907
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Forecaster

Between 1005 and 1013 today

1914
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,776
They're trying to suppress it it's not working

1915
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:30,432
And I know I just a little bit more so little bit more gold from you you know I don't have a lot of money but I bought a little here little there

1916
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200

Tell folks about the offer you've got today

1918

Of course Alex right now we have the British sovereign coin it's a real gold coin

1919
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
The great coin

1920
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,696
So that's a disgraceful at pivot

1921
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
But like

1922
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,768
Is nowhere near as professionalism

1923
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,328
Well I don't know it snow

1924
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,472
Because of what we know about Alex

1925
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,520
His business model and how he behaves now

1926
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,312
We know that what he does

1927
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:02,688
He tries to create an emotional response in people through some narratives and then payments to an ad

1928
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
Is it like this is what'll make you feel better

1929
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,344
Having a whole segment Bob Chapman talking about the economy

1930

01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952

1934
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,656
Yep all that is why we have somebody who sells gold

1935

1936
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,008

Beyond

1950
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,168
What actually ended up getting

1951
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,960
The bullion license

1952
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984

1964

Vinyl siding with Bob Chapman the international forecaster.com

2003
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,896
Thanks for thanks for having me on Alex

2004
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,968
Guy who I own

2005
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,272
Thank you so much for bringing me on

2006
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
Contractually

2007
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
Like you have

2008
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,112
To do all the time

2009
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,928
This kind of brings us full circle

2010
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
To the beginning

2011
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
And that is

2012
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,304
10 years ago

2013
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,840
And today Alex Jones

2014
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,120
Both iteration

2015
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Incredibly desper

2016
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,472
He's a desperate man right now

2017
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Provide cover

2018
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Distraction for

2019
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,152
Regarding the investigation

2020
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:45,920
With Mueller

2021
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,736
You go back to 2018

2022
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,016
2000

2023
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,344
And he's not a star back then he's not big time

2024
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,440
Probably this point broadcasting out of a very small Studio

2025
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:00,512
He's not the the glamourpuss that he is now

2026
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:08,704
He doesn't get the supplement stuff until like 2013

2027
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Yeah it's so at this point

2028
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,568
All he is all he's got

2029
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Is a gold show

2030
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,640
He's desperate

2031
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,432
To appease Ted Anderson

2032
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,248
Yeah I mean I don't know

2033
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,552
I would say he's probably more desperate

2034
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:29,952
Now I think he was just desperate in both cases and which one is more

2035
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,720
Equus now

2036
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:34,304
As opposed to being a aggressive

2037
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
Apologist

2038
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
Fair

2039
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
You like okay

2040
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,448
Here's a here's a question that you just

2041
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,472
Raise up in my

2042
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,776
Raise up Boblo

2043
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,568
So he is

2044
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,104
We we know he

2045
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,152
He's desperately obfuscating

2046
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:49,920
And lying

2047
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,224
From the Mueller

2048
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
But I think

2049
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,088
It's not even

2050
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,880
That that's primarily motivated

2051
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,416
Okay I think there's a

2052
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Some chance

2053
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
To some extent

2054
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
But what he's distracting from

2055
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
How unimportant

2056
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
Compared to the internet

2057
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:12,704
Ego-driven

2058
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,848
He's from the fact that he's not as in Port

2059
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,664
Qanon or read it borderforce

2060
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
Or something like that

2061
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,736
Yeah that that could be part of it

2062
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
But

2063
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,344
I don't know anymore in the general

2064
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Of like

2065
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
Alex doesn't actually

2066
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,488
Like Alex can't have any kind of a

2067
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:38,048
Insider information on that

2068
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
As We Know

2069
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,144
The truth

2070
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,240
William

2071
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,288
He said that that was the memo

2072
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,336
Let me know the only reason

2073
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,360
Isn't that he is

2074
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,640
Working so hard

2075
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
It is just because

2076
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
He's in the tub

2077
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,992
Like really it right

2078
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:01,088
No I don't

2079
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,416
The part of it I think I think

2080
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,720
And that's a part of it

2081
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
As part of it

2082
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
The part of it

2083
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,328
I think that he recognizes

2084
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
Conscious level weather

2085
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,656
He's willing to admit it or not

2086
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,936
That most of his traffic

2087
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,216
Bixbi could experience

2088
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
The beginning

2089
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
16 was due to box

2090
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,592
Yeah he's worried about what

2091
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,896
He's also worried about what might be

2092
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,664
The uncovered

2093
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
Connection

2094
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,504
She had that might be

2095
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Implied

2096
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:33,088
Because of it probably even a fourth

2097
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,392
I think it's probably something that we don't

2098
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,440
Probably something

2099
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
From site

2100
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
A little bit

2101
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,536
And

2102
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,120
I don't know we can speculate we're not Alex

2103
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,400
I don't have fake swords

2104
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:50,240
But I know that it will come to Bear eventually

2105
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
Reply.

2106
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,872
We stand outside of Alex Jones

2107
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:56,640
Studio

2108
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Alright

2109
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Boombox

2110
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
Overheads

2111
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
Right

2112
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,760
Highwayman

2113
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,552
I think that would lure him out

2114
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,112
I think it would be possible

2115
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Maybe

2116
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,696
Then we just have a good old-fashioned sing-along

2117
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,512
Like let's do it let's not even fight

2118
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,096
Are going to have a sing-along

2119
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,376
With Alex Jones

2120
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
If you

2121
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
Stab him

2122
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,728
If you all were at

2123
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,752
Bar

2124
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,544
Like a rodeo

2125
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,824
Akbar

2126
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
We didn't get in

2127
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,152
Politics or anything like that

2128
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:29,920
There's a decent

2129
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,712
We could get along

2130
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:36,576
Is exploding

2131
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,136
You guys if you guys ever got close

2132
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,952
Just touched fingers the would like it will be a hundred percent energy

2133
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
Explosion right

2134
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,280
First of all

2135
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
I wouldn't touch

2136
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,120
Second

2137
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
What do you think you feel

2138
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
I think he feels bad

2139
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
Like I would

2140
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,824
I want to I want to walk my

2141
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,872
But I don't think we get along now

2142
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,944
10 years ago

2143
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,248
Long as we have

2144
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,040
Your hair was sometimes when you

2145
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,440
If we applied those same rules

2146
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,744
Race politics religion

2147
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:21,376
Everything but Highwayman probably have a pretty good time

2148
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,752
But

2149
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,288
We do I have

2150
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
Website

2151
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
Can go to

2152
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
Brother

2153
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,432
Michelle

2154
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,648
Something about and I've posted

2155
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:48,000
Far less massive thing about how depressed the world is equally important

2156
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:54,400
And kept their lives in Portland

2157
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,960
Research

2158
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,728
Knowledge

2159
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,800
Book

2160
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,872
We just got a lovely review from a in Austin

2161
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,408
Australian fans

2162
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,944
I believe

2163
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,528
Thank you so much

2164
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:17,184
Yeah I got to assume makes us feel better we like feeling good

2165
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,024
You can listen to us

2166
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:24,096
You can leave a review there as well if you're like

2167
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:30,240
Also if you're listening live and watching on Twitch there's an after-party over on far outstrip

2168
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,032
That far out rhymes

2169
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,592
Believe Nikki Gibson hamburger be doing some s***

2170
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,920
Super fun but

2171
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
In the meantime Dan I think

2172
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,504
Turn like

2173
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,040
Who's who's getting

2174
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
There's no

2175
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
There's no doubt

2176
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Read my mind about this

2177
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
Trey Gowdy

2178
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
Trey Gowdy

2179
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304

2180
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
