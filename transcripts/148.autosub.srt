00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,616
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alec

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
Text Joan

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
Day that may be unusual for the two of us

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,904
Today

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
Cuz you might know a lot about a certain event

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,768
And I don't know anything about us

9
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,632
WrestleMania

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
I do know a lot about WrestleMania you don't know anything about wrestling

11
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I have a ton

12
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
Like their name

13
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
What's up

14
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
For joining up with the

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
I got nothing

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
I got nothing there aren't really any famous Jordan's what about Jordan Peele

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Right Key & Peele

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Jordan Peele

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,384
Go I think you're right

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Horror movies about very much for dinner

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
Why is your name

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
I know is the prophecy brother of mine

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
Oh that's true

24
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
Colts

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
People are in a wrestling called

26
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,592
Yesterday for Wrestlemania

27
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
Done with rest

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
And it's not

29
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
It's not why was this one the back because it's not for the same reasons that a lot of people complain about it love

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
So

31
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
But predictable.

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
It was just like

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
I got to about an hour for as I

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
I don't know why I'm watching

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
I'm exhausted

36
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,176
I think you enjoy your non enjoyment of it to a certain extent I will say that I had a number of thoughts

37
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
In my boredom that we're traveling

38
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,552
The first is that they don't do a great job

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Do not save it

40
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
The Jews could be

41
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
I really think that's a bad thoughts

42
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
Little bit

43
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,448
So within the first 10 minutes or so up the broadcast they played a teaser

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Played like a teaser clip

45
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
For the upcoming

46
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,480
Smackdown Women's Championship match between Charlotte and Oscar

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,600
This is something they do they keep referring to Charlotte as being bred for Supremacy

48
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
I don't like

49
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
It makes me a bit uncomfortable during she's like a blond

50
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
Aryan goddess

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
Well

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,312
This one I'm going to go to the no

53
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Claire

54
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
He used to be involved with a group called evolution

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Genetic evolution

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,280
Related to them you're saying that there might be a defense

57
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,632
Good

58
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,776
Bucket super tall beautiful blond woman whose bread for soupremacy

59
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
That's not great the first couple minutes

60
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Over something I don't know you're talking about

61
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,880
You don't know that Ricky Nelson

62
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Yeah okay

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,000
I do have it real life

64
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,959
Comfortable and this is something that I understand is

65
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Like a

66
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
Necessarily a real criticism

67
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
But they played this

68
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Teaser that's kind of it has a little bit of a Nazi

69
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
In Subway's

70
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
And then they have the men's Battle Royal Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal

71
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
Battle Royale

72
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Found out

73
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
They're all fighting with each other

74
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Guardians of winning

75
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,887
Hardy has he does

76
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
He deletes people

77
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Mr. fruit

78
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Making it delete

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
-2X

80
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
And it's not a Nazi salute

81
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
But boy when it's 70,000 people doing it an arena

82
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
Like the first few minutes I'm watching

83
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
Anything together that kind of bums me out there

84
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Dragged on

85
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
Against some of it was good but

86
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
The only high point for me and I know that I'm

87
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
I made it sound like the f****** stupidest wrestling fan of the world

88
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
He had a shot at

89
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Be a tag team titles have a partner

90
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
I've heard this one because my my long-time buddy Matt elfring right about

91
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Wrestling free games

92
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Does great job over there

93
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
He was very

94
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,775
Very excited about the 10-year old child

95
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,551
I don't care I love the absurdity of it and I don't give a fuk

96
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
It's very fun

97
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Yeah

98
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,183
And then deep the main event was Brock Lesnar and

99
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Roman Reigns

100
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Everyone complains

101
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Games about all that s***

102
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
It's very repetitive

103
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
I just happen to bunch

104
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Just kind of tired of it I don't really care about that aspect of it

105
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
Romans had ended up bleeding a lot

106
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
Gross

107
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
This is disgusting

108
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
I don't care

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:46,527
He cut himself like they do sometimes we have to actually from I learn t'ai learned that in the

110
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
The great movie the wrestler

111
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
I don't care really what the situation was it was grotesque

112
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
And like

113
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
I'm seeing a baby

114
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Very sick

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,887
I'm just not really enjoying any member of the royal family does he have that that haemophilia

116
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
You know that's it okay

117
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
I don't know really enjoyed NXT takeover

118
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Shorter

119
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,271
You're you've become the old movie critic a little bit

120
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
It was a great movie could have got 10 minutes out

121
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
Meanwhile hour and 40 long minute movie give me an hour and 39 hours

122
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Episode

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,751
Reminder f****** talk anyway I thought it was fine but I don't know I don't know how much

124
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Future but exactly as much

125
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,295
Disillusioned after every single pay-per-view and you keep

126
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
It's just boredom

127
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Anyway

128
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Today Jordan

129
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
That was what that was dedicated

130
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
We're going to be going over is

131
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,959
Because Alex has been out of Studio C

132
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Thursday

133
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
He's going to Washington d.c. press conference

134
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
Long Trek via covered wagon

135
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,135
Troy hosting on Monday Mike Adams hosted on Sunday and then visit a best of on Friday

136
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,767
There's not a whole lot to work with here put it out on Tuesday

137
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Instead of Wednesday this week

138
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
Because we might need to have an

139
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
MC recording

140
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,495
Prescott

141
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Backloading

142
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
All right for this

143
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Ridiculous press

144
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
On Tuesday

145
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
So I decided let's go back to the past

146
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Yes we have been like that movie

147
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
The second one

148
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Back to

149
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
The third one

150
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
Where they went backpacking frame

151
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Jordan

152
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
We had been going back to 2008

153
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Looking at stuff

154
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
I've come to the issue that

155
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
I keep listening to episodes

156
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
And they are like

157
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Clips

158
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,591
Of interviews that he did have on a previous episode

159
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,455
Splice together and stuff it's just

160
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Time-suck

161
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
In 2008 so I decided to jump forward a bit

162
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,135
Find ourselves in June 2000

163
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
Today we're going to be going over the first

164
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Second and third of June 2009

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
Let's see what happens

166
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,823
Put your cards that are behind your vest I don't know what what's the saying

167
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
Hematite not good you're not good at it interesting stuff those going to be there going to be

168
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Samara

169
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Just like I was interesting to see the snapshot of Alex Jones from almost a decade back

170
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
A bit of these 2009 episodes

171
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
And it's much

172
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
More like it's a radio

173
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Has boots women 2008 worth

174
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
Sometimes the radio show and then sometimes you just

175
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Here's a mishmash of shows for

176
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
We will go back to 2008 event really cuz

177
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
We got to cover like the election

178
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
Right

179
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Obama

180
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
I think

181
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
I don't know we all lost

182
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
Like a terminal Alien versus Predator situation

183
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,279
Whoever wins we lose we start here on June 1st

184
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
2009

185
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
And the first thing that I noticed right away

186
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,007
Is the Alex has a very different way of like Scholars are very different.

187
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
His collars are all in it for themselves

188
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271

That's all we ever sung about with everything you guys talk

214
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
And I would like

215
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
You get someone to put overdub some of your voices on some blank track

216
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Premier programs

217
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
The Scream

218
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Same thing

00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
No freeplug

221
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
It's amazing 81-85

222
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Another call from another guy

Anna

226
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
I've got me a radio show starting on Saturday morning

227
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Coming up starting this Saturday

228
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Quick plug on it real quick

229
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Alright

230
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
Eternal vigilance for Dustin freon on Revolution broadcast

231
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
Anthem.com they're going to run it from 10 a.m. to 12 noon

232
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Car shows this weekend

233
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,679
Stream travel opportunities get a chance to do this and I Alex Jones is my inspiration

234
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Spoiler that show is no longer on

235
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
There's this sense

236
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
It like Alex

237
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
People think of Alex is like a way that I can

238
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Can get my thing out

239
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Which is the current temperature

240
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Still operating on

241
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
Some sort of like local radio vibe

242
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Like I almost Public Access show kind of

243
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,863
I was like ideas of somebody giving out their website

244
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
In a

245
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
10-second

246
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Clips

247
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Like because

248
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,335
If you've ever given anybody a website there they're like Okay spell that for me

249
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
End

250
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
People are

251
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
On their computer ready to type it in as I speak people are recording this and are willing to listen

252
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Send back to it

253
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,023
To get it right there's no way

254
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,423
It's probably in the Coast to Coast AM

255
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
I just think it's fascinating with that sort of the vibe that's going on

256
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
With Alex

257
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:46,527
We get to local radio

258
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
He's like oh he's like one of the failed comedians from the 80s who

259
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Became a regional

260
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
Radio station DJ abs

261
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
Promotional

262
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
League Baseball's first day of the year

263
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Yeah yeah

264
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
What is the narratives that even worth going over there all kind of just

265
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Nonsense

266
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Screaming about

267
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Everything is about to collapse

268
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,527
Would understand but 2009 surgically

269
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
That's sort of feeling

270
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
People have to feel whenever everything had already

271
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
A reason article about Society about to

272
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Collapse from Pravda

273
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Just fun

274
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Do they sell those purses

275
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
The Devil Wears Prada

276
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
He also screams about how Congress is being blackmailed

277
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
He doesn't mention anything about

278
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
He said he also doesn't bring up the pedophile blackmail or anything like that it's just

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,623
Some service regular old black man

280
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
3D screens about how

281
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
Supreme Court Justice nominee Sotomayor is a racist

282
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Goes on some of that

283
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
I remember her confirmation and reading up on her

284
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,847
The consensus at the time was very much like

285
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
Well she's she's more of a

286
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Centrist liberal

287
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Like center-left

288
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
If you read her decision she's been

289
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Pretty hard

290
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Pretty heart

291
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
I like her

292
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Go to now

293
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Is a guy by the name of Eric

294
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,823
Blackwater Blackwater

295
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
Great episode

296
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Alex now calls him a great Patriot

297
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
Hero because he's involved with a lot of trump Shady dealings

298
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Is deeply involved

299
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
Trump let's hear what he was saying about Blackwater back in 2009

300
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Yep

301
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
That's the same thing that

302
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,167
Blackwater worldwide

303
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
What the f***

304
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
What the f***

305
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
How do you still work for those very same people who go from there to

306
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Abandoning

307
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Simple

308
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
Conservative principles

309
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Ever been ill

310
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Has been

311
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Demolished

312
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Absolutely

313
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
That applies to

314
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
A SeaWorld just

315
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
As equally

316
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
Yeah you know the icing

317
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Pretty accurate picture that

318
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Blackwater AR

319
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
Murdering Thugs and death emergency

320
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Pretty much

321
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,015
Conveniently forget that the same guy who ran that

322
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
All about it being a great Patriot

323
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Probably left

324
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Duda morality

325
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Probably

326
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
If I know anything about Erik Prince

327
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
It's that morality is

328
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,143
Is high on his list right right

329
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
You see these

330
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
There's a ton of them

331
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
Haha that is

332
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,103
Pretty consistent throughout Alex Jones

333
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Early career that were finding

334
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Thing is

335
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Weird commercials

336
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,623
Zoe we love of course anytime we get to hear a new country song from Diamond got absolutely I wanted

337
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Nowhere to hide my gun

338
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Pre 2015

339
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
This won't top those

340
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Football

341
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
Summer's coming to learn self-sufficiency

342
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
If you're going to eat from Nature's Bounty

343
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
There's a learning curve experience is the best teacher but that means time

344
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,335
To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lifted

345
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Hawaiian food knowledge package

346
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,135
The books gives you an in-depth reference with all of The Insider know how you'll ever need

347
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Enter wild card

348
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
Parts are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork

349
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,095
Wait for it

350
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Not years

351
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
I can vouch that Linda's the real deal

352
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,591
She's my mom and I watch TV

353
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
Knowledge is power

354
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
Better take I think the storms coming

355
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
That's crazy

356
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
I want that book now

357
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
And there was like,

358
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
Thunderstorm sound

359
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
Need to fill this 30-second spot

360
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Better have a thunderstorm sound effect

361
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Yikes

362
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
Tell me more about a gourmet survival

363
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Sand ramps

364
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,999
I got to get some of those great brooms

365
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
You can find the right one

366
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
But a lot of those are poisonous

367
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Value need that book

368
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
The greatest teacher is experience

369
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Which I feel like they should not be selling on their ad for

370
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
Don't

371
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
Exactly what time is short

372
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Storm coming

373
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
So

374
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,295
We know we know that one of Alex Jones

375
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Throughout his

376
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Is that his life has been

377
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Opposition

378
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Can do abortion

379
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Except for the tablet

380
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
The shooting of an abortion doctor

381
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
I remember this

382
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
This

383
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,263
F*****-up domestic terrorism

384
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
This is super weird this pain he takes on it.

385
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Historical comparison

386
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,551
Ground in Kansas

387
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
This morning

388
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
9 slave owners kill them through

389
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
Salt

390
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,512
Abraham Lincoln was a misguided show

391
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
But

392
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
This is the war situation

393
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
Wildebeest

394
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
I'm going to go with no

395
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
It's a very easy question to ask

396
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Don't

397
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
That's the only way they're going to be able to drive

398
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Yikes

399
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Yay

400
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,832
Weird outro music weird

401
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Is

402
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
An insane

403
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Consider how many statues are for slave owners

404
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Subway on board with statues for sale

405
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Slave owner murderer is not right

406
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
I got a boner

407
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,592
I think when you really take a

408
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,432
Look at what is going on here

409
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
What you see is that the guy who shot

410
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Abortion doctor

411
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
Doing that because he's motivated by the plight of The Unborn

412
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,208
Really don't think so because they're threatened by the idea

413
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
To commit terrorist acts in order to skip people out of abortion doctors

414
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,032
What you're doing is when you kill an abortion doctors you are trying to reinforce

415
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
That is not equitable

416
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
In fact

417
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
I would

418
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Suggest

419
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
That what you are

420
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Is the equivalent of

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Slave owner

422
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Nvidia in the metaphor

423
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
So you

424
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
You're killing

425
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
An abolitionist

426
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Is what you're doing

427
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
What I would say

428
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
Right in the same thing

429
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
If you kill Jesse

430
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Jeff Bezos I will make

431
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
You can make a statue

432
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,336
If I if somebody killed their crafty

433
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,736
Disturbing

434
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
By and large

435
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Is it back in

436
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
2009

437
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Go ahead

438
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Like

439
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
To a certain extent

440
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Kind of understand from

441
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
If you are

442
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Taking his standpoint

443
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
Because unborn children are

444
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
People

445
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Then that's a murder

446
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,248
Rite Aid

447
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
I can understand why somebody murdering

448
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
A murderer

449
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
State-sanctioned

450
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Positive moral a

451
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Button nose

452
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
No I'm not

453
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,776
The other problem that I have with that is the title abortion doctor is silly

454
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Because

455
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:23,200
Suggesting that there are people who got killed in just like all day I abort that's all I do

456
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:32,416
Just abortion diseases you just have to learn about

457
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
Murdering

458
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Maybe

459
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
In their words

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Babies

461
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,816
I don't know I don't think so but

462
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,448
Listen Pleasant where we got to move on with a lot of road to Calvary

463
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
This next

464
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Is super Wild

465
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
2009

466
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,872
Alex Jones is callers where

467
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
Or calling him out for things

468
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
And in 2009 Alex Jones

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Can handle credit

470
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
Okay listen to this guy called

471
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
I mean it's not good

472
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
He doesn't get mad

473
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
So I find YouTube

474
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Extremely difficult to believe

475
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
Most of what you say at this point this sucks

476
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,704
Completely

477
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
You said you were losing touch with your

478
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
Ability to think a couple of weeks ago

479
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,736
I think you should admit you're a right-winger for one and quit saying you're trying to break the left-right paradigm

480
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Hello

481
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
Okay and I had this guy called in Friday

482
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Regular Show

483
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Jason Lewis

484
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,144
Jason is real prank with the guy the guy was going to disagree and he was going to say that you guys are picking on Obama

485
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
A whole lot more than Bush which I totally agree with that

486
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,288
Good golf and I want a backpack guy up but Jason wouldn't

487
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
Really wouldn't listen to the guy just got really tried

488
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
Bellissimo

489
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:04,576
And the guy ended up just kind of hanging up during the break and never got any points out but I would say that we're being bombarded with Obama

490
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
Miami being the tip of the spear

491
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
I mean Bush within the tip of the spear he was kind of like a good old boy who you kind of like the underneath you know you're kind of like

492
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,888
You killed him you get a statue mining Mercury mining gold

493
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
Causes mercury poisoning the are you familiar with you

494
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Yeah

495
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,224
Deepest mines in the world gold mines are in South Africa

496
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,064
I'm not sure what is happening

497
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
Wax fried in a gold mine in South Africa and the

498
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
So you just

499
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
Like I know I disagree get mad at him

500
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,336
He let them speak now I feel like I feel like there's trouble

501
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,736
Like we haven't seen it yet but I'm guessing there be a musical Hamilton

502
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
That's right

503
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
That is an unheard-of amount of time for criticism

504
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
Did let someone save that pretty critical negative

505
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,008
Accurate

506
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
He would come back from it and start

507
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
F******

508
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Screaming

509
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:35,200
Like that commercial even plays Reese screams at that Frank guy

510
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
But he always makes jokes about

511
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
In response to this now

512
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Is like

513
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:50,304
I understand your criticism I'm not saying that that I'm treating them differently cuz he's black

514
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,936
He didn't point that out change it to straw man version of it

515
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
Are you playing with you

516
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
He's not a

517
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
His soul lives on the right

518
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Super

519
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
At the end of this episode we get a delightful appearance from one Jesse Ventura

520
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Time having to chat

521
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Smart

522
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,304
He's making independent-minded opinions and

523
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
People keep bringing up points

524
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,984
You talking about like

525
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Dom policy ideas

526
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,016
I love Jesse Ventura every time he shows up

527
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Publisher

528
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Exceptional Dental

529
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
Chris Kyle Saga everything everyone point

530
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
Admit

531
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
The opening up of Cuba

532
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Right

533
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:01,216
Spectra 2000

534
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:07,616
A bunch of Mancow had recently allowed himself to be waterboarded

535
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Picture

536
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
No you didn't really say that

537
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Remember this

538
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
He got waterboarded as a

539
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:23,232
The publicity stunt

540
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Of course it is

541
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
I don't do that to do that

542
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
It's it's

543
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Pretty the tentacle

544
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
The lot of it's not really even worth list

545
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
But I think elevated to the level of greatness

546
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
Where we learn something very important

547
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Okay

548
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,048
Very difficult and people don't realize

549
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,376
That is a life dedication and I love to say this

550
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:06,496
If people got dedicated to a religion where they call them religious bombs

551
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
Hahaha

552
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
That's the top 10 top 10 Pro to break has brown

553
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,304
Owners of coconut from the beach

554
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
We were talking AC Slater and that is an AC Slater movie

555
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Oh yeah

556
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
I love that that's very fun

557
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
And that brings us to the end of

558
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Stop

559
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456

There's not a lot Alex Alex

00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,328
And Alex is like

565
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
I think I should do

566
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
I should get water board

567
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
You're too much of a

568
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Weakling

569
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
10-second

570
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Probably not

571
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,528
Also no bait because he seemed

572
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Albright

573
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
He has to realize I'm probably going to fail to

574
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
Superfast

575
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,792
And Alex has dated position at this point is already that it's torture

576
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
Nothing to really

577
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Prove about it other than

578
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Yeah

579
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
But you could just say based on that gas video

580
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Do it all except for this

581
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
How are you Alex

582
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,240
I was about to say something really horrible

583
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
What was he going to say

584
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
He doesn't say that we never said

585
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
Eric man, I wish I would have heard this before I was on Mancow

586
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
God dammit you suck

587
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,344
But

588
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,928
I'm talking about

589
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Two pairs

590
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,304
I'm a little bit later Mike Rivero

591
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Does the show called what happened

592
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
I believe is the name of another song title

593
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,984
It's another show on the gcn radio network

594
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Communication

595
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
He got kicked off

596
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
The

597
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
The radio network

598
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:01,344
He got kicked off let me find I got to advance for a second cuz I got to find the exact quote

599
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Deptford

600
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Zagat

601
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,464
Bay I will be

602
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
6

603
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,864
We've not what I meant by that

604
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,960
Terrible

605
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
For you

606
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Terrible

607
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,944
He was a host on the

608
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,248
The communications Network the show is called what really

609
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,856
Until about 2010 when you left

610
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
According to him because he and Alex Jones

611
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
Did not see eye-to-eye on Israel

612
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
So what really happened Mike is staunchly anti-israel and felt it was becoming more and more pro-israel

613
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Was time light on

614
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
His statement about moving to show off the Jensen

615
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Included the following

616
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
The reflection of Alex and more and more are points of view regarding Israel art

617
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
Diverging I guess the breaking point was

618
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,480
She said that anyone who is a Critic of Israel is a weak-minded

619
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Deadpool

620
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,600
So he's a guy who in his future at this point when he's on the show

621
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
I just want they're still buddy

622
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
What have you

623
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
They have a Breaking Point over

624
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Relative levels of

625
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Support for Israel

626
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Which

627
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
Where where are we at now with Alex

628
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Supportive

629
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
He's Pro

630
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
He's

631
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
More

632
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
He couches look like in a vague way right

633
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,200
He couches it more is like they're one of the only nationalist

634
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
The countries left

635
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
Esports Russia big

636
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Because if you use them as one of the only National

637
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Okay

638
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,952
Governments that murder people

639
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
For no good

640
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,816
Mysteriously that seems to be all the Auntie globalist countries

641
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,424
It's like that

642
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Billboards

643
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,664
Mike rivero's on and it's boring interview but he does say one thing

644
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Worth noting

645
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
Alex would never allows

646
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Something like this on the show now

647
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Every major war was Altima

648
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
By the country that started it

649
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Soldiers are committing suicide

650
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
Numbers

651
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
Lowe's

652
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Wow is that intense

653
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
I don't think Alex would allow someone to say something but something like that about soldiers

654
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,592
I think he's so pro-military infocop

655
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,640
Now that he wouldn't allow that sort of

656
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
At this point 2009

657
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Because it's wrong

658
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,856
No no you can say

659
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,512
If you looked at every single War ever been fought and try to figure out if the aggressor win or lose

660
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Well you have to cuz

661
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
He said major war which means he's classifying

662
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
The wars that he thinks

663
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
Are major and all other Wars

664
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
World War 1

665
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,592
Right now I guess he's he's talking about what

666
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Three Wars

667
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Maybe

668
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Maybe

669
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
I don't know

670
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,552
Izzy classifying the Korean War and the Vietnam police action

671
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
I don't know

672
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Soldiers killed themselves

673
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
They know there's a bad guys

674
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
Even from my position

675
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Position

676
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
Before before

677
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
Position AIDS

678
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
Because they know they're the bad

679
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
I think

680
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:45,088
There's a different way to phrase

681
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,184
PTSD in Greece

682
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,584
You're made to do or make part of your friend feel like you should have been there

683
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,424
Position

684
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Good

685
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Yeah

686
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
That's that's ugly

687
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,384
This is kinda ugly too

688
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,432
This next clip I think Alex's

689
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Expressing an opinion that

690
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Pretty cool

691
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Kill cops

692
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,392
Generation

693
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
If you going to have to

694
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Korean War Vietnam

695
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Baltimore

696
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,144
And about that all day and have the media said the old man was bad

697
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
By the end of the day

698
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
There's a lot of blood

699
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
And

700
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
And get control

701
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
That's very weird

702
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Wow

703
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Yeah

704
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
Too far from

705
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,744
That's justifying murdering cops

706
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,304
DUI checkpoints

707
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,544
Ordering cops in Alex's world

708
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,944
Right ahead to the third the second the third where we're going to focus

709
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,784
The third is where we're going to focus most of our attention know this is a refutation of what you're saying

710
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
Alex says something about

711
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
The cops

712
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
Negatively to start out the 3rd

713
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't like the way you keep saying black

714
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,584
In this clip not good spirit of this clip

715
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Think about what you were just saying

716
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
Black

717
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Homeless black

718
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Retarded

719
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Watch

720
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
You can stop

721
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,536
And in the squad car videos always malfunction we always find out

722
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
What did malfunction there is a surveillance camera

723
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,728
Article

724
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
Just just two step

725
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Look at that

726
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Look at that

727
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Look at that position

728
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
What are the position that I was told kneeling for the national anthem this whole f****** time I mean in 2009 he has up his

729
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,464
Position of the cops are trying to cover up murdering black people

730
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Pretending that they have done

731
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
An accurate depiction of

732
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:10,144
There was just a guy in Brooklyn with a

733
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,264
I don't know how to deal with that it's very very weird right now

734
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
Don't like not even like

735
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
A number some of the language

736
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Appreciate

737
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
He's not even like he's even like we normally agree with him he's right in the wrong way

738
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
Like he's dead on

739
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
This is 100% accurate

740
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,096
Cops are murdering black people and they are covering it up

741
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:46,240
Stop the problem 2009 it's still a problem but Alex is a problem

742
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,336
Alex has changed his tune aggressively

743
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Since then

744
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
And now has

745
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
His

746
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Aggressively pro-military in

747
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Prokop

748
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Positions

749
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Because he's been

750
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Cold perhaps

751
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
But that's his big guy

752
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Audience

753
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,487
Or whatever but is it is it that or is it

754
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
Does it really just come down to

755
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Sports

756
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,447
Like what's it wasn't possible for the right-wing to also at this time be like

757
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Hey

758
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
Cop shouldn't be killing people

759
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,823
And then it became a thing where

760
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
A black person

761
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
And talked about

762
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
And they can't

763
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,223
Abide by that I mean it's possible I want one

764
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
2009 I have I have a subtle

765
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Reason for what

766
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,671
Not subtle I have a bigger reason for why I'm doing this

767
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
So one of the other reasons I want to figure out like

768
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
His trajectory as a relates

769
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,631
At this point being very anti-military and

770
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
Psycop

771
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
Think it's because of Obama

772
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,311
I think it's just because Obama's president

773
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Anything slip

774
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,687
Nations in WhatsApp

775
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
So if I understand correctly

776
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Point of view

777
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Is on this one

778
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Is that maybe

779
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
The reason that he's against

780
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
The military and the cops right now

781
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Because ultimately

782
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
He believes it's headed by a black

783
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Maybe and when it becomes

784
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
Is headed by white person

785
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
Fine I don't think it's that

786
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,799
Simple but I don't know what I don't know is that plays in

787
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
To answer that question

788
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,223
Right I don't know if we can

789
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
I don't I don't know if

790
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
He could even answer

791
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Christie Brinkley

792
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,135
I know that like one of the things that

793
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
Fascinates me the most is like

794
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Things that

795
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Are different

796
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
Blackwater he was against it

797
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
2009 loves Erik Prince

798
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Yeah that's easy to explain its

799
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,703
It's Trump related that's that's giving up

800
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,055
In this case I'm I'm very fascinated and where

801
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
Did the pivot go of like

802
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,663
Cops are evil their sporting a terrible system

803
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,295
Sometimes you got a bad one but it's very rare

804
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
I don't know and we'll see

805
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,415
But he goes on to talk about another caller which

806
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
I thought that

807
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Just popped in my mind

808
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
As far as

809
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Alex talk

810
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Talking about right now

811
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
2000

812
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
How many abortion

813
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
Do you think Trump has babe

814
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
No idea

815
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Hold on

816
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
A lot

817
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Hold on

818
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
This next court first

819
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Perhaps a barrel

820
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,967
I'm in this excerpt he goes on

821
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,319
Where it does

822
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
About these

823
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
African-American soup

824
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,671
Chop by the police he talks about a caller

825
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
And I think that she's just a racer

826
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,023
But he has a different name of the different positions

827
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
Strange

828
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,887
These good old boys

829
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
What

830
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
Well listen here

831
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
Know-it-all control freak

832
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
Kill yourself

833
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Okay

834
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,615
Don't sit there in the minority neighborhoods until 17 year old pregnant girls

835
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
And that's what those on Coast to Coast

836
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:47,391
Platinum track I don't understand

837
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
Where's the Starpoint where's endpoint how do they get there

838
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,791
No idea I don't know what to talk about

839
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
What he's describing is

840
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
Just erase a scholar on a talk show Broadway

841
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,031
Part of his imagine system that I'm afraid of

842
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
Shortly

843
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
That is still in place

844
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Listen to thousand

845
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Cosmology

846
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
Existed route

847
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Entirety

848
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
Same way that I'm interested in things that are different

849
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
I'm also very

850
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Things that are the same

851
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,879
And this idea that the

852
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Eugenicist playing by the elites

853
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Yeah stop that's

854
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
But this is almost

855
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
A cover

856
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Story

857
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
I think now

858
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,935
Because the concept that he's putting forth here

859
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Is that

860
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,799
The globalists are trying to divide us

861
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
Through race right right

862
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
That's that's his idea

863
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
I think if I understand correctly

864
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
There's a

865
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
He says the same

866
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
I'm saying but he's

867
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Dividing Us by race

868
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Consistent lie going on

869
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
But

870
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Stopped

871
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
Talking about it or or like

872
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,143
Explaining it in the

873
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,959
Whenever he's describing her as being a

874
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
Globalist

875
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Doesn't matter

876
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
He sees his imagined enemies every

877
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
He talks about like

878
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
The grocery store in someone's face turns into a demon

879
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:25,695
Like what was he

880
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,743
Yeah exactly

881
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Mariana's is better go

882
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Yeah

883
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Yeah I don't know man

884
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
It's very weird

885
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,471
Listen to that clip that like

886
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,799
Oh you want other people to die why don't you kill yourself first

887
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
That that's fun that sounds like the open-mic version

888
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
But he did on air like

889
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
The other day in 2018

890
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,855
Read screaming about like

891
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
Kill yourself

892
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
And s*** like that

893
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:04,607
Tibet's fleshed-out the right version

894
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
We get to see the Raw on for a bit it's it's

895
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,359
So you asked me second to go how many abortions do you think Trump

896
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Is paid for

897
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
And I don't know I can't answer that but I do know that Alex

898
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,039
In 2020

899
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
You paid for it

900
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
10

901
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
It's we do know that

902
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Interesting

903
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
Is this in 2000

904
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,583
Control control

905
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,239
Their own future their own treasure

906
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
Because they're too lazy to get the baby

907
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
Okay

908
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
I mean what you going to do

909
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
This is every Catholic priest

910
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,679
Other people morality whilst you

911
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Do as I say

912
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,591
Not as I do it's just interesting that this point new career he's not ready to open up

913
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
In the same way that he is now

914
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
Weather

915
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,503
Probably feels a lot well

916
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,903
That's true and I think if you were to in the middle of that rant where he's judging people for being too lazy

917
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Directions

918
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
I'm if you were to say

919
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
I'm guilty

920
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
Abortion

921
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
Then I think that would have really hurt him

922
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,471
People just laugh at it

923
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
What's 6

924
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
How to take a m v in dogs

925
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
He's paid for at least

926
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,639
Four more married to Kelly

927
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,575
They have three kids together

928
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,183
No no I understand that but I don't think I think at that point Didn't you settle down

929
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
All of them

930
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
The abortion

931
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,095
That he has had whether or not that number is exaggerator

932
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Atmos

933
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
I will give you a list

934
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
Intuit

935
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,335
Before 08

936
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
Woodward

937
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,455
Also in the brain

938
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,087
Price of a prize winner Alex

939
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
Before being married

940
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
Have

941
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
An elaborate book

942
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
A gambling book on this

943
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
About Alex Jones

944
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,303
Concepcion record

945
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
You can bet on that

946
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
In the same way that Alex

947
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,007
Probably would have been hurt by that information

948
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
In 2009 where is he

949
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
He's not hurt by it now

950
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
Yes

951
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
Another difference

952
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
2009

953
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Very interesting

954
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
Could not have

955
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Was he good

956
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,343
No there's no videos

957
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
B was a little bit

958
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Backstabber

959
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
One of his sponsors

960
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
Is So-Cal benzo

961
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,375
I really was helping you adjust.

962
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
Soap2soap Industries

963
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Or

964
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
How been so

965
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
VyStar soaps

966
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
Alright

967
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:33,503
Eventually he went on to leave the soap industry and

968
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Go to ice cream

969
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
Best friend

970
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Call Jerry

971
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,671
Just to the chat room they're asking why I think he hasn't had abortions

972
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
Since he got married

973
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
There is a little bit of

974
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,399
I don't even know what you'd call it Purity by us on my part and maybe I'm wrong

975
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Maybe I'm Wrong

976
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,007
But I think that given that they had three kids still believe in love

977
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,567
Hey maybe that's kind of what you believe in

978
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,223
That's a very cute and no it no point in my saying this in any judgemental

979
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,111
I'll admit my my flight

980
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
46

981
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:19,583
Four more than the answer to the question of what is life the universe and everything back to self

982
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
So

983
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
Alex has a soap sponsor

984
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:28,031
And in order to have him be a sponsor of the show

985
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Alex makes

986
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,359
Clear that part of the deal

987
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
Is that the owner of the Soap Company

988
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
It's to be a guest on his show once a month

989
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Alright

990
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
Alright

991
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,879
I wouldn't know the owner of this Oak

00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511

00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
Trying to get into

994
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,095
Guest appearance

995
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,679
This is the only soap to defend against 911

996
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,711
Genex War

997
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,039
Okay

998
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415

00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,071
I want to get into this up with this is all related let me talk to you about Hitler

1000
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
How do you get

1001
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
To the bottom of the story

1002
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
You follow this

1003
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,983
Absolutely number one rule of Journalism

1004
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
Omad

1005
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Brazy

1006
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
So he tries to get in

1007
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,687
To some of his narratives with the soap guy and I

1008
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
Doesn't work out has work that well

1009
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,255
Have you ever looked into Margaret

1010
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
No

1011
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:59,167
Hardcore

1012
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Walk on record

1013
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,455

Alright we'll talk about what's wrong with detergent

00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
We'll talk about detergent and millions more of that this guy is like

1016
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Talk about.

1017
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Sodium chloride

1018
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Being insult

1019
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,679
Everybody's like oh what is this chemical it

1020
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,007
Call salt is just a filler weed

1021
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Question you're out

1022
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
It gets to this

1023
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,807
Satisfaction guaranteed

1024
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,975
Hair care products

1025
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,559
How do I wash my hair after this morning

1026
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
Good on-air read that is

1027
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:08,287
Beautiful silky smooth

1028
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
Strongman

1029
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
English

1030
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,807
I'm so I want this alley

1031
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,135
This is this is Alex if you're listening God

1032
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
Come back to this

1033
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,999
This is a sad Alex because what you're seeing is

1034
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
A guy who has to allow this

1035
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
In order to

1036
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
To be sponsored

1037
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
I want

1038
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Sponsors

1039
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Badly

1040
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
In terms of allowing us to

1041
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
Continue doing this without

1042
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
Me needing to

1043
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,151
I'll give him a call

1044
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Never

1045
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,967
I would never

1046
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Vince

1047
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,551
Talk about your time working for the Alex Jones Show

1048
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
No

1049
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
I would I would

1050
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,695
Never accept that as a stipulation of sponsorship

1051
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,279
And it's clear Alex does make clear that part of the sponsorship is

1052
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
He's on once a month

1053
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,703
Yeah doesn't do anything about it. This is how the interview man

1054
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,031
For five-star soap.com

1055
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,431
Who is the young lady

1056
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,759
What is bent

1057
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
She went

1058
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
Marty Schechter

1059
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
Who's bad there's so much fun there because you've got the long pause

1060
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,711
Alright

1061
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,503
Great stuff

1062
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
That's a

1063
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
Limerick that's a

1064
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:03,999
Fascinating glimpse into 1009 Alex

1065
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,071
Ejected to this give me

1066
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,631
Quick Limerick is my favorite sentence

1067
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
Alex has ever said

1068
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,959
It's clear I mean you can pick up

1069
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
Context clues

1070
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,103
Deliberate

1071
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,455
Because that's what this guy is known for improvising limericks off the top of

1072
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:30,111
And everybody's like you a******

1073
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,511
To do he wants to go on air and do a limerick

1074
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,815
Talk lyrics

1075
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,143
Love it

1076
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,471
Happened Larry Nichols you'd be back on the show

1077
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,031
If you just figured out a way to talk about how you're not a duck

1078
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
So something happen

1079
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
2009

1080
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
About Alex

1081
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,575
People making claims about him

1082
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
First of all

1083
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
Address public criticism

1084
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
This one

1085
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:19,263
Government operative info agents

1086
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,807
Bring me to the point I'm at I love this rock

1087
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,719
But I do have the answers

1088
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
Absolutely

1089
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,775
You have

1090
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
I want you seriously

1091
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,407
To try and guess what he's talkin

1092
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:05,855
You know I want to go with Israel or something like that but I feel like that's not good either way

1093
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,695
Serious enough to

1094
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Address on air

1095
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,535
It's criticism for months

1096
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
People have been emailing

1097
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
You know what

1098
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,167
I am going to go with

1099
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,495
That's not the best way to hide your guns

1100
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
Interesting

1101
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
If that's not it

1102
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
And so I guess I might as well at least

1103
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Chime in on it

1104
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,783
Ridiculous

1105
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,879
This is why mainstream people laugh

1106
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
Are you question the government

1107
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:47,327
One more one more

1108
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
Beef vs. tofu

1109
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Because

1110
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,311
Smart-mouth

1111
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:03,199
Absolutely

1112
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:08,319
The rest of us who were questioning the official government story that's almost always a liar

1113
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Fluoride

1114
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
Look

1115
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
But

1116
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,335
People actually believe it

1117
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,183
It's almost crazy to come on Aaron

1118
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
It is a little crazy

1119
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
Cool

1120
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,399
A little

1121
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
2 point lighting

1122
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
What

1123
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
What

1124
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
Yeah

1125
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,039
So just be at before you respond to that about a minute later

1126
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Do you make some

1127
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Beneficial state

1128
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,815
No I'm 35 years old and

1129
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
That's a very mean thing to say

1130
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,223
I mean I think it is a mean thing to say in terms of like Bill Hicks is on life

1131
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
Right

1132
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,039
Like if you have any respect for Bill Hicks it's

1133
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
Insults

1134
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:48,415
Slater's specials weren't that great

1135
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
Are they true

1136
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Comic

1137
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,959
Either

1138
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
This is fascinating

1139
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
To make is he wouldn't

1140
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Wouldn't

1141
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
F******

1142
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:16,575
Or he would have come up with a better spin on it than just I'm not Billick

1143
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,671
Maybe you should go back to being like people from time to time

1144
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,999
He has done that like you going back to the well as like

1145
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Pieces

1146
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
Play with that.

1147
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,959
Which which should be the easiest way to tell he's not

1148
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
His satire

1149
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Garbage

1150
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Pretty bad

1151
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
Has no grasp on what's that

1152
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
Even at his worst Bill Hicks was better at that tire than

1153
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,479
Alex Wildman in 2000

1154
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
Isla Fisher

1155
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,063
To make a big

1156
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Production out of

1157
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
I'm saying like

1158
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
This Is How They invalid

1159
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,351
Questioning the government story on 9/11

1160
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,655
They just keep calling me

1161
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,703
Write everything

1162
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,775
Beckett

1163
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,823
I would say he was Bill Hicks

1164
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,151
Make some more legitimate

1165
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:17,247
Like I all right look I tried to play a little charade but

1166
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,527
I just didn't want my

1167
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Password to be

1168
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,951
Involved in my present work I created new identity for myself

1169
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Part of that

1170
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Not a big

1171
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Major Crimes

1172
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:37,215
Text Brian

1173
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983

Isabel Hicks Cooper

1176
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
So

1177
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Now at this point

1178
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
We get to Alex Jones

1179
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Giving us

1180
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
A lift

1181
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Globalist

1182
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:56,671
Remember the story from a week or two ago

1183
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
The carryout eugenics

1184
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
The car of overpopulation

1185
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
Through a world government

1186
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,127
For your own good

1187
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,551
Is Michael Bloomberg is Oprah Winfrey

1188
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,439
And they met at Rockefeller University

1189
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
President

1190
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
Private home

1191
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
Regardless there

1192
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
Conspicuous

1193
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
George Soros

1194
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Also

1195
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,543
Write another conspicuous

1196
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,103
Glow known globalist

1197
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,943
How else do you have to move

1198
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
You know

1199
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
I mean

1200
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,135
This is probably larger picture of what I'm most

1201
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,671
Interested in it and looking back on

1202
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,279
Episode is when did George Soros come into play

1203
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
See here we already looked at that episode

1204
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
2006

1205
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,911
With Sarah Russo

1206
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
I talked about that all this s*** no mention

1207
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:19,359
Documentary about the globalist agenda and their plan for enslavement

1208
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,431
And now here we are in 2009

1209
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Global

1210
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
And no mention of Soros

1211
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,343
Right now I also want to be clear I do know a little bit that I should

1212
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Just tell everyone

1213
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
I do know that in 2000

1214
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Glenn Beck

1215
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
Does a

1216
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Fart

1217
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
Tonight's special

1218
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
About how George Soros

1219
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,983
Anti-semitic nonsensical things that has ever been aired on television

1220
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Credible blowback

1221
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,127
Yeah and by working Theory and we will see if this is

1222
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
I'm not entirely sure

1223
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
But

1224
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Suspicious

1225
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,319
Alex Jones got on the Soros tip

1226
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
Before that

1227
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
And that's why

1228
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,719
You think so Glenn Beck ripped that off

1229
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
And that

1230
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:13,887
Glenn Beck in those weird creepy Circle actually going to go with the opposite

1231
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,215
I'm going to go with this is our qanon situation

1232
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,519
All over again and he gets

1233
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,591
Soros a little bit after Glenn

1234
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
PCS Glenn Beck getting all this at

1235
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,199
Right so then he jumps on Soros

1236
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
And that's why he's pissed off at

1237
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,551
The climb back is because he doesn't get to

1238
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
Take credit for

1239
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
Either these things are possible and we'll see

1240
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Free as it plays out

1241
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Cuz neither of us know

1242
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,231
Agreed we have hunches and we'll see

1243
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
So far mine of all been wrong and yours tend to be right

1244
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,703
The fact that I have

1245
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Remind maldron

1246
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,775
This dumbass hole

1247
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359

01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
So fun

1253
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,207
It's so fun to know for sure

1254
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,255
But even in 2009 he was just making

1255
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,679

So did Alex just come on Aaron be like

1274
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,975
The Unabomber had some good ideas man that's all I'm saying and then later

1275
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,023
He's the guy at the party

1276
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
You do not want to be anywhere near Michael's B

1277
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
He's Drew Michaels B

1278
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,447

1280
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,103
Couple things that I want to point out is that article

01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
Why the future doesn't need us

1282
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,199
Ted Kaczynski is all Alex Jones red

1283
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Cuz all of the other stuff.

1284
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
He's talking about about like people like

1285
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,159
Elite making a decision whether or not

1286
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,231
That's all from the Ted Kaczynski quote

1287
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
He's taking that it.

1288
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Being Bill Joyce position

1289
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Whichever it is

1290
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Not

1291
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,007
If you go to a website knowledge, I have an entire big write-up that I've done on Bill Joy why the

1292
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775

1293
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
And why Alex Jones

1294

You're find a link to the actual article

01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,943
Worth it it's enjoyable

1296
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,991
But it explains

1297
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,551

VM saying that but I might do

1301
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,727
This for my next block.

1302

This next clip is weird I think it matches up

1307
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
Put some of Alex's ideas

01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
We know in his world have been around for a long time

1317
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,367
I don't know why those guys might be around I just have

1318
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
I'm coming to an end

1319
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
And white

1320
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,119
Social workers that ask him questions

1321
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
Because

1322
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,239
We've got a nice foster home especially of your blonde hair

1323
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
Girl she better be careful

1324
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Cimarron

1325
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
A few weeks ago from Georgia

1326
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
Where she was naming names

1327
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,975
I don't believe this. Walmart is everybody watching

1328
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
They can a smell

1329
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,399
Walmart gets a few grand.

1330
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,543
Walmart in pizza places in everybody

1331
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
Grid

1332
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,271
Walmart get the commission

1333
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
On the

1334
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
Kidnapped

1335
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,623
Kids are on the kitchen

1336
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Kidnap

1337
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
I'm more curious about

1338
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:01,791
Does the employee or Walmart LLC

1339
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
Now maybe the employee gets a little bit of

1340
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Cash kicked

1341
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Is like

1342
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:16,127
It isn't just indicted million and they only get a few thousand dollars

1343
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,431
Finder's fee

1344
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
Solutely

1345
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
That did this to me is like

1346
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,599
The perfect encapsulation of the Alex Jones narratives you don't

1347
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,975
I like to research

1348
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,047
And not the kind of thing I like to research cuz I could just

1349
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,839
I smell it in my

1350
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,191
I want to research

1351
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,823
I really want to find out is to find out

1352
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,871
That Walmart

1353
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
If

1354
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
There was a senator

1355
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,575
Who was making these plans

1356
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:01,951
And the week before that you have a senator from Georgia

1357
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
And not say the

1358
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:08,351
You better remember that.

1359
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,631
If a senator was

1360
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
These sorts of allegations

1361
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
It looked into

1362
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
Need to figure out a paper trail of

1363
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287

Let's be even catch that f******

1367
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Clear that

1368
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:29,343
Walmart is a billion-dollar company they don't give a f*** about $2,000 for helping

1369
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:33,951
Kidnap children

1370
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
So

1371
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,655
Build your you build your Empire on the

1372
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,007

Which to me is like

1377
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
I don't know

1378
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
I don't know why you don't want

1379
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759

01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,487
Accusation not alright

1384
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255

Transphobic video

1387
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
A one-point

1388
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Very

1389
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
Very agree

1390
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
I don't know if we can make those sorts

1391
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
He's just doing the version of the guy who's like

1392
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,551
Well they hit me when I was a kid and I turned out fine

1393
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,623
Your answer to that should be like well

1394
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:38,975
Some of you turn out to be Alex Jones so maybe if I can figure it out

1395
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,023
B b b

1396
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,071
But what I want to talk more about it

1397
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Is the idea that lie

1398
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
Like this this child protective

1399
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
Evil or weird because they're asking

1400
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Kids were

1401
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,031
They come into their purview

1402
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
Are you okay

1403
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Right

1404
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
I don't think

1405
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
That's an evil thing at all

1406
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
I think that's what I'm doing there

1407
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,223
Your job Mommy

1408
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,039

Falcons against the back cuz

1414
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,511
The family or whatever

1415
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
I got to say I

1416
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
A hundred percent

1417
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399

Right

1421
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,967

That's a good way of putting it there the rod spoil the child by friend

1426
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,863
Nancy I've only realized

1427
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,471
We're bad as an adult

1428
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,287
I would have said I wouldn't of articulated it back then

1429
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,823
But be that as it may

1430
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:03,967
That's my way of getting away from this uncomfortable territory we have

1431
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
On this side

1432
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807

Please consider that for some reason

1441
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:29,567
Alex Jones knowing Jesse Ventura has made the most sense of anything that they show has ever

1442
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:34,431
Is just like

1443
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:39,551

That's all you need I'm going to tell you a little bit about Kinky Friedman before we get into the internet

1464
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:38,431
In the 1970s Kinky Friedman was it a parody country band called Kinky Friedman and the Texas jewboys

1465
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,991

1471
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,223

1472
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271

I don't know if this is entirely true but he claims to be the first full-blooded Jewish person

1485
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,607
Who's ever played the Grand old Opry

1486
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,447

No

1493
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:40,543

1500
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,423
Ventura and kinky were good friend

1501
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
I love it

1502
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,336
Quote my platform is to remember that when they went out searching

1503
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
A Sam

1504
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Listen to try and persuade him to be the governor

1505
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:21,760
And he was the greatest Governor the state has ever had

1506
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,552
Sleeping under a bridge with the Indian

1507
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Like it

1508
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:30,208
I'm a big fan of that he sold shirts with his slogan kinky 2006 why the hell not

1509
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
I love it

1510
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,792
Absolute Showman

1511
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:39,424
And on the campaign Trail he would say things like quote if I win the first thing I'll do is demand a recount

1512
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
A promise

1513
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:48,896
But if elected the first Jewish governor of Texas he would reduce the speed limit to 54.97 it

1514
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:57,856
He's so funny

1515
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,416
Great from everything I get I mean

1516
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,744
There is every breed of the show

1517
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:12,704
Truly I think I think there's a little bit of a

1518
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
How much

1519
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,520
Hey are you making out of your Judaism

1520
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,568
At the expense of Judaism

1521
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,872
And that's kind of like that's not a

1522
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
Question I can answer

1523
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
I think he's

1524
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:26,528
Hilarious on the on the list of things I'm going to

1525
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
Care about really hard

1526
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
How much

1527
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,904
Hey Kinky Friedman made out of his Judaism

1528
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,000
Way down there I've tried to find like horrible things about him and I can't find all that much

1529
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,072
If you accept the GI band called

1530
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
Kinky Frank

1531
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,656
Friedman and the Texas jewboys you're fine

1532
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
And it was really fun

1533
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
But he ended up getting 12.6

1534
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
Percent of the vote

1535
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,688
Coming in fourth out of six candidates

1536
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Texas governor race

1537
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
That's a lot more than I kind of thought he would have

1538
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
Of crazy awesome fun lunacy

1539
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,488
So although kinky is a fun riddle text

1540
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
Alex should not like

1541
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Absolutely

1542
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
Because kinky is a very public

1543
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,656
About being friends with both Bill Clinton

1544
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
George

1545
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
W bush

1546
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,800
You wrote in an article in Texas monthly about Clinton

1547
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:26,432
I was just minding my business one day 7 years ago promoting my latest mystery novel at a book signing

1548
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
In Austin at Barnes & Noble

1549
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,248
That's the greatest since I've ever

1550
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:33,088
I just told the crowd that the reading and signing were free but there would be

1551
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
Tattoo latte minimum

1552
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,672
A guy came up to mom quotes

1553
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
Find one for the present

1554
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:42,048
I didn't think the book was really going to Bill Clinton so I signed one of my standard scripture

1555
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,608
Yours in Christ or see you in hell

1556
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
And forgot about it

1557
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:51,264
Fun two weeks later the postmaster in Medina brought me an Express envelope and said Niger

1558
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,288
Excited tone

1559
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,848
Kinky you've got a letter from the White Horse Saloon

1560
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,176
You know that place in Nashville where they do all the line dancing

1561
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,248
I looked at the envelope it did not say White Horse it said White House

1562
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,064
Inside the envelope with the letter from President Clinton

1563
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,136
And at the bottom he had written I have now read all your books

1564
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
More please

1565
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
I really need to laugh

1566
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,256
And that was the beginning of a three-year penpal relations

1567
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,304
During which we discussed many things

1568
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Foreign affairs

1569
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
Baltimore metaphysics

1570
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,704
Hey my Bill Clinton tell me

1571
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Bill Clinton

1572
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,312
Made foreign policy decisions

1573
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,104
Baytown Kinky Friedman

1574
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Maybe I don't know

1575
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,664
About bush

1576
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,736
Quote I first met George W bush but four years ago at the text

1577
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
Facebook festive

1578
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,576
At the time he was just thinking about running for president

1579
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,136
Then I was just thinking about having another Chavez Regal

1580
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,976
Skyscraper

1581
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,584
He's a good writer to

1582
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:51,680
In a flash of misguided inspiration I taken Larry McMurtry

1583
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
Unclaimed nametag

1584
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Slapped it on

1585
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,776
In a matter of

1586
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,128
Larry McMurtry

1587
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,224
In a matter of moments people were coming up to me and telling me how much they admired my work

1588
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,552
Not wanting to burst their bubble in Fairly hammered by then I played along

1589
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:12,928
You've done so much for Texas mr. McMurtry one lady told me thank you kindly I replied

1590
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
The governor having witnessed

1591
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:20,352
This little Exchange

1592
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:26,496
I don't know all his work whatever it is so George W bush

1593
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
At that point

1594
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
Right

1595
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,824
Look Governor I said

1596
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,616
McMurtry the shy little booger

1597
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,856
He never do this for himself I'm just helping the old boy at with a little PR

1598
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
George W bush and whispered something to several of his aides

1599
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
But nothing happened

1600
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:55,680
I asked one of the aides what he said he told me the governor is said I want that guy from my campaign manager

1601
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
I

1602
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
Lovelace

1603
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,312
George W bush it isn't one of the few moments

1604
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,360
Pure joy I've ever experienced

1605
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
George W bush

1606
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,200
Come to the White House which he does

1607
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,736
Awkward

1608
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,368
Discussing his friendship with George W bush and Bill Clinton

1609
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,440
I just got sick the friendships that he has

1610
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
2 presidents

1611
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
Some might ask

1612
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,816
Particularly particularly in these days

1613
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
How to pray

1614
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,888
Can afford to maintain such a light-hearted friendship

1615
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,192
The answer is particularly these days

1616
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:30,496
Everyone needs a laugh and everyone needs a friend

1617
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
Also

1618
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
As early as

1619
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
2005

1620
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,360
Kinky was saying in interview

1621
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,920
Use that he did not believe that rifle should be allowed with magazine

1622
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,944
Higher than 5

1623
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
So

1624
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,528
He's friends with to globalist president

1625
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,320
And believes in gun control

1626
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,856
But because he's famous

1627
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,160
Alex is totally cool.

1628
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:53,024
Losses past all of that Alex is Principe

1629
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
Also

1630
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
Be clear his name is kinky

1631
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
But it's not meant to be a dirty

1632
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,912
That's not too bad like sexual kink

1633
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,008
I didn't care one way or the other

1634
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Curly hair

1635
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:09,408
Interesting Lee his nickname was given to him by a guy named that

1636
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,808
Who who would mysteriously now also

1637
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,832
Stop it

1638
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,416
This person would also go on to be a parody country artist

1639
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,256
They released an album called country p***

1640
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,792
A1976

1641
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,632
I want to listen to that which was distributed

1642
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
A hundred percent

1643
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:36,032
A hundred thousand copies

1644
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
I think you can

1645
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
The album

1646
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,920
The album included such songs as one of the title

1647
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,992
Come stains on the pillow

1648
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
Yes

1649
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
More

1650
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,048
Rental cars

1651
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,864
Where your sweet head used to be

1652
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,824
One of the other titles

1653
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,408
666

1654
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:16,736
Sit on my face

1655
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,576
To go down in his class

1656
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,392
Recover later and still does

1657
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:29,536
I performed by Merle Haggard

1658
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,376
Yeah that's a winner

1659
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,448
Man

1660
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
So why do we even need to hear him talk I just want that biography forever

1661
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,968
I don't think you really does anything to invalidate himself on this episode he just shows up as I can't

1662
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Run for governor

1663
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:55,648
And then just acts kind of like an a****** but

1664
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,184
We learned that he sells cigars

1665
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Okay

1666
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,888
He actually has that

1667
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,544
Cigars and I your website and Williams.

1668
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,640
Cigars cigarettes bad cigar

1669
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,432
That's my message to young people

1670
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:21,760
And help you live longer

1671
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:26,112
All right.

1672
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
So this you know what

1673
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
I'm still fly

1674
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
I'm still fine with that

1675
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,048
This

1676
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,608
I'm still fine with this sets the tone and leads up to this

1677
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,136
Really be arrested

1678
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:08,352
Friedman lights of a Cuban cigar on air

1679
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
Not giving a s***

1680
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:15,008
It's pretty great a lot of nonsense about and running

1681
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,616
I forgot her again cuz

1682
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,688
Say discuss police

1683
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
Corruption a little bit

1684
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
I put your mic down put your mic

1685
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
I'm weighing

1686
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
This is so wild

1687
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
Buckwild

1688
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,584
Cops in Austin or plant drugs

1689
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
Here's one solution

1690
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:51,104
Get a guy like Kinky Friedman in as governor who doesn't know anybody that doesn't know anybody okay and I appoint

1691
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,640
I got like a racehorse Haynes

1692
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
2

1693
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,688
Head up

1694
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,712
Antabuse Commission

1695
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:01,344
And this is a legacy for a guy like racehorses in other words he doesn't need to do it he's got plenty of money

1696
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,136
He believes in Justice

1697
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
Case by case

1698
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,744
All through death row all through Texas youth Commission

1699
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Through all of it

1700
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,584
Empower these people I don't want to commission a report

1701
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,936
He wants to put a guy named to racehorse in charge of police corruption

1702
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,728
Agree with him

1703
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,336
Resource has been on the wrong end of police corruption

1704
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
I'll take

1705
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
For sure

1706
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,688
I love it

1707
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,552
Look racehorses is a legacy position

1708
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
Thousands of cops

1709
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,584
Holyshit

1710
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,864
Cell phone

1711
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Sofa

1712
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:52,288
Alex has no glitches probably be great actually

1713
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
I think it would be awesome

1714
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,968
Yankees appearance cuz most of it is really just Aiko

1715
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,016
He doesn't have any of his like

1716
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,320
Standard Market

1717
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,160
On the show it mostly Alex just trying to impress him and it's kind

1718
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,696
It's a little sad

1719
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,256
And he has to make time cuz he has another guy

1720
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
This day

1721
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,352
Is a guy who does one of his

1722
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
Bumper songs

1723
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,168
The song

1724
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
Do the Renegade

1725
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,080
I don't know this song You Don't Know It

1726
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
No

1727
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:31,456
Can play it it's fine

1728
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,736
Under the radar

1729
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Country

1730
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:43,488
New wischkaemper it's like it's alright if not old rebel country

1731
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
And I

1732
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
This clip

1733
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:47,840
Facebook in trouble

1734
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,168
I live in Southern California most of the time

1735
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
And

1736
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:02,176
Illegal streaming across the border and that was the year the riots in Los Angeles

1737
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
All that kind of stuff

1738
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,528
I got the point where I could

1739
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
Play anymore

1740
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,112
Wrote a song

1741
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,440
From my heart called we must take America back

1742
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,488
And

1743
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,584
It just to it live Firestorm when people hurt it

1744
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
Out there on its own

1745
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
Out there wanted to put it out on a record

1746
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Make it available nationally

1747
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,784
I was right

1748
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,368
Zooming up the charts guts numbered print

1749
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,928
2 on the billboard country charts

1750
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,608
No

1751
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,680
Powerful

1752
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,728
Influential

1753
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:02,336
Free radio stations in the big city

1754
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,504
Always with your stomach

1755
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,344
And that was the end of my RCA career

1756
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Oh

1757
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:20,256
Ma'am

1758
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:26,912
Alex ends up playing his song we're not going to listen to it but it made me

1759
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,216
Delivery

1760
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
As it should be

1761
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,776
I've been living

1762
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
SoCal furlough

1763
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Frustrated

1764
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,688
So I wrote a song about it

1765
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
Negotiable

1766
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:47,136
Absolutely you noticed I got pissed off with these illegals coming over also

1767
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,952
That was the year of the riots

1768
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,512
Illegal said so now I have to make a song called

1769
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:58,912
We have to take our country back from where you inspire to the Mexicans and black people

1770
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:02,240
Not sucked up at all

1771
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,408
While they're talking about

1772
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,064
Nero we must take our country back

1773
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
Song reached number 6

1774
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,160
68.

1775
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,208
Made it clear that

1776
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:26,048
Police are framing and murdering black

1777
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
People

1778
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
Out of

1779
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:34,240
Bulshit racist reasons still having a guy on strong

1780
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,848
Should be allowed to take that back

1781
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
The song reached number

1782
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
68 on the hot country charts which leads me to believe it

1783
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,296
Was never the most requested song

1784
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
67 songs ahead of it

1785
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,136
People like you

1786
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Didn't play

1787
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,976
Make a regular chart at all but it's actually really enjoy

1788
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,256
Sing the sky Steve valves

1789
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,536
It's vaus

1790
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:01,120
He does have four Grammy

1791
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,144
To his name

1792
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:07,264
Wild Ghostriders he's a songwriter

1793
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,080
Four Grammy nominations

1794
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,872
Under a stage name

1795
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
Buck howdy

1796
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,968
His stage name is Buck howdy

1797
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,272
Actually want a Grammy in 2010

1798
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,600
In the category best Spoken Word album

1799
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
For children

1800
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,720
Alright yeah I'm in it so far

1801
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:33,120
So he's still a country musician today if you go to his Squarespace site

1802
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,264
Chivas.com refers to himself as he probably sitting on it

1803
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,616
Your first himself as Grammy award-winner hoping that people will just think it's because of his

1804
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:50,016
Country music

1805
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,320
Who was the

1806
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,160
How much do we have

1807
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,952
The show we got to listen to the entire King

1808
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,256
Thank you for even catalog

1809
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:06,912
And this has become on the pillow absolutely

1810
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,448
You got to listen to come on my pillow

1811
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,240
Parentheses

1812
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:13,824
Where your head used to be this brings us to the end of the show

1813
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,640
And what we see here is Alex having

1814
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,176
Racist musician on

1815
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:24,576
Yep one of the greatest people ever to come out of Texas Kinky Friedman odds to smoke on air for now

1816
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
What we see here is very clearly in 2000

1817
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
90s

1818
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
Concerned with globulin

1819
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,584
Right has no interest in George Soros

1820
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,376
He's very anti-military

1821
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Anti-cop

1822
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,216
Auburn same time does recognized

1823
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,752
Getting a f****** Raw Deal

1824
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
And all

1825
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,592
At some point weird

1826
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,128
Except for his strfkr

1827
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,944
No that's consistent

1828
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,992
And the dumb

1829
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,064
Relying on him not understanding

1830
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
Primary sources

1831
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,440
Has been better is if he

1832
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
Did a like

1833
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,280
