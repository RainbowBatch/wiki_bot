1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge babe I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Brown's little bit about Alex

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
June

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Again.

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,936
Quick question

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
Who are you

10
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Put a new cover art on the on the show This Is Us

11
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,160
Kyle back by a guy named Jackie

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
Yeah set this design

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Cuz I really like that and

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,888
Don't think about the freshening things up and that you know is our anniversary for the show and I felt like

15
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Timing is perfect

16
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,056
I figured out what I've been doing wrong in terms of why are like a really old

17
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah cover art was showing up in like apple podcast

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
I'd size but at the image wrong it turns out

19
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
Apple podcast

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Except so I figured like

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Bucket list

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
One Fell Swoop

23
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,304
Thanks to Jack that the image is really great and I appreciate that.

24
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,656
I love looking at it as well defined in there

25
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
That's really great

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
Confuse baby pink guitar

27
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
That's a deep cut

28
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,920
Stroope yeah we will not explain it

29
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,832
What about what about you

30
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Okay

31
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
Garbodor really really terrible

32
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
There's one moment in the film where

33
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Part of the reason is bad is it

34
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
Incomprehensible and what's comprehensible

35
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
Incredibly stupid about their backstory her journal

36
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
Yeah yeah so apparently one of the deviants

37
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Slowly there supposed to be this race is Monster bad and the Eternal Spider-Man bye-bye you know the whole deal

38
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
So one of them gain sentience

39
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Right

40
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
And slowly starts to think and feel and has

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
I thought after absorbing one of these dudes

42
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Alright

43
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
So

44
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,000
They find out that the god that created them both as really just been

45
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Like playing

46
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Ants

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
And putting them in making them fight this whole time

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Right

49
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
So the guy that came sentience is like hey

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
F*** this noise let's team up

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,104
And go after the real guy we're just Pawns in his dumb game where is the people who were victims here

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Both of us you and me right now

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Murder this guy who just gained sentience and was 100% correct about everything

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Because the only good guy in this movie was murdered immediately

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,192
The sensible and Eros my brakes

56
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
I think it was an unintended

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
Microcosm of the Marvel machine

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
You know like

59
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
The one bright spot that said listen

60
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
We can break through of this

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Goddamn Orthodox storytelling method

62
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
This is all made up

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
We're just fighting for no reason we got it changed

64
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
Is like that means you nailed it

65
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
I'm glad that you dug deep and found some so meaning in that movie I did I do not seen its when I say I heard it's bad I'm just

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Get off

67
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Gimp ass real bad

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,031
Jordan today we have to go back into the past

69
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
About 2,300 take AAA separate

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Journey

71
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
Today cuz I

72
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
I was thinking about it really I don't want to

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Luck and talk more about the same

74
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Stupid

75
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Spirit like the covid

76
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Conspiracies and I don't want to talk

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
About like

78
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,487
James O'Keefe project Veritas put out of video I don't want to hear about it

79
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
Rand Paul got into a little fight with the fauci

80
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,655
I don't care in me off Alex probably going to have a fit

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
I don't care

82
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
So I just was like the present day I gotta let it let it simmer for a little bit better then on Monday the

83
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Who's the most important person in the world

84
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
We can about it up if we can't follow it up

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,807
So I need to go back to the past an Excursion based on

86
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Some

87
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Things that I've stumbled across

88
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
Online I want to explore some ideas that I had about them

89
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
But before we get done

90
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Business

91
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
Like you and hello doesn't do walks

92
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
The worst candy and ends this thank you so much and I'll probably walk

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
I am now the Scout walk

94
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,967
Keon the trisexual and being thank you so much

95
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm a policy against the common Florida berbagai thank you so much you are now policy walk

96
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Thank you very much do wonders if you ever cross paths with the movie theaters

97
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,863
Columbia Missouri in the mid and late 2000s thank you so much you're now a policy wonk

98
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Hey there's a

99
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Decent chance

100
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
I guess

101
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Anyway Jordan

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
So

103
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Look here here's the other downside of this

104
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
I

105
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Yes indeed we just got news that

106
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
Dirt roads got arrested that one was kind of big

107
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
And boy I would love to talk about that

108
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
And said we're going back to July 23rd 1860 the first time we talked about a civil war

109
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,167
First-time Stuart Rosenthal restaurant

110
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
I was his response to this will be very Illuminating very interesting

111
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
I can't wait to talk about that on Monday

112
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
It frustrates me that there's no way for us to do that for this at the brother

113
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
I was going back

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Through

115
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
Some of the archives

116
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,439
Absent such of Alex's shows and other things on Infowars

117
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Was

118
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
There's a bit of a pattern

119
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
As it relates

120
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
To how are you

121
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Our cover

122
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,727
And so I noticed a number of things surrounding in particular

123
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
The end of April in 2009

124
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Which is when the

125
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
The H1 N1

126
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
Swine flu pandemic

127
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
Was really getting going and and the first cases were identified

128
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
I started to recognize their some

129
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Things that would be

130
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Well worth our time

131
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,559
Time to look at as it relates to Alex's behavior in the present day

132
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Enter awesome

133
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Connections

134
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Almost

135
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
With a little bit of a comment and that is that I mean it no way to minimize the impact of the 2009

136
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Mate1 N1 outbreak in this episode

137
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
I'm not I'm not

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Minimizing or belittling it

139
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
It was a serious Public Health event and a lot of people got sick and died

140
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
I think it's pretty clear from history

141
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
That it wasn't that severe an event is what we're living through it in

142
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
In the present

143
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
The point of this episode that I put together today is

144
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Look at some of Alex

145
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,583
The coverage from the early days of H1 N1 or swine flu outbreak

146
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,215
To highlight the ways that his rhetoric was almost identical to the way he behaved in the early days of the covid pandemic

147
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
At the beginning of 2020

148
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
Alex's tone is changed a bit since that point but

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
It's my contention that

150
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
He's only had to change his rhetoric because he f*****

151
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Over the course

152
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm going to argue that Alex has a method of responding to things like novel outbreak

153
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
There is absolutely nothing to do with the reality of the situation

154
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
But is actually motivated by the utility

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Did this method has in terms of building and pushing

156
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Determine narrative

157
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
These Central narratives are

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
The virus is man-made

159
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Its a bio-weapon

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
It was deployed in order to put in martial law

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
It was deployed in order to make people get vaccine

162
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
And that the vaccines

163
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Will be mandated

164
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
I understand clearly meant to her

165
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,991
In addition to these narratives I contend that Alex also uses some Hallmark techniques in order to reinforce his narrative

166
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
And use asset strategies in order to get his message out

167
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
3D broadcast from 2009 I believe that all this is pretty clearly born out I hope that looking at this week

168
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Be helpful in terms of understanding

169
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
How meaningless

170
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
Was Alex's stories about the present pandemic really are

171
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Earlier I said I was narratives about covid arso convoluted and like all over the map right now because he f***** up and what time

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
I mean by that is this

173
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
In the past I was able to maximize outcomes by following basically the same script that he used at the beginning of the covid app

174
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,319
Penney's instances weather was the avian flu in 2005 Ebola in 2014

175
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
481 and 1 into a 2009

176
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Public Health

177
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Response was Compton

178
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
And we got lucky

179
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
So the diseases didn't end up causing

180
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Service social

181
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Disruption that we see in the last few years

182
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
That's the sweet spot for someone like Alex to work in

183
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
There's a legitimate Public Health concern that he can spread b******* about but the adults working on the actual problems are still able to get

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Their work done

185
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
To avert any real long-running trouble

186
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Alex get the fear Monger make it

187
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,551
The claims and then when things died down he can move on to another subject altogether

188
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
In fact because

189
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Things are being

190
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Competently handled

191
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
He doesn't even really have to make a story like h1m won't be number one story in his rotation everyday over and over

192
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,911
Alex would have had every expectation based on every single time he's done this in the past

193
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
The covid-19 way

194
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
But it didn't

195
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
And you stock

196
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
I believe

197
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
Things gone poorly

198
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
In the past

199
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
And other in

200
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Census

201
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
You would see a similar deterioration

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Just trying to

203
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Stay keep his grip

204
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
All narrative

205
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Things

206
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Spiralizer

207
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Control

208
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
The obvious

209
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Usually the most important

210
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Not most important

211
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
But definitely not coincidental

212
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Thing is that

213
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
The president that he wanted was in the White House at the

214
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
The time that he did not get what he wanted

215
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Made it look like he got what he

216
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Is this irony

217
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,407
It is not irony so much as a self-fulfilling failure Prophet Morissette ironic

218
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
So we're going to start here looking

219
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
Sing at an episode of

220
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Interesting

221
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,695
Jason bermas back in the fold now course the one of the guys who made

222
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Yes

223
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Alex

224
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
I guess

225
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Became best friends

226
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Forever

227
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,191
I honestly think if you look back at some of the earlier times and Infowars history like around

228
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
These

229
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
2008-2009 this stretch

230
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
The time

231
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Shows a lot to Duesenberg

232
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Terms of

233
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
First of all douche

234
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
TS

235
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,527
He was the guy who would fill in for Alex when Alex had no other employees

236
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,671
She was the person who Alex had like as another show right when there were no other shows

237
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
On on the Infowars Network

238
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
Look up Jason Burris has the show the info Warrior

239
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
That's evenings

240
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Cleveland Show

241
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
And on this April 27th 2009 episode

242
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Alex is filling in cuz Jace

243
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Time is running late

244
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
And so Alex gets into a little bit of news

245
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
About

246
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
The h1ad Watch

247
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
Genesis Network Folks up there

248
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,135
If you get them aligned and somebody's not for Mexico or doesn't have family in Mexico or not from San Antonio other areas

249
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Weather Al Briggs

250
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
Nashville to call in later

251
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
Just in the next hour after we get some of these calls

252
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,887
From Mexico or areas affected by this new

253
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
Designer virus is exactly what it looks like

254
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
So we have a presentation already like

255
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,871
This is days after the first cases are identified

256
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
In the United

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
States

258
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Pretty shortly after that news has broken

259
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
The first cases of neck

260
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
And already this is

261
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
Predetermined to be

262
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
A designed virus

263
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Is manufactured

264
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
They did this they put that they cooked

265
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,839
Pizza formula Ozark reaction

266
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
Is just like

267
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
And he doesn't even know how to speak of viruses that aren't designed like the idea of

268
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Do the designer virus the flu you know like

269
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
I think a lot of times you could look at any wild born

270
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Virus

271
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
You know disease

272
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
And you can find something

273
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Suspicious about it

274
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Probably find

275
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
Something that's weird about most

276
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Diseases that

277
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
What I mean

278
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:22,815
Viruses are weird in the first place they're alive but they're not alive what is that even f****** mean you guys are driving me crazy shirt

279
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
Suspicions on there are elements

280
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Prince of swine Avian and human

281
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
Floozy

282
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
That makeup

283
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
This this new novel

284
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Package

285
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Surprising

286
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Experts

287
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
You're not scientists and researchers who weighed in rd2 even at the time

288
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Talk about recombining

289
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
That happens

290
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Like let's say one pig is infected with

291
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Multiple

292
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Viruses that they will trade genetic information are

293
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
And various different

294
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Toulouse combined

295
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
Basically as much as he has for this was designed

296
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Thursdays

297
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Hallmark's

298
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
The three different

299
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Types of

300
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Blue Apron

301
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
But that's you know

302
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
That's stamped

303
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
In the in the narrative immediately

304
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Once you know that it's

305
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Designs

306
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
We got to ask yourself some other questions

307
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,303
Also is swine flu biological weapon excellent article

308
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
That is up on prisonplanet.com that bermas is going to be going over

309
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
Another one is swine flu a biological weapon

310
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Printer friendly version of that

311
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
Yeah I just got to stop over printing here man

312
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
He act like he's reading to headlines

313
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
Has he considered the overhead that comes along with the amount of toner to use

314
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
It's got to be me

315
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
It's crazy when I was making the button

316
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
It was

317
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
You're like no expense

318
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
Everyday what are these facts about

319
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Empty paper

320
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,287
Yeah it's unreal

321
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Probably not surprised

322
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,455
But this headline with Alex's reading suggesting that swine flu could be a biological weapon was written by Paul Joseph W

323
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Paul is hip

324
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
By this point 2009 and seems to be aware that he should probably cover his ass

325
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
So this article starts like the

326
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
There are some factors

327
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
It suggests the swine flu killing people in Mexico may be a biological weapon

328
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
But obviously no such

329
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,655
Conclusion can be drawn at this time Manuel done Paul

330
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Delete a false story is that there's no conclusive answer but wouldn't it be fun to spend the next 12 or so paragraphs heavily insinuating

331
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
But you don't have a conclusive answer but

332
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
What you think of this wine for probably is biological weapon

333
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
Has written largely relies on an alleged

334
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
Source who spoke to former regular Infowars ghast Wayne Madsen

335
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:00,511
Wayne is one of Alex's old best buddies and he was the guy who broke that story about Hillary Clinton

336
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
Personal chef being found dead

337
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
With a note attached to him that said call Larry Nichols

338
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
So you know that this dude is credible as hell

339
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
He stopped talking to Alex a little bit after Alex wanted all the info

340
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
For Trump

341
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
A lunatic

342
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Probably sent those bad for his brain

343
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
William Source apparently told him that he was quote

344
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Convinced

345
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
Current outbreak of a new strain of swine flu in Mexico

346
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
In some parts of the United States is the result of

347
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Introduction of a human engineered pathogen

348
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,927
They could result in a widespread global

349
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,255
Pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences for domestic

350
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
International travel

351
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
And commerce

352
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Who plays with the knife's edge

353
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,983
Stressing that it's too early to say anything with certainty but also and the article with this paragraph

354
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,871
Quote fears that a mass pandemic was being ready does a biological attack have rumble.on and the

355
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Conspiracy Community ever since 9/11

356
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,783
Investigators point to the highly unusual number of deaths of top microbiologist

357
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Suggest

358
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
The people with knowledge of the program are being eliminated

359
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
That's funny

360
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
That's a fun

361
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,303
Since 9/11 conspiracy might have said that about every virus since f****** before that

362
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Through dead bodies into

363
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Two castles

364
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
They're like all those guys are man-made that virus

365
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
You know ucuc historical

366
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
I think that 1918 was prior to

367
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,151
2911

368
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,247
Theories about that one

369
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Meow

370
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
To ask Pollock what investigators are pointing

371
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
To this kind of stuff again

372
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Play it like this

373
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
Some investigators have said

374
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Seems like a some b*******

375
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,911
It's been used to freak readers out make them have fears about this Mass pandemic being launched

376
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Biological attack

377
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
Just like in forwards does all the time it seems like

378
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
This this and that to justifying whatever it is

379
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,687
Insinuations you're making throughout the article is just like well we do this a lot

380
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,319
Don't you understand it's normal for us that's wrong that's wrong

381
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,719
It's important to understand that a large part of what Alex has been doing over the course of the current pandemic is part of a larger pattern

382
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,071
And seeing the same stuff play out another. Then it could be really helpful and illustrating

383
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Exactly

384
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
He's full of s***

385
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
The reality is he's doing these exact same things that we saw the beginning of the pandemic

386
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Here in the past

387
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,127
And you would have been doing exactly the same thing that he's doing good luck it better public

388
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
Responsibilities are brakes not getting as bad as

389
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Things have gotten

390
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Today

391
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
And we see like a really concrete example

392
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,671
I'm also it's up to 149 confirmed dead in Mexico

393
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
They're clearly suppressing

394
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Those numbers even according to the BBC

395
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,935
It may be difficult to remember this now but when covid was just emerging

396
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
It wasn't a huge denial is

397
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
It's about it he was a sensationalist

398
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
And one of his main narratives in the beginning

399
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,407
Was that China was suppressing the numbers of dead by

400
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Attic magnitude

401
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
I think it's probably fair to say that there wasn't totaled

402
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Transparency with China's reporting

403
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,391
But that has no bearing on how irresponsible and dishonest the kind of reporting Alex did was

404
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
This is from March

405
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
May 4th 2020

406
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Coronavirus situation in Mali

407
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Biological weapons expert

408
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,679
Top scientist scanning the virus and saying it's man-made

409
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
You got to get ahead of this if you notice

410
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Virus numbers

411
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
Thousand confirmed we're locked in here a few minutes go 24,000

412
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
The internal Chinese numbers that leaked

413
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
Rocket publish in China by the people daily

414
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
24000 dead

415
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Yesterday

416
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
They're doing is they're just

417
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
Putting the number of dadaism

418
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
This is part of Alex's early sensationalism which employees because it's profitable and generally there isn't any real

419
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Consequences because

420
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
Public Health Protocols are handled response

421
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
At this point Alex and every reason to assume that the 2019 coronavirus will be like all the other house scares heat sensation

422
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Flies in the bath

423
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
And this was the model that he is used to maximize his profits he's behaving exactly the same way

424
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Easy multiple elements of this

425
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Exact same script

426
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,071
The it was a maid in the lab without held by a build by the bad guys

427
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,423
And also they are covering up exactly how

428
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
Hey did they there's a grander scale of the death

429
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
But they're lying to us about

430
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
All consist

431
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,455
The only difference the only thing that's different is that the person he wanted to be running the

432
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Country was running the country

433
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
At Cross purposes

434
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,087
This is with the organization that was supposed to be the adults trying to

435
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Stop all this

436
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Crazy how that works

437
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
It's almost like there's a very simple direct lesson to be learned

438
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
I don't think we'll ever do it probably not

439
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Alex also

440
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
The present things that you would do

441
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
I guess you just do this all the time actually isn't really a connection

442
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Between

443
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
These two insta

444
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Centers of Public Health

445
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Think it's kind of

446
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Consistent pattern that is

447
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Misuse of sources

448
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:10,015
So he has an interview that he's going to bring up

449
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
Has interview with this retired General Honore

450
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
Which is I know this name

451
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
Because Alex will reference him a lot

452
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
But it's fun because at this point 2009

453
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
I'll just no idea who he is

454
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
It's really fun to watch him trying pronounce the name

455
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
Avon prisonplanet.com there's another

456
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,008
Headline of a CNN clip-in fat guys let's get that video clip ready

457
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Put on a play that clip

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
Coming up once Obamas is

459
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
He ran on the show

460
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Retired army General Russell

461
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
Believe you pronounce at Honore with

462
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
French

463
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Squiggly on the end of it

464
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
How do you pronounce that

465
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,304
Honore with it come out

466
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
Retired army General Russell

467
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
On the Run

468
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,776
Mexico from

469
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,360
Able to find that out in all previous pandemics

470
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
The question now is

471
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Big heart

472
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
How to start it it start from me

473
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,368
Occasion of ours is coming together or did it come out of the lab all those questions have to be answered

474
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,256
Most doctors medical doctors virologist we've talked to their own record said it had to be weaponized an engineer will tell you when we get back

475
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Po-boy

476
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,168
You can see here this that makes very clear parallel between Alex's swine-flu coverage until things began with covid

477
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
He's focusing attention on building up the narratives that

478
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
The flu came out of the lab

479
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Bad was built

480
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Bye-bye

481
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Got to get it out

482
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,664
The reason he does this is pretty simple but there's actually two prongs to it

483
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,504
The first is that if it came up from nature there's no real bad guy

484
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,344
I'll just trying to deal with his wild-born disease that threatens us all

485
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
It's not really all that

486
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Exciting

487
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
It came from the lab and there's an entry

488
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,024
These meddling scientists as either outright villains

489
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Or people who probably meant well but we're tampering with forces outside of what God wants man to tamper with

490
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,520
Would you like to us meeting more movies about mad scientist than there are of like

491
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,128
The crops aren't as good this year have we rock

492
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
The second reason is because reporting

493
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
All of these potential outbreak stories out of their roots in the lab

494
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
It helps

495
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Bolster anti-vax

496
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Text narratives General Trust

497
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Austin science

498
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,536
There's an added element to this to which is that they it's always reported as vaccine research gone wrong

499
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,864
That led to this lab accident of the release of this alleged bioweapon

500
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,448
Which has the effect of associating vaccine development With Disaster

501
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Any audience is mine

502
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,080
This interview that retired General Honore did with CNN

503
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Between him and Donald

504
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
Here's the exchange that Alex's basing this

505
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Insinuation

506
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
Lemon is pointed out

507
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
People isn't important

508
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm part of a national strategy

509
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
D2 Public Health

510
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Response and Honore says quote

511
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Informant

512
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
So people can make informed decisions

513
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
That will help us that will help stop.

514
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,584
The spread of the disease but you know the key question we've got to ask is

515
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
We think it came from

516
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
That's the conventional wisdom of most

517
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
The next question is how did it start

518
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Where did emanate

519
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,616
We've been able to find out that in all previous pandemics

520
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
The question is

521
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
To get at the heart of how did this start

522
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
Did it start from the occasion of irises coming together

523
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Or was it did it come out of the lab

524
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
I mean all these questions have to be in

525
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,512
I don't seems I can possibly splitting hairs but I sincerely believe there's a relevant difference between someone saying it's important to understand where

526
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Where the virus came from

527
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
And the way Alex was reporting

528
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Hang on these,

529
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,960
The difference is that interviews like these with General Honore are open-ended

530
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
In terms of laying at questions that are on the table where is Alex's coverage is designed to lead the listener to a predetermined

531
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Conclusion

532
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
The goal is to cover this as a lab related outbreak in Alex uses

533
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
Is autoreise comment further that goal

534
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,160
You can see that by the way that Alex is tailored the headline as to only include the part where it's suggestive the virus came from Lab

535
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
And of course the part of

536
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
The end where you saying that all experts are saying that weapon.

537
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Yeah that part

538
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
It was really a

539
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,888
Yeah it's a little over a little out of hand

540
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
You know like he was like we don't know exactly and then they turned into this is a bioweapon that's a little bit

541
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
I do think they're like

542
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
He saying that all the EX

543
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
Experts and scientists that we've talked to his that that

544
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
Possibly

545
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
If you didn't specifically only talk to crazy

546
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,416
We talked to three people with rabies and they all agreed and everyone in the mouth

547
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Stories of all the people that I talk to that everyone at rabies

548
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,960
Spoke to upset

549
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah and insult

550
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Of course

551
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
You know we have this establish

552
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
This is from a lab

553
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
And now we got to build

554
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,784
LSU's the club with a retired General on CNN pointing out that this could be made the lab when you get

555
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,112
All these different viruses mixed together

556
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
We were you get the a pig for the swine flu this bird flu and human flu

557
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
I all mixed together

558
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
Classically historically

559
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,192
That isn't here in the lab and then you always have it coming from the East

560
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,056
Blue season 2 always comes from the East they do streams always

561
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
This originated in Mexico City

562
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,712
And I don't about it since I March 18th Elation we're busy covering it up

563
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
So scared is cuz it's killing healthy

564
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
They all virile 18 to 30 year old

565
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,696
I meant women mainly the death tolls now upwards of 149

566
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Whitewash number

567
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,120
Doesn't really dishonest way to leap off of Honore CNN interview

568
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
There's no reason to believe that just because the 2009 H1 N1 virus had elements of swine Avian and human

569
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
That means it had to be made in a lab

570
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Conclusion for a number of reasons

571
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,040
The first is that it's entirely possible for this kind of recombination to happen in nature

572
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,696
Pigs or people could be infected with multiple flu simultaneously and then they can recombine and ways with a trade genetic information

573
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
According to the CDC quote

574
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,096
Each of the dream segments within the 2009 H1 N1 influenza virus

575
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Have been founded pigs for more than

576
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Send 10 years prior to

577
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
To the beginning

578
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Have a 2009 H1 N1 influenza outbreak

579
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,360
Pics of long been considered a possible mixing vessel for influenza viruses that originated within Pig

580
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Big Bird

581
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
In addition a 2009 nature study showed

582
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,320
That Resort meant between influenza viruses found in North American and Eurasian pigs

583
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
Had already occurred at least once naturally

584
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
In the five years prior to the I-10

585
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,232
Application of the 2009 H1 N1

586
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
So they're pressing

587
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
Yeah see now this is one of those times

588
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Times where I feel like

589
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
Scientist need somebody like me right now

590
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
Next to a bar

591
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Explain that

592
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Right cuz they're like

593
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
And then the other viruses and then they recombine and that's how we can see that stuff and I could just be there and be like

594
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
F****** sidem

595
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
And then we be fine everybody would understand that better than its more relatable

596
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Best eyesight isn't an approach

597
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,912
There's no need for lab to be involved to explain the complex nature of the virus but Alex's obscuring that and it's a further push it

598
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
Is predetermined conclusion that the virus had to come from a lab

599
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
Justice is done consistently since the beginning of covid he's jump

600
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
All over the place

601
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Trying to find these weird

602
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
Explanation for why it had to be

603
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Baton the lab

604
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Been falling flattened

605
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
He's kind of forgotten about

606
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
As for the idea that flus come from the East

607
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
That's actually kind of been borne out by Reese

608
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Search but it's not a

609
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
A study by the University of Chicago noted that

610
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,120
Between 2000-2010 87% of the quote

611
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,984
Most successful globally spreading strains of H3 end to originated at East

612
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
South and Southeast Asia

613
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,848
M3m to of course being the most common disease causing

614
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Strength

615
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,760
This is a high number but it also does tell us another little fact and that is that it's not unheard of for flus pop-up another look at

616
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
There's a good 13% there that

617
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
And this is also a successful global

618
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Spreading strain

619
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Pretzel

620
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
You know if there are

621
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
It doesn't have to have come from the East

622
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,120
Easily have popped up in Mexico

623
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
That is not

624
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Like some sort of

625
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
It comes from the East

626
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Because Easter's

627
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,872
Concept and it comes from an environment and an ecosphere

628
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
Please just because that's where it is in our head

629
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
It could be anywhere

630
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
And there's there's some

631
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
Non-consensus what side

632
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,672
Series about exactly why that phenomenon is the case

633
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Weather has to do with

634
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Something about population

635
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Patterns ardesa do with the

636
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
The climate early

637
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,912
Clear but there are people themselves

638
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
Doing a tune-up

639
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Weirdly close to that

640
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
2009 H1 N1 date affect younger people more severely with people over sea

641
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
65 being less vulnerable

642
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,648
However what do you think about there being a cover-up of anything is just not founded

643
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
In any way

644
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,536
And here we see another common feature of how Alex reports on public health matters in the immediate

645
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,424
It's important to cast suspicion on all other sources of information so no matter what the reality of the situation is

646
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
You lead with a

647
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Accusing them of a cover

648
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,360
By this point the CDC was already posting updates about what information have been learned up till that point

649
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
The center for infectious

650
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,456
Disease research and policy were sounding the alarm

651
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
State governments are posting guidance for people to panic and help them guide

652
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
Themselves through any possible

653
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Health problems

654
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
Cnn-ibn reported on cases that have been

655
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,536
I confirmed in California to I do I don't know what to a cover-up Alex's

656
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
Talk about cuz there wasn't

657
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
The suggestion that there was a

658
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
Crucial to undermine and Trust in public health

659
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
Expert which helps Alex present himself as the

660
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Actual expert to Azadi

661
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
Around every corner in the present pandemic there been accusations

662
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
The cover-ups

663
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
Because it's an easy thing to do and you've never have to back it up

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Nope

665
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Play Sia.

666
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,832
And if the thing about that makes

667
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
It's so good it's no matter what they're telling

668
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Cuz yes you

669
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
You see all this stuff

670
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
You can always claim they're covering up something

671
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,608
Sure it's in the news that their cases in LA but they're covering up their case

672
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
What's magical about that too

673
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
As if

674
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,336
You just have a vague notion that there's a cover-up your mind gets to imagine whatever you want as you want yes

675
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
And if months later something comes out that wasn't in the reporting

676
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
Any anoculus reason for any reason

677
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
I secretly knew that all

678
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,048
When did I didn't say that did happen to be the case is the one that I'm

679
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
So at this point

680
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,728
I presented you with this information and how do you feel about what Alex wants the audience

681
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
To think about

682
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
This

683
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
This virus feel like

684
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Lucky one

685
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,688
What's to let them know that the government is murdering them as they speak

686
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
And that if they're not terrified and giving him money

687
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
It's all over

688
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
Brothers cover up

689
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
Wilshire battery wanted specific

690
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
There's cover up chairs this was

691
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,072
Clearly made in the lab who's covered down

692
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
It was a bioweapon most likely came from outside the United States

693
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
And

694
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
There

695
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,592
Like reporting fraudulently low death number two more people are dying in this off

696
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,432
Do you think kind of thing you're supposed to be scared of this study be terrified

697
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
I feel like that

698
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
The tone

699
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
We get to this boy

700
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
Deftones now upwards of 149

701
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Whitewash number

702
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
But much still this is a bunch of high

703
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,560
Pictures of regular flu strains every year millions of people worldwide

704
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,888
1000 / 15000 year in the u.s.

705
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Even more Mexico

706
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,520
But when we see all this so massive media have to question

707
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
This is an important element

708
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
The presentation to zoom in on real clothes

709
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
Infuriated Alex doesn't want his daughter

710
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
To actually be super afraid of the H1 N1

711
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Flew in the same way he doesn't actually want the audio

712
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,368
To be afraid of covid-19 or did he at the beginning

713
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,976
He wants to build up a sense of fear Foster distrust in Mainline sources

714
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
And then transmute that fear that he's established

715
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
Into being fear something else that he wants them to be afraid

716
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Possibly

717
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
Company profits Amour

718
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Pushes his extremist agenda

719
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
Generally usually

720
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
You should be afraid because these people are clearly building a virus and a lab at the bioweapon it's killing people to rate the globalist to cover up

721
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
But also it's all because

722
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Please kill

723
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
People thought all black people every year

724
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
Really kind of an insane thing

725
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,184
If you stop and think about it's jarring what he's implying and then the

726
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Just like

727
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
But hey don't worry about it's not flu

728
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
The first part of this would lead you to think you should be very afraid of the fact that you villains are created by 11 and for some reason there

729
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
Covering up how many people have died from it

730
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
Heavily implies that the virus is something to be deeply can

731
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Concerned about

732
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
The second part to play

733
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,176
That sends the message that this is scary than any of flu every year

734
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
That's crazy this is confusing if you don't pay attention because it's inherently nonsense

735
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,648
If it's all hype and no different than every flu why does this coverage

736
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Exist

737
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,280
Is the numbers are no different than they are every year why would the globalist put out decrease death numbers

738
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
What sense does that make

739
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:48,448
It's the same as every year why would the globalist need to cover up the flues existence for a few months

740
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
Does Alex's implying

741
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,056
Alex wouldn't have gone through all the effort of laying that track

742
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
If it weren't for the purposes

743
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm shipping

744
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
A narrative down the road

745
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
Towards what he actually wants

746
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Sporting Store

747
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Right

748
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
I mean

749
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Insane

750
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Okay

751
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
So you're telling me that the flu

752
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Who is not man-made

753
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
And he's just a natural disaster part of the natural order

754
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,840
I assume you probably would rather not talk about that

755
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
But but like okay

756
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Scared of a tsunami

757
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Tearing the entire East Coast Park

758
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,336
But that's horrific what is tsunami but rain

759
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,664
Comparison arizola

760
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
Yes that's

761
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Terrifying

762
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
The but nobody's Direct

763
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Thing that it is

764
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
Even more of a crisis that needs to be reacted to

765
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
If just

766
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
1 dew drop the bomb that

767
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Who gave a tsunami on the coast

768
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Georgia

769
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:48,352
That's not as bad as God level strike of the entire East Coast

770
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
But that's a guy doing it we got to react to that real

771
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
Is who knows who knows what

772
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
It's up to you can't be saying like hey don't worry about the government created by a weapon to kill a bunch of people in Mexico but that's no

773
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,272
The flu like no girl we got to deal with that now we do but

774
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,344
Alex wants to deal with it in the way that he wants

775
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
The deal with that and I did already

776
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Kind of get assigned

777
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Based on

778
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:18,048
I don't know everything we've gone through the way that there's going to be

779
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Beers of lockdown

780
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
Years of vaccinations being forced on you

781
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,008
Can't exactly you build up the fear the way he has so far

782
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
And then deflate the fear the actual

783
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
Condition and use that for your that you've built

784
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
How to build your own gingerbread house

785
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:38,528
Saphir that looks like a FEMA camp this is really really scary now calm down

786
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:44,928
This is not what you should be afraid of you should be more afraid of compound

787
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
Move this way

788
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
So Jason bermas comes in

789
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
He shows up. He's got some thoughts

790
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
Check my emails last night

791
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,984
Apparently Baxter is going to be the one in charge of immunizing for this

792
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,360
Yeah that's right go ahead and only 2 months ago and

793
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Mid-February

794
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
I actually was late February the Bloomberg reported on it

795
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
I'm there

796
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Sent out

797
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
214 separate countries this

798
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Batch of

799
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
Anti bird flu vaccine

800
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
That contained

801
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
Two different strains of bird flu

802
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
And then a third strain of flu

803
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
And this is just incredible to me

804
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
That we would

805
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,472
Allow Baxter to be the people in charge

806
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,544
Of inoculation and immunizing

807
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
The populist

808
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
Mistresses

809
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,688
True from WebMD in 2009

810
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,040
46% of the vaccines manufacturer to the United States were made by Novartis

811
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
26% were from sanofi Pasteur

812
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
19%

813
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
Mcsl 6% from medimmune

814
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
3% from glaxo Smith

815
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Klein and none of these are Baxter's Secret

816
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,424
Baxter talked a big game but they ended up getting beaten out by other suppliers that came to the market

817
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,032
In October 2009 after Baxter had one part of the contract

818
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Display H1 N1 vaccine

819
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
Things to the United Kingdom

820
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
It came out that they had been forced

821
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
The payback million

822
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
The state governments were overcharging them for products

823
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
To the past and committing Medicare fraud today

824
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
I mean

825
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
Hot water who Among Us has not tried

826
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
To commit some

827
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,000
Sort of Medicare fraud Auto large-scale

828
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:30,400
Additionally Baxter did have a mix-up at a lab that they run in Austria being a little exaggerated Viber

829
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
Actually happened where live avian flu hit

830
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Contaminated some experimental samples

831
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
That they'd sent to a couple other lab

832
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
It was a bad mix up and could have had some

833
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Some seriously bad cops

834
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:45,504
But ultimately just ended up killing a few ferrets which is still sad right but investigations into it

835
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
Sound no hot like no

836
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
We only kill.

837
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
No power player

838
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
There wasn't

839
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
There's a specific goal is being pursued by coverage like this

840
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
The pharmacist doing

841
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Caswell

842
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,192
The point of this is to establish the groundwork that there's something suspicious about the plans to develop effect

843
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Maxine for this new flu virus

844
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
There must be a real

845
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Reasons of the globalist are having all of our vaccines made by there's one specific company that recently bungled a shipment of experimental sample

846
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
They must want to have these vaccines if they put into

847
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Contaminated to

848
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Introducing these sorts of narratives

849
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
What is the first step of the essential pivot that need

850
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,928
Needs to happen where the fear that being built about the virus

851
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
He's transformed interfere about the vaccine

852
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
That's

853
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Eustis

854
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
It's pretty remarkable how this is almost just muscle memory for them to be able to

855
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
To build up and move

856
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Yeah I mean

857
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
The thing about

858
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Like ways to combat

859
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Bulshit

860
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
Is that they have to constantly evolve

861
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
And the thing about bulshit is that it's

862
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
State exactly the same for mine

863
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Entire f******

864
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
And it just comes up and different

865
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Spots like wackamole

866
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,184
You know yeah I think I actually we're going to get to a pretty

867
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,048
Pretty Salient examples

868
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
Here's another

869
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
Peacefully gets brought up that I think you'll see

870
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Heavy

871
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Overlap with a

872
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
The swine flu

873
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
All over the media people are hyped up I I didn't see where I was cuz I wasn't in the city but you can bet within the next week if they

874
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
This stays in the news

875
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,504
That people will be wearing the mask they will be wearing bandanas around their face

876
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
I mean this is a big ball I was already in

877
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
Associated Press this morning

878
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,512
How did the federal government came out and said yeah people need to go ahead and start wearing masks

879
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,816
Affected areas inside the United States show

880
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
Either the government is viciously

881
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,936
Hi bring this to get people to take more vaccines in the text

882
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
Dakota antivirals

883
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,848
The wife lose been mentioned

884
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
Right now tied into Rumsfeld in the bushes and

885
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,992
Not even now the president current President Barack Obama

886
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Is a profiting from that

887
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,392
So you can see here this almost identical language to the president

888
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Just fear hysteria and it's all in

889
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Services

890
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
The forest vaccines on you

891
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,840
Fwiw Alex never got to the second option after bermas interrupted

892
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
I've no idea what they was going

893
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Wayans brothers

894
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
Tamiflu

895
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,264
Tamiflu is not a publicly traded at

896
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
It's a product that's produced by Gilead

897
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,152
The reality to is that Alex is wrong

898
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
Gillian was not

899
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
Seeing record stock prices in April 2009

900
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Their Peak was on August

901
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,880
Fourth 2008 coming in at about $28.50 a share

902
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
The Davis episode is recorded their shares

903
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
They hit a high of $24 in 11

904
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,912
Their numbers would start going up eventually but it wouldn't be until late 2011 and a large part of that was likely due to enthusiasm

905
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Acquisition

906
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
But they've made buying up a ton of Pharma companies like

907
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
CV Therapeutics

908
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
CGI

909
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,592
Shockingly

910
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,687
There is some truth to the claim that Obama had a very small interest in Gilead

911
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,527
In May 2009 CNN reviewed his financial invest

912
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,367
Predominantly is Investments were in US Treasury Bonds in like

913
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Accounts for his children

914
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,999
But he also did have money in an index fund called Vanguard

915
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
That fund is holding

916
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Things in a bunch of other companies

917
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
And Gilead is number 10 on their list

918
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
The most held

919
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
I think so

920
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Very indirect way you

921
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,543
Claim that Obama profits from Gilead but what Alex is claiming as a bit of a stir

922
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,615
Yeah if Alex just wants to go all the way in

923
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,431
Book officials Campground stock I'll join them in that but otherwise

924
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
This is all just blustery nonsense

925
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
Yeah yeah I'm for the no public

926
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
Look official Zone in stock

927
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
Cafe life safer

928
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Too obvious

929
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:40,511
Yeah I think of an ideal world everybody should be able to invest in whatever they want

930
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Close to there

931
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,631
You see here is another standard feature of Alex's public health coverage

932
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,007
There needs to be an insistent that insistence that Alex's political enemies are painted as corrupt

933
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
With their motives chalked up to their financial stake

934
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
It needs fine.

935
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
These pharmaceutical company

936
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,503
We saw this exact Same Song & Dance Play out in the covid pandemic ever

937
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,367
Trump was in office so it wasn't going to fly to start tossing around ideas about his

938
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Dances so

939
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
The safer route

940
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Insisted Bill Gates had the patent

941
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
But also the virus itself

942
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:18,399
Well you might have had some interest in pharmaceutical companies or he does through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

943
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
Gates doesn't himself hope at dawn.

944
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
He came out as

945
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,383
In favor of dropping the patent protection on the vaccines in order to allow greater access

946
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
For them a developing country

947
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
Although probably too late on the

948
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Maybe maybe

949
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,807
Come to that conclusion a little early

950
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,135
Play tourettes to the list of owners of the patent

951
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,951
We're making money off of Axion but to be fair to him

952
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,279
Like you didn't know who fauci was at the beginning for a while so you could

953
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Syracuse massage

954
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
I think I think what is

955
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Is ridiculous about the

956
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
Bisnow especially on his face after having lived through all of this week

957
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Put this

958
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
Type of conspiracy to bed

959
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
There's only one way to

960
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,383
Evilly profit off of

961
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Pharmaceuticals

962
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Annette's just

963
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
Plainly taking

964
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Insulin

965
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
Charging $1,000

966
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
You know like we see the Griff

967
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Tough

968
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
To conceive of

969
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
Who is doing something more

970
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
Yeah in our faces and on

971
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
What are bills

972
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:30,079
The real problem is that Obama has some money in this index

973
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,479
Text Mom that hold some Gilead

974
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
Michelle was really into

975
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
No diet

976
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
And I should tell you also hold a lot of stock in McDonald's

977
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,631
The point here is that all leaders who advise

978
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Caution or public health measures they're only doing so because they want to create fear hysteria in order to Corral you into getting this

979
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
Because then they profit from

980
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
This story plays out over and over again because it's a myth

981
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,223
Cycle it's not actually analysis of the news

982
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
This is basically Alex's

983
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Version of Joseph

984
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
Yeah it doesn't make any sense

985
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
It doesn't make any sense cuz what you would do

986
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Okay is you would want to

987
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Get the population

988
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
To all have some sort of

989
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
Version of diabetes

990
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
So like if you wanted to invest in a pharmaceutical company

991
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
And then create a conspiracy

992
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
That would make you a ton of money then you would do that and then you would try and flood the market of the United States with some sort of high

993
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Sugar content

994
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
You know something and then you what you really want to do is get

995
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
To really be into it so you put

996
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,367
Like I should have cartoon characters and all of these people they would advertise it for you and then they would push that out there

997
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,415
And then so many people would get an image

998
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
You become part of their daily lives

999
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
I'm sorry

1000
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
You can even take a step back and look at it like

1001
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
From the perspective

1002
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,167
Financial motivations really were guiding some of this stuff

1003
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
There be no reason to actually backs

1004
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Funny people

1005
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
What's the company's got me

1006
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Please contract

1007
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,687
That's good enough

1008
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:16,831
About the next one at 4 you be dead by then there's just a lot of a lot of balls

1009
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Need to be chocolates here

1010
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
So speaking of balls that need to be juggled Alex has a lot of iron

1011
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
In the fire and I mix

1012
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Metaphors

1013
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
And there's a reason for that

1014
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
Don't come piling up my stack of news before you came in because

1015
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,191
Imma be on Coast to Coast AM for several hours tonight

1016
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Yeah I know I've got a

1017
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,543
6:45 this morning which other slept in

1018
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:41,151
I had it for a half hours today when we went to Dover drive so I'm going to get out of here

1019
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
But one of the biggest stories

1020
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
Look for while we play this clip I had it here in and I can't find it

1021
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,087
It was up on infowars.com

1022
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,695
Back in early March car tomorrow to story when it came out in government documents

1023
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
But the Nets

1024
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:00,351
The government has predicted a deadly pandemic flu

1025
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
In 2009

1026
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
In 1996

1027
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,775
Wow so we're talking 15 years ago

1028
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
Smoking gone offline

1029
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,895
Planning this season

1030
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Amazing

1031
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,063
Because you see to the major elements that Alex needs to make his whole pageant to success

1032
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:25,951
The first is have a platform that the larger than his and presumably more mainstream that'll allow him to come on in

1033
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,511
Present himself as an expert suggests

1034
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
Are the present-day that's Joe Rogan

1035
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,167
Job but in 2009 Rogan wasn't a gigantic Lee popular podcaster

1036
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
It wasn't useful for alley

1037
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
What's in that way

1038
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
We will do in a pinch

1039
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
We'll get to that in a minute

1040
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
But first I want to get into that second Bass

1041
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
The almost too perfect

1042
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,919
Document that Alex's found

1043
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:50,015
In order for this whole charade to go off right and for Alex to be able to come

1044
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Control

1045
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,183
Directs Their Fear there needs to be some kind of document that could be used to illustrate that the globalist have been planning this all along

1046
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,743
Which means that Alex is right and that means you got to listen to him

1047
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,047
You're not current performance of this play

1048
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
They're actually a ton of documents that if it this role with Alex and his menagerie of weirdos cherry-picking things to suit their

1049
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Precision proof

1050
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Definitely that this pandemic is

1051
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:16,127
Is a false flag made up there is a raft of Toronto

1052
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,687
I would say the bass on my experience velox

1053
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:24,319
Stop document is the one that Alex seems to prevent is the most concrete and most persuasive so I'm going to give it that title

1054
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
For the present-day pandemic

1055
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
And here in 2009 we happen to have another

1056
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Two perfect document

1057
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
I'll tell you the tracking this one down was really hard

1058
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,399
Because Alex gives almost no details on it other than it was on his website

1059
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,215
Possibly in March and apparently written by Kurt Nimmo

1060
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
If you try to Search keywords like

1061
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,103
30 million dead prediction 2009

1062
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
1996 something

1063
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
You don't come up with anything but

1064
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
Thanks to the way back

1065
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,807
Machine I was able to go through all of the headlines published 2009

1066
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
And I get paid

1067
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,487
This current number article is headline US Air Force study proposed 2009 influenza pandemic in 1996

1068
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:09,631
The underlying document is a thought experiment from the air University tiled Air Force 2025

1069
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
That's described as quote

1070
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
A study to identify the concept

1071
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
Capabilities and Technologies the United States

1072
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,383
Will require to remain the dominant are in space force in the first quarter of the 21st Century

1073
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,247
This document is literally the exact same thing as the lockstep

1074
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
Exact

1075
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
Eczema

1076
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
Nefarious plan

1077
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
This was an exercise

1078
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
To brainstorm what the Air Force would need to do to

1079
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,767
Continue effectively into the future

1080
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
In order to carry out that exercise the research participants

1081
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Created six different

1082
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
Alternative future scenarios

1083
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
Explore possible challenges in

1084
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
They use three variable

1085
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
American worldview Tech

1086
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
And the world power

1087
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
Each of these at two values pause

1088
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
American world you could either be Global or domestic

1089
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Tekkit either because

1090
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Constrained or

1091
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Exponential

1092
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
And the power grid could be concentrated or dispersed

1093
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
For instance if you want

1094
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,183
Explore World War the American world global

1095
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
Tech is constrained and power grid

1096
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Is dispersed

1097
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,839
You be looking at their scenario tour title to Gulliver's Travels

1098
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,167
There are five other scenarios but for our purposes we don't

1099
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
I need to go through all of them in my new.

1100
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Details

1101
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,055
Each of the scenarios include the section title to plausible history

1102
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,127
Which is an exercise description of how the world got to

1103
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,943
Point it is and their imagined version of 2025

1104
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
These are Imagine

1105
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
Made up things

1106
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
And if you want to go eat

1107
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,599
Cherry pick whatever you want out of it

1108
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,743
Princeton tennis Gulliver's travail scenario China broke up into 15 new territories in 2006

1109
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,303
And apparently this year 2022

1110
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
It's just a title

1111
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,423
Africa Wars

1112
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Outlook

1113
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,519
Does Mario Kart demo is decided to focus on is one called digital

1114
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Cacophony

1115
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,127
This is one where the global global American worldview

1116
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Supernatural Tech

1117
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,431
First power grid

1118
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:05,087
In this scenario is plausible history there's an influenza the kills 30 million people in 2009 but there's other things in here that

1119
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,623
But to be red flags for anybody thinking

1120
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,159
This is reflective of planning

1121
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Princeton

1122
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,815
And it's plausible history we're supposed to reach the state of abundant food due to genetics in 2002

1123
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,119
Also the UN dissolved in 2000

1124
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,447
It's also going to be tough because I'm 2015

1125
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,239
At least 48 countries have weapons

1126
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
The mass

1127
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,871
Also in 2020 we buy that point we have a ton of space settlement

1128
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
Oh that's nice that goes along with the flu

1129
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,807
Parcels

1130
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
If you read the report the flu outbreak is included in this scenario is a reminder that though this is a possible future that's dominated by

1131
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
A technological advance

1132
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Quotes

1133
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,583
Technology could not solve some old problems

1134
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
All right so I figured out how to do

1135
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Defeat Alex

1136
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
Game here

1137
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Alright

1138
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
No one can think about the future ever

1139
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,079
Never engagement

1140
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:03,199
Don't you dare do that

1141
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,807
Take historical things and then put them in a possible future

1142
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,391
That's just you saying that the future is going to have you have a calendar

1143
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Burditt

1144
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:18,815
Yes every calendar that has more months than the day that you're on Burnet anybody ask you what you're going to do tomorrow punch

1145
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,911
So-dimm Ozark was really interesting too because

1146
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:28,031
He's trying to use this document to build a conspiracy about the Baxter flu lab mix up

1147
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
But it happened

1148
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Previously

1149
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
Interested

1150
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
Is it merely a coincidence

1151
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,687
What's the Pentagon would propose in 1996

1152
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
The deadly flu pandemic

1153
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
2009

1154
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
When live

1155
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:43,135
H 5 n 1 avian flu viruses are discovered in vaccines produced by Baxter International plants

1156
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
In Austria

1157
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
He goes on to cite Paul Joseph Watson

1158
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
The fact

1159
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
Baxter mix it's deadly H5 N1 virus with a mix of h3n to seasonal flu viruses is smoking

1160
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
Wright's call Jose

1161
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Watson

1162
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,079
The H5 N1 virus on its own has killed hundreds of people but it's less airborne and more restricted in the

1163
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
The ease with which act

1164
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,223
Can spread however when combined with seasonal flu viruses which as everyone knows are super are born in

1165
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
And easily spread

1166
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
The effective approach

1167
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,343
Super Airborne super deadly biological weapon

1168
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Of the sort

1169
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
Proposed in Air Force 20

1170
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
325

1171
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
That's a lot of supers

1172
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
Very suspiciously those last words

1173
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
Quotes of the sort

1174
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
Proposed in Air Force 2025

1175
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Those are part of the quote

1176
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
From Paul

1177
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:32,287
That was Nimmo adding a little editorial and completely fabricating the idea that this document proposes of biological weapon

1178
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,823
Sure nonsense

1179
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,919
In the scenario they say that no one ever figure it out if it was a naturally occurring

1180
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,223
Fluor it was a

1181
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
That makes

1182
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
Cin-cin the scenarios parameters

1183
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
It's a world with

1184
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
Boundless dispersed technology and Power

1185
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,415
What are the main Hallmarks of a

1186
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
The challenges that they have is that there is an increasing number of states

1187
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
And non-state actors that have weapons of mass destruction

1188
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,399
Leaving the Genesis of his flu outbreak ambiguous creates flavor

1189
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
In the picture that they're painting

1190
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
For the scenario exercise

1191
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Anyway curtain Mo sucks

1192
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,591
And even he had no clue that this would be able to be

1193
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,151
Best one that holds extra narrative didn't really go anywhere

1194
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
So now Alex is digging back taking this

1195
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,575
And that's the same article that

1196
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,623
Paul Joseph Watson opened with

1197
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
Some are saying

1198
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
Like he was very circumspect

1199
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
Expect about

1200
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Not makeup

1201
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
Not being like this is true

1202
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,607
I mean these are different articles but

1203
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Yeah

1204
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
A little bit of an ass

1205
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:39,359
This is the exact same situation with the present-day use the Rockefeller lockstep document this is a useful tool for

1206
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
People in the Air Force

1207
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,223
Educational program to explore what challenges the military May face

1208
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,527
If certain variables of social organization

1209
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
Can go different ways

1210
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
This isn't no way predicted

1211
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,183
I guess it's as predictive of the 2009 flu

1212
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
As it is of the UN dissolving in

1213
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
In 2010

1214
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
It's not an act

1215
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,655
Accident analysis coverage of both the H1 N1 flu outbreak and the president include

1216
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
Wheatley misrepresented document

1217
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
30 uses

1218
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,263
For knowledge on the part of his enemies

1219
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
It's because he's a liar with a pattern

1220
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
And he needs props

1221
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,407
Is The Carrot Top of liars

1222
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,711
It's at the point now where you like

1223
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,015
Do they have a flowchart somewhere

1224
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
Pandemic they've got break out the flowchart that I start here and then just keep going

1225
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,791
Down the Cascade of b******* that organized but I think it's just

1226
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:34,399
You know like that these are the elements that way to do it and got a pole from the way to do it

1227
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
So now let's Lubeck to this Coast to Coast

1228
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,543
I'm not going to make us sit here and listen to it all bit by bit

1229
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
But I could not help myself

1230
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,175
So I created a Supercut of some of the high points of the the episode

1231
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
Alex is on with

1232
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,039
Giant sea wrist and regular Jim Bakker guests

1233
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
Steve Quayle food like to eat

1234
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:56,927
Introduced the sex robot sure and he's one of the other you know Shady Infowars

1235
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Steve

1236
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,535
Like six and a half minutes long or so

1237
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,631
What does the only way I could boil down the experience of listening to this whole episode

1238
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
Monarch

1239
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
Flu scare

1240
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
Right here on Coast

1241
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
That is so

1242
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Far removed

1243
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
From

1244
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Teresita

1245
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
Air Force put out a doc

1246
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Painting bat bike

1247
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,695
1009

1248
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
30 million

1249
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
People would be

1250
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
They know that

1251
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
We just heard from

1252
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
To believe

1253
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167

1257
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
When we broke

1258
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
At Issaquah

1259
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
Infowars

1260
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
I'm about that

1261
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,439
In two

1262
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
An overload here but

1263
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Designer

1264

Virus

1265
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Clearly

1266
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Involved

1267
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
When you look at this

1268
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Out of

1269
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
I believe

1270
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Are they going to play

1271
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
So that's where we

1272
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Neon records

1273
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911

1274

On record

1275
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Like that

1276
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Happen

1277
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
This is a

1278
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
News story

1279
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151

To pick up

1282
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575

1285
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
Imagine

00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Love the world

1290
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Find out the bill

1291
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
This was a

1292
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Genetically

1293
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
Biologic

1294
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Was in

1295
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Instantly

1296
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Now those are my

1297
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
The scientist

1298
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Search that

1299
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Hours of the

1300
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999

1301
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Superbad

1302
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Better using this

1303
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
No it's not

1304
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Bad

1305
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
The unifier

1306
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Mexico

1307
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Believe

1308
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Typing it and using it

1309
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Corruption

1310
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
That's why

1311
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Right now

1312
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Episode in 20

1313
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Only forward

1314
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
For the president

1315
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
Shook the hands of somebody and

1316
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Call over

1317
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
You know he came down with

1318
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
The disease

1319
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
Very

1320
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Saturday

1321
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
Call Jonathan

1322
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Security

1323
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
We are in a total

1324
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Warm

1325
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
I believe

1326
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Symbolism in

1327
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Be more exact

1328
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Leave that you're seeing

1329
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,879
Implemented by

1330
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Powers Boothe

1331
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Car

1332
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Two ultimate

1333
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Wipeout men

1334
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
A pandemic

1335
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Flu would not

1336
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
Everybody

1337
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,375
After Time

1338
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,399
It's given his ever

1339
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
The time it's given

1340
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
I knew what was going on

1341
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
If Mexico

1342
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Waste

1343
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
And we're getting these report

1344
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
That is

1345
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,991
People

1346
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Don't know

1347
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Asians

1348
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Their backs when they're a baby

1349
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Asian

1350
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
With a mixture of

1351
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Bloodline

1352
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
Yes that's a big huh

1353
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Marvel

1354
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
I guess the

1355
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
Grouting a

1356
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Nothing to do with Spa

1357
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Play I can

1358
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
With how they was

1359
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
With this 10 congrats that's great Gorge active participant

1360
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,495
He sucks but like you see a couple things

1361
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
Like

1362
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,311
The nonsense aside

1363
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:15,967
A couple of other added elements are the knee-jerk continuation this is a race specific bioweapon

1364
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Play at the beginning

1365
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,295
The covid stop it's a very

1366
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,343
Standard feature of Alex's coverage

1367
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:27,231
And also the other thing too is the notion that this is meant to stop Revolution

1368
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Mexico

1369
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,839
Stop this Awakening against the the globalist tyranny

1370
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:36,959
It's exactly what he was saying about in China there were people who are rising up against the

1371
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,751
The CCP

1372
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
And it's got to be political

1373
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,199
King sad it makes me so sad

1374
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,527
I think you would be very sad mostly anytime you listen

1375
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
Dacosta cup

1376
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,879
That's true times it's fun but most of the time

1377
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,183
Here's what I'm saying

1378
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
Okay we don't need we don't need

1379
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Laws

1380
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
Restricting

1381
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,631
We need a bureau of enforcement of prediction

1382
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,495
Alright let me know so if you go on the radio and say some s*** that's

1383
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,823
You can say whatever you want on the radio but it up somewhere

1384
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
It goes on the board

1385
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
And there's a dick

1386
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
And if you contact tracing

1387
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,735
For bulshit like you have to follow up on E

1388
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Each prediction

1389
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,831
And then you have to come out and admit you learned something

1390
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,903
If you're Alex on this s***

1391
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,951
A2000

1392
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,303
Somebody comes into your office they go guess what it turns out you're full of s***

1393
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
To go on TV

1394
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,983
I do apologize and say I learned my lesson if you refused that you lose your prediction on there you go

1395
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,871
Just needs to be regulated we need regulated bulshit we don't need outlawed bulshit

1396
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:53,759
Picture though I support your your bill proposing

1397
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
I'm running for congress

1398
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,063
But like

1399
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,599
We should all be so lucky

1400
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
As Alex

1401
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,903
Stab friends

1402
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
Like all these Boynton our careers with

1403
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
White audiences that are willing to engage with our bulshit

1404
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
Narratives that he's pushing

1405
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
On the show with Jason

1406
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,703
And he's just

1407
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:18,079
Shined them up a tiny bit made them a little bit harder to track down exactly what he's talkin

1408
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
About Andy's disseminating 2m to George's

1409
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
Audience

1410
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,503
Android has a very willing active participant in it in the same way that Rogan

1411
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,807
Yep through negligence

1412
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
Or actually being interested in

1413
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,159
Spreading the Alex

1414
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Send it

1415
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
Outschool

1416
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
Exist without the

1417
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,791
Yeah I wouldn't be able to attract people

1418
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
To his b*******

1419
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,679
The dumb dumb who's willing to say that's interesting say more about that or

1420
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Haha

1421
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
You know weld all you have to do that's what they need

1422
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,407
Honestly I think never say say more about that because I never get any cheaper

1423
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,199
I'm interested in your topic

1424
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:00,063
Keep spewing bulshit you've interested me anymore

1425
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
Play yes that's what I

1426
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
So Alex left

1427
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
Bermas

1428
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,743
Because he had to take a nap or whatever shower to get ready to go

1429
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,815
I'll go check out

1430
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
We're going to jump back in

1431
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,143
On Saturday May 2nd

1432
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,191
Alex put out an emergency

1433
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
Alright hour long

1434
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
Special

1435

Animerge

1436

See

1437
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,359
Has ever done about this wine

1438
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,967
3232 the bullet points I've written here then I'll go to the news that backs it all up

1439
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,527
A huge mind control X

1440
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
Exercise

1441
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,855
A literal war on

1442
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,135
Freedom and liberty

1443
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
Worldwide estate

1444
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
Place

1445
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
And you can just Google

1446
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,071
Un says swine flu outbreak good for globalism

1447
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
Global essay

1448
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Flu outbreak

1449
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,471
Good for World Government you will see them in the news

1450
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,543
Bragging the dishes helping them set up a world governed

1451
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
They need a crisis

1452
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,359
The offer their solution

1453
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,431
Exactly where it is

1454
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Is Highway

1455
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
We do this

1456
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Enterprise

1457
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,575
Particular villain

1458
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:08,671
At this point and its leader security

1459
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Napolitano

1460
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
They love it

1461
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
They're also admitting themselves is

1462
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,351
Napolitano said last Sunday

1463
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
6 days ago

1464
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,471
Will probably fade out but another big pandemic

1465
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Will come

1466
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
Will happen

1467
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
Is a foregone conclusion

1468
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,615
So let's not forget about that

1469
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
And they're saying

1470
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
Images flu will probably mutate

1471
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:37,343
Ride around the fall in flu season begins we better all go roll up our sleeves

1472
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
Get the shop going to have right on time

1473
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
They're talking about

1474
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,999
The federal government paying for 600 million

1475
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,047
Joseph Humphrey terminal in America

1476
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Do you know how much

1477
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Prophet that is

1478
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,655
When they're talking about the drug companies

1479
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
The chosen

1480
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
As much as

1481
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
$20 for shot

1482
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
What's the

1483
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,359
What's 20 *

1484
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
600ml

1485
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,735
You can figure direct mirror of much of Alex's rhetoric and covid 2

1486
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,343
And the current day was Bill Gates saying that there be future diseases that Alex

1487
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
Theme to be suspicious

1488
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
What are the past it was

1489
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,487
And of course it's fear-based exercise

1490
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,279
It's another to get everyone to take Taxi

1491
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,607
Possibly just motivated by getting $20 per shot

1492
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,399
For lunch specials

1493
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
12 billion dollars

1494
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,751
That's a lot of money

1495
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
Especially to

1496
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:35,455
Trulia.com

1497
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,015
Absolutely so this is

1498
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
Staged man

1499
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,623
Understand the reason this is a dangerous

1500
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
The beta test

1501
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,951
As the economy continues to collapse

1502
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
We can

1503
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
Predicted this months ago their model

1504
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
Don't control will be stage biotech

1505
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,935
Datastage biotech in order to retain

1506
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,727
Control as the economy collapse

1507
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
This is

1508
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
So consist

1509
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,847
Love it

1510
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,919
You just keep hitting the exact same points

1511
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,247
This is clearly a designer virus we got to watch this is serious

1512
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,319
Because they may move on us right now with martial law

1513
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,367
Globalist argue Genesis

1514
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,951
McDonald's chemical biological radiological testing on us in the past

1515
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,511
We need to take what they're saying serious

1516
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
But we believe it's a hoax

1517
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Well

1518
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,143
He's now becoming more clear thank God it is a hoax

1519
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
The lesser of two evils because

1520
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
We know that it's a hoax

1521
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,335
For them beta testing their federalization their takeover

1522
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
And coming martial law

1523
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
What could be in the fall of the winter

1524
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
Of this year and early next year

1525
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,247
And they even admit their beta test

1526
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,855
We got clearly a designer virus erisa hammering that home

1527
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
And now we have this prediction that

1528
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,463
By the end of the year early into 2,000

1529
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
We got martial law

1530
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
None of this happened no

1531
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
The Bureau of enforcement needs to show up

1532
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,543
The reality is

1533
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,383
Played out in 2009

1534
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
Is

1535
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,991
Ideal almost for everybody right

1536
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
People got sick

1537
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,319
The way that it weekend

1538
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
And

1539
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
Became

1540
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Start of a flu

1541
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
A knot

1542
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,255
Some of it was necessarily more dangerous than than normal

1543
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
Hey that's great for the population

1544
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
But it's great for alley

1545
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Because he

1546
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
Can forget about all this b*******

1547
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:37,311
But it's going to be tough to forget about it now 2019

1548
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,127
20/20 2021 and now its 2022

1549
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,687
The presentation to Performance

1550
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,247
Surrounding code is not so far off of rails

1551
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,599
But it's going to be impossible

1552
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,671
But I'm making is

1553
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,207
What

1554
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,487
I believe

1555
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:01,375
I believe that he thought he was doing another one of these yet until he wasn't

1556
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,423
Yep by that point it was too late

1557
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
It's too late

1558
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,799
Yep you know it's almost like if you are Act

1559
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
Actively searching for bad governor

1560
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
And then you win

1561
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,223
And then something that needs good governance happens

1562
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:22,879
I think there's an under-appreciated at element for Alex that like his conspiracies legitimately rely

1563
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,159
Lion diesel governor

1564
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,279
Be things if what he wants to happen happens he

1565
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
Is f***** so he needs people to ignore him

1566
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,887
And give him money

1567
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
Which is a tough tightrope to walk

1568
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,263
Get sooner or later people are going to pay attention to you if you get enough money

1569
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
I'm here we are

1570
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,335
Subway

1571
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,895
Napolitano

1572
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:48,991
Sunday in

1573
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,551
Napolitano Homeland Security head

1574
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
Briefing

1575
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,111
She said to everybody out there

1576
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
He said

1577
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
There

1578
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,999
Is no need to shut down the Border or shut down and fly through anything

1579
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,815
Because it's already spread everywhere and there's no way to stop it anyways

1580
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,887
Besides Neuer worth

1581
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Coming in

1582
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
Break room

1583
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:13,311
This is an absolutely an accurate description of those comments that were made at the press conference

1584
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
Speaking of efforts of the Border she said quote

1585
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,687
We have implemented passive surveillance protocols to

1586
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,991
The screen individuals who may arrive at our borders

1587
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:25,855
All persons entering the United States from a location of human infection of swine flu will be

1588
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,671
Be processed through all appropriate CBP protocols

1589
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,719
Right now these are passive

1590
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
Means they're looking for people who asked

1591
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,119
Think about are you sick have you been sick and the like and if so

1592
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
Then they can be referred over for further examination

1593
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:45,055
Depart from that press conference that touches on the possibility of new strains popping up is not

1594
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
Napolitano but

1595
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,895
The comment made by the acting director of the CDC

1596
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175
Dr. Richard besser

1597
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,711
Spencer says quote

1598
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
We Analyze That

1599
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,575
Strain are continuing to do further analysis of Xtreme

1600
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,647
And we expect to see the emergence of new flu strain

1601
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
That's something that we are continually watching for it

1602
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,279
I'm sure they were ready should restrain emerge

1603
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:09,375
That's not that there's. Immunity and protection in the community for it

1604
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,959
This train is not unlike other new strains that have emerged

1605
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
It's an assortment it's

1606
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
Scott the genetic component

1607
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,799
From a number of sources

1608
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,847
Including human swine and avian sources

1609
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,151
And that's something that you see with noose

1610
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,711
Not that

1611
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:29,087
It's so it's so crazy that. Cuz I feel like this is a fundamental thing that hasn't

1612
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
Really been communicated to people

1613
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:35,743
Add to the level that I think a lot of people just assume other people understand it but

1614
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,047
But I mean viruses reproduce

1615
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,863
And they don't clown

1616
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:45,727
It's not exactly the same you'd like people to go on TV and be like okay

1617
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,263
You know how when you have kids

1618
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
Right they don't look exactly like you

1619
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,895
Get right and then if you have like a billion kids

1620
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,967
Eventually over a long enough. Of time

1621
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:02,367
They're going to look completely different from you this is like that but because viruses do it all in like a day they do

1622
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Do a billion of those in

1623
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,927
The day it happens faster

1624
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,999
Do you understand now it's just like us

1625
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
But it's a different thing

1626
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,327
Well I think even that isn't

1627
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:16,959
A good enough probably right you're really right honestly I think I think that

1628
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
You know

1629
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:22,079
The idea that you would have a and then once it transmits

1630
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,151
Still a

1631
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,943
Could be better

1632
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Reticulated

1633
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:34,111
Kind of what bastards point

1634
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
That there are combination

1635
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Sounds of things

1636
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Different sources

1637
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,231
Isn't something that is

1638
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,023
As surprising or weird as

1639
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
It may seem

1640
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,095
None of the comments that Alex describes

1641
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,423
Napolitano were accurate in the least but that doesn't really matter

1642
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
This isn't about reporting news or depicting reality

1643
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
This is my caracteriza

1644
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
Anime enf

1645
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Particular way

1646
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,615
They want the virus to spread

1647
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,479
Because doing so allows them before his vaccines on people and put in martial law so naturally

1648
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,783
Napolitano isn't closing the Border

1649
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,551
Intentionally

1650
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
To make a virus

1651
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
Spread bore

1652
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
The enemy wants the public

1653
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:12,511
2bm horrible fear so if course Napolitano ominously predicted new and worst strains of the flu

1654
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,559
Which Alex interprets essentially as a threat

1655
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:18,399
Just as he did with early Bill Gates interviews and the present

1656
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
One thing I should know that

1657
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
The looking at

1658
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
This discontent

1659
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,311
There's a tremendous overlap in terms

1660
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,615
The tactics of narrative elements that Alex is using

1661
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
There's a glaring difference

1662
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,991
Interpret the stuff that I reviewed for this episode I'm not saying he doesn't match

1663
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
Anywhere but

1664
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,343
All the stuff I looked at it doesn't bring up Bill Gates

1665
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,111
It's at all

1666
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,415
Weird diseases Bill Gates

1667
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
In the council 12

1668
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,255
In 2009 I think he was probably Middleman

1669
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:49,631
He's probably still very involved with world of Public Health

1670
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:56,031
You know you can't really involved when you got several billion dollars hanging around able to

1671
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
Direct his attention

1672
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,615
The government figures that he didn't like

1673
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
Bill Gates

1674
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Maybe wasn't nearly as much a

1675
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,711
An evil figure

1676
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:08,319
He had Obama yet Napolitano

1677
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Your billionaires

1678
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:15,487
Because you got the government the most evil one you've ever had before it's got a Obama there

1679
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:20,351
Makes more sense the idea that Obama would be able to put in Marshall R40 vaccine

1680
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,191
Where is the leap from Bill Gates be able to do that is a little tough

1681
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,263
Yeah you pull that off

1682
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,567
In the present day

1683
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,455
Not smoothly but he's done it and it helps that they've already created a massive mythology around Trump

1684
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,783
Divorcing him from the reality of who the person is to the point where you can

1685
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
You can say both

1686
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,599
He's the most powerful man on the Earth

1687
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:46,975
And he can't do anything about anything I do know he was tricks like this again

1688
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,279
Unstoppable can't do anything

1689
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
Here's some of the exact

1690
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,399
Same sort of rhetoric that we see in the present

1691
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:59,263
Republican by the phony Boogeyman terrorist in a cave

1692
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,567
We're all guilty

1693
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,639
The government gets to get involved in our lives and tell us what to do with

1694
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,919
Our body

1695
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Inoculated

1696
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,039
Inoculated to put us in prison we don't go along with what they say

1697
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,343
Florentina's Lockhart cities down

1698
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,903
Already beta testing with hotels in airports

1699
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,463
And some people's homes in Texas

1700
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Does the galifornia

1701
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
People are on quarantine

1702
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Police out front

1703
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
He think I'm on house arrest

1704
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,863
Actually tricked you that is eclipse

1705
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
From 2020

1706
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,703
It's not actually but it could have been you believe me

1707
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,567
No that's what could have been

1708
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,847
It would it's waiting is it

1709
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
It's 2000

1710
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
Debuted

1711
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:42,015
It's almost indistinguishable from a lot of stuff that used to think about

1712
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
Truly

1713
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
Absolutely

1714
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Wonder One

1715
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,391
Brutal

1716
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,695
It's it's very clear my name

1717
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
So

1718
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
Look there are people who are fear-mongering

1719
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
CNN

1720
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,583
There's other people who aren't

1721
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,631
Now here's an article not

1722
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
Fear-mongering

1723
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,727
Sign points to milder swine flu outbreak

1724
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,751
Sphere

1725
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
Don't tell CNN that

1726
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,591
I don't tell CNN cuz I got this one article

1727
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:11,199
Does Argos from Fox News that says is a Mach

1728
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
The article

1729
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,783
The quotes that are in it or from the very people Alex's

1730
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
Claiming are hyping this up

1731
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Fear-mongering

1732
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Princeton

1733
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,159
Dr. Nancy Cox a flu Chief at the

1734
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
CDC said cook

1735
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:25,791
We do not see the markers for virulence that we're seeing in the 1918 virus

1736
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,607
Hope all is sighted in that article is suggesting that the

1737
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,399
The flu may have run its course

1738
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
Like ordinary flus

1739
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,775
Alex wants to have his cake and eat it too any achieves this by crafting in Turkey

1740
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,567
Get stories based solely on Headline

1741
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,871
This box article is saying that the

1742
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,919
The signs are pointing to a milder flu than

1743
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Want to beard

1744
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,479
Just countered with the established

1745
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Meant to say

1746
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,575
But because he ignores the body of the article Alex doesn't have to attend

1747
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,927
Explain the fact that the article is based on comments from the people within the very establishment

1748
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,487
Protractor fear-mongering bring in March

1749
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
The law

1750
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
Also if you look at the coverage

1751
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,095
Of comments made by dr. Cox

1752
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,911
Find articles in NPR

1753
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:07,263
Who's titled flu Jean suggest virus not as deadly as 1918

1754
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,335
I guess what you can even find an article from CNN using

1755
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
The exact same quote

1756
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
There is a story that Alex wants to

1757
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:18,527
Hotel has no relationship to the reality in front of him which is why headlines are is most import

1758
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,367
They're often flashy in vaguely written either due to life

1759
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,927
Constraints or desire to drive clicks to website

1760
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,255
Unless they're really easy to misconstrue which is about

1761
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,559
75% of Alex's journalistic tool

1762
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,351
And you see that in the present

1763
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
You see that in the

1764
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:40,031
Yeah you do I mean you do have to give it up for those solid 18th century newspapers in

1765
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:46,431
Britain in the Lake Worth

1766
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
Yeah

1767
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
There is that

1768
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,879
Around the World in 80 Days has like those character titles

1769
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:59,743
Best cartoon

1770
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,303
Novel of a chapter title

1771
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,839
Ya solo

1772
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
Where are we I think

1773
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:10,751
I've made about a lot of the points that I wanted to make sure I hope to demonstrate with

1774
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:14,080
You see you see these exact same tricks

1775
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,640
A formula more or less play out

1776
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
That's where Alex used

1777
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,992
The beginning of the coverage of the covid pandemic

1778
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
That you see here

1779
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
With

1780
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
The 2009 H1 N1

1781
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,928
And now there's a little bit more to talk about but also this

1782
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,584
Special that he did ends up going off the rails a little bit something nice to enjoy

1783
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
European almost like dessert

1784
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,424
What's this song

1785
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
Instead This directly

1786
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:45,056
Even in 2009 and emergency Special Report

1787
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,384
That is an hour long

1788
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
On the topic

1789
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:53,248
Well I mean the topic is still more or less

1790
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Like

1791
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,600
Consistent throughout its about what he has an idea for something

1792
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,904
That actually is a lot of fun alright

1793
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:06,560
Okay let me go for the other knows I'm about to walk we're going to call the White House on Air I had to mention that we're going to call the White House myself on air

1794
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Coming up in a few minutes

1795
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,888
Then we're going to open up

1796
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,752
The martial law what they're selling what they're pushing why this is so important

1797
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,312
You're watching this in a month on YouTube

1798
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Music

1799
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,224
You call the White House too because they're planning to run this in the fall to winter

1800
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
31

1801
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
This is great training for us

1802
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,344
4th Ave North, the military takeover and locked

1803
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,672
Inoculations for your safety

1804
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,608
So you need to call Obama and the look Jack

1805
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:44,704
We know what you're doing we know you're using this as the economy implodes

1806
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
As an excuse to put troops on the streets and bringing martial law

1807
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,592
Inviting College Ron Jack

1808
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
You know I mean

1809
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:58,784
I think what would I do appreciate that is I would speak to the president of the United States that way sure

1810
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
Walgreens

1811
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
Jack Obama did sort of curate the images like I sit down and have a beer

1812
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,536
I think is anybody would be like

1813
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:15,168
I'm going to I'm going to allow people to come buddy or friend I ever had

1814
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
I think it would be Obama

1815
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,568
I think Nixon to take a swing at you I think Nixon depends on how drunk he was

1816
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Sherp

1817
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:28,736
Jfku get away with it

1818
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Well

1819
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
What we called

1820
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,088
Sure

1821
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,464
Anyway there are some other things that are parallels to before we get to the actual song

1822
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
Nnnn Bay admit

1823
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,560
Reuters AP that were

1824
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,120
This country and control their directing

1825
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,424
The response of the CDC in the states in North

1826
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,520
Gary Wertz his force inoculations that you have no rides

1827
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,336
You do read all this for yourself in that this link

1828
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,920
All week long up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com

1829
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,712
And imma give you the name of it

1830
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
It's

1831
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,296
Organization checklist for influenza pandemic

1832
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,368
Preparedness planning on that list all International laws and treaties

1833
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,160
Now that you this is real

1834
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,976
The United Nations really exist here it is right here

1835
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,280
Hey. Tell Glenn Beck this but

1836
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,656
This was a document that the WHL put together in 2000

1837
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,960
5 because of the avian flu outbreak

1838
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,568
This is not a list of Demands the World Health Organization is making of everybody

1839
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,128
A helpful guide to establishing best practice

1840
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:32,480
This is to be able to be ready to respond in the possible effect of a new flu strain emerging

1841
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:36,064
Where Health officials need to respond quickly to uncertain circumstance

1842
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:39,648
It doesn't list any treaties or whatever Alex is saying that's all the

1843
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,720
What is made up but we see here another direct parallel to

1844
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
To the present day

1845
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
It's important

1846
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,560
The Takeover plan the

1847
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,680
It's being facilitated by the outbreak is being run by the international globalist bodies that he imagined

1848
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,544
In this framework looks like Obama and Napolitano or bad

1849
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,896
But they're really just under the sway of these folks like The Whole30

1850
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,528
We seen that time and time again in terms of international cooperation

1851
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,320
The collaboration is presented as the

1852
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,624
World Health Organization ruling Over America

1853
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Can sovereignty

1854
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,464
That's a meaningless argument for Alex to make but it's

1855
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,280
A very good way for him to fear Monger to his audience

1856
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:22,144
It's been trained for years to be super afraid of the inevitable day when the UN and the international bodies were

1857
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
To take over the United

1858
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
He was doing that in 2009

1859
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
He's doing that

1860
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
Prior

1861
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Hurry up

1862
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,104
Another

1863
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
Maybe needs another

1864
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:36,224
Bridget from that the predictions board

1865
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
Just a one-trick pony

1866
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,296
Yeah I mean

1867
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,064
Sidetrack

1868
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Just sold

1869
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,160
It's so disappointing that it

1870
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
It still works

1871
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
You do you

1872
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:50,048
What year did you dream every if you spend enough time reading human history

1873
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,840
You dream of that

1874
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,144
Slow gross you know that like

1875
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,544
Lesson upon lesson we grow in WeChat brick-by-brick

1876
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,824
Book up in a new way

1877
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,224
You learned your lesson from that and you can do spirit and it turns out you can just do the same as yet

1878
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,504
30 years of being a millionaire

1879
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
Well as long as

1880
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
Do you have friends

1881
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,696
Like I already and Joe Rogan

1882
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,840
Nonno's in Richmond

1883
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,888
Never go wrong with them

1884
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,216
So anyway here's some more parallel to the present

1885
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Think about it

1886
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,568
Governments everywhere on the verge of falling

1887
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,384
Falling all over Eastern Europe they're falling all over the planet

1888
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
Because of the world implosion

1889
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,992
As they set up a new Bank of the world the new carbon tax

1890
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,344
Are they lockdown cities how do they set up a police state

1891
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,904
How do I ban public Gatherings have they banned protest

1892
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
How many grandstand to save

1893
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
Say hi Bob

1894
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
A designer fluid out of designer flu

1895
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
Scientist

1896
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Knuckleball

1897
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,376
Looked at it

1898
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,192
They would at least go yeah this is totally new and novel

1899
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,752
Looks like it's an engineer this is scary

1900
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,872
Fear

1901
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,480
Was something special they got for vaccine for the black man

1902
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,808
Does this type of stuff thousands of times

1903
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
The all of this

1904
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
Is

1905
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
Exactly

1906
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,672
I'm sounding like a broken record

1907
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:25,280
So Alex is going to build up to take

1908
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
Can call

The call to Obama

1911
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:36,800
Look at what's going on and call the White House. The number when calling the moment 20-24

01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
Revive shakes 1111

1913
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,408
These are just papacy's are just actors

1914
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,040
The real government is run out of the Rand Corporation and the Johnson Farm relation

1915
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,880
Brag they shut all the real policies

1916
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,416
The military dictatorship

1917
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm not in Virginia.

1918
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,048
Northcom

1919
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:04,960
Remember you're just crawling like a

1920
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,008
So don't be rude of these actors

1921
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
You know they work hard man they're tired

1922
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,640
But now they go home Obama smokes a cigarette

1923
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
Maybe it's a derby or something

1924
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:18,528
No he's a really good actor he presents the script

1925
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,880
Don't be rude let them know hey we know your actors

1926
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,952
And the people will back you up

1927

If you just won't stage Terror attacks are you know when your bosses take terror attack

1928
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,680
Tell your bosses we know their hyping this

1929
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:40,032
Sell the public important occupations in Roundup

1930
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,824
We know Obama

1931

I love the way they're going about it

1935
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
I think it's good advice

1936
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,832
Certainly

1937
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,648
You want to communicate with people if you want to reach

1938
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,952
Like I do understand

1939
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:02,304
You really see yourself working together with somebody when they approach you like that

1940
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
Listen I know everything that you're about to

1941
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:09,728
To tell me it's a lie and you're just an act because you're a f****** act there's no way for us

1942
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,312
To communicate a real way

Yep down there is the latest version of

2004
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:33,344
Presidential actor is this what you think leaving a message.

2005
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,672
Just call the White House and let the person answering the phone said you should give this

2006
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,512
To the higher-level while speechwriters and the people actually

2007
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,560
Riding the inscription plays

2008
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,096
For the actors

2009
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,704
The American people are aware that Obama and George Bush and all of them are just puppets

2010
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,240
Total new world order Papa

2011
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,824

Yqr

2014
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,968
Because this is the real world this is not a Shakespearean a thespian

2015
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:03,040
A Troupe of actors we are info Warriors

2016
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
In the Infowars supposing the New World Order

2017
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,368
This is also like

2018
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,928
Even if you was leaving a message this is

2019
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,720
Useful

2020
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,256
It's my specially a plug

2021
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,304
There's nobody there leaving

2022
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,120
A fake message that they plug for how great

2023
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,656
We're not off

2024
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,800
0 people but you're doing an emergency showed you usually are not

2025
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,592
If I had it this isn't life

2026
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,384
The show

2027
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
I was going to say because

2028
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,248
You could have edited out

2029
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,296
The part where you left a message

2030
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:40,160
2A not voicemail I think Alex is really into the authenticity of like

2031
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,928
No

2032
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:43,232
Just let him see it all

2033
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
But I mean

2034
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,536
Here's the thing

2035
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Okay

2036
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,144
Nobody told him

2037
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:54,240
Nobody but they don't take a message I didn't give him like a signal of like

2038
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,312
He called beforehand

2039
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:01,664
Before the show and they said that they didn't realize they don't

2040
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,224
Ava ancestry

2041
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,296
Well yes it is Saturday evening so they wouldn't have answered

2042
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,320
Either no

2043
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,368
But that doesn't stop him from

2044
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:16,768
Continuing I'm leaving a message voice

2045
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,048
It really puts the crazy

2046
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,096
Crazy parts

2047
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
We know you're not really even bad guys

2048
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
Your actors

2049
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Your Hired Guns

2050
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,008
To get out there and read off teleprompter

2051
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
We understand that

2052
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,848
But we're just saying that you was a puppet

2053
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
Since you actually talked

2054
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
To the bosses

2055
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,224
Abenaki and pulse

2056
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,504
Kashkari

2057
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,296
And Geithner and others

2058
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,880
We're just mid-level menus themselves to the Rockefellers and Rothschilds another

2059
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:47,232
We're not your slave we're not your property this is our Declaration of Independence

2060
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,048
My John Hancock I'm Alex Jones

2061
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,352
I want to sign my name

2062
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
Bisharp

2063
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,936
Simulcast on radio and TV

2064
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,728
I want the White House to know

2065
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,008
We are not putting up with

2066
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
Anymore

2067
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,336
I'm not your slave You Don't Own Me

2068
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,200
And you can stage all the bird flu swine flu crap you want to get involved in our lives

2069
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:13,600
Poses are saviors in our bosses and shutdown public assembly is collapsing from your new world order

2070
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,416
You guys did bring the drugs in together

2071
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,184
We know that the

2072
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,512
They staged this blue situation is a way to unify the people in

2073
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,560
Get folks more worried about surviving then

2074
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,096
Then I being slaves

2075
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:29,728
But just know this we're not cowards we're standing up to you we're speaking out against you where where

It's this

2078
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,616
We know you as actors

2079
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
Are aware that

2080
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:40,224
Real human beings real people who aren't buying it as a puppy

2081
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
Electrike

2082
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,344
Are beginning to wake up what you're doing and we're not looking at the puppet Obama

2083
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,392
The puppet bush

2084
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,720
Are the puppet Barbara Boxer we're looking past the Papas right now

2085
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,512
To the elite Mexican troll

2086
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:58,400
And Ron Paul's got bills to audit the criminal fed private Federal Reserve Atlanta

2087
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
Above all laws

2088
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,288
Onlar NewsHour no police no judge node branch of government can even look at it

2089
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,592
That's asinine exposing that

2090
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,920
We're going on at the fabric and abolish the fat just like Madoff

2091
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
Founder of the NASDAQ

2092
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,736

Our Eternal ideas go on forever and you can't stop the signal you can't stop the

2105

The truth but you should join Humanity you should stop selling out to these degenerate

2106
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,464
Old Potbelly European Rothschilds and Rockefellers

01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
It's disgusting

2108
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,536
The Joint Humanity White House

2109
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,304

I'm Alex Jones from Austin Texas

2112
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,984
I hope you listen to me

2113
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Wow

2114
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,224
Can I go long message if you'd like to go ahead and call up there ladies and gentlemen

2115
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:19,808
Oh my God

2116
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,112
What a

2117
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
What a Showman

2118
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
Ice

2119
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,440
If I was at the White House

2120
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
And I saw this

2121
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,024
The next add be like well we got to have a voicemail

2122
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:35,680
Maybe we got to keep that we got to keep these or actually I'd be like

2123
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,288
We did it would not allow you to leave a five-minute message

2124
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,848
I just say

2125
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,896
Alex probably Ed run out of things

2126
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,712
The cover I had planned

2127
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
This chunk

2128
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,016
And

2129
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,576
I got to do it I got to do something

2130
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:55,136
A stand-up and like

2131
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,720
A b not working Jerry got to finish it

2132
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,768
Power through

2133
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,632
This is really dumb but if you think about it this is also an analog to the present day

2134
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
These days

2135
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,216
Every important person in the world

2136
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,312
Comes to his shows we can just do full-on wrestling promos calling out people like Bill Gates

2137
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:18,944
And the audience gets to feel that vicarious excitement of pretending that Alex is talking directly to

2138
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
And telling truth

2139
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
The power

2140
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,784
You standing up to the tyrants and you're part of it

2141
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,576
In 2009

2142
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,928
Alex couldn't really pretend that anyone Empower cared all that much about what he was doing

2143
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:32,768
So this is how that same kind of vicarious thrill for the audience was convey

2144
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,168
How does pretending to leave a message on the White House comment line we're just drones on and on and declares independence

2145
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,216
Which is supposed to be like a thrill for the listeners

2146
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,520
It's pretending to take a risk

2147
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,616
Which is clearly illustrated by Alex pretending to sign something with his John Hancock

2148
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:54,272
This is meant to evoke the idea that the signers of the Declaration of Independence were taking a serious Risk by putting their names on paper

2149
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,856
Cause was unsuccessful they would be immediately killed

2150
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
For treason

2151
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,672
This is the same kind of risk Alex wants to

2152
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,208
Pretend he's taking by faker

2153
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,512
Leaving a voicemail for the White House

2154
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,840
I will say that it's kind of hard to tell which version of this is

2155
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,888
The sketch that he's doing is satyr like

2156
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:15,264
The version of the present or the past but I think it's probably the past because it requires the top

2157
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,544
Of the fake,

2158
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,568
Nightline message

2159
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
No

2160
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,152
Any any human being

2161
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:26,528
I don't know anybody even being who is gone straight from poetic irony to Poetic irony

2162
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
Unscathed

2163
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
I mean the man

2164
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,184
Literally left a voicemail to nowhere

2165
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:39,584
Perfect microcosm of his life and career

2166
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,120
Are you talkin to no one

2167
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,936
Unassuming that somebody there listening to him and not just

2168
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,336
Assuming nobody knows full well that no

2169
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
No one's listening he wants the audio

2170
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
Dance to believe

2171
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,944
That he is talking to

2172
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:59,040
A man walking from one poetic irony to the next

2173
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,344
Just like not even bothering to look

2174
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,416
The abyss don't even bother to look at him anymore if you miss

2175
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,976
Blowback

2176
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
This is over

2177
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:16,192
God I've got to get a beer

2178
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
Are we one last clip another parallel to the Press

2179
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
We want it happens video go viral

2180
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,384
People know this was all a mass hoax

2181
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:28,736
We hope they're still a small chance that it may turn out deadly but certainly engineered by

2182
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
Designer

2183
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:37,952
That is extremely viral check out all the facts check out all the evidence check out all the information that we went over

2184
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:44,096
Re-upping some of that fear a little bit and then trying to use it to promote

2185
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,144
You know you got to share all this information

2186
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:52,800
Got to make this go viral in order to protect everyone from the thing that I'm making you afraid of

2187
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,080
Is called that the actor

2188
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:59,456
For sale you know your clothes

2189
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:05,856
I understand maybe this is retreating some territory a little bit

2190
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,672
Inasmuch as I think that we've we've hinted at

2191
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,696
Talked a little bit about

2192
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,256
How some of this Dynamic works but

2193
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,560
I felt that it was worthwhile to look

2194
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,864
A little more closely at some of this

2195
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,192
This formulaic nature of

2196
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,728
The way that Alex presents

2197
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:22,752
His coverage

2198
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,568
Especially in the early stages of

2199
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:29,664
Pandemics or Republican

2200
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,224
That one of the things that I think is a limitation of this

2201
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,600
Is obviously later on down the road Alex will transition this into

2202
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,184
Swine flu vaccine is dangerous there

2203
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,744
Horrible side effects that are coming from the swine flu

2204
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,792
But it's almost impossible to

2205
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,072
To create a parallel

2206
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,352
How to how

2207
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:54,752
He ended up having to weave things with covid-19. In his career because he never been

2208
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,568
Stuck in that far out on a limb before

2209
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,104
You never was forced

2210
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,176
Do whatever he's doing now as it relates to

2211
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,456
The swine flu or

2212
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,992
To Ebola

2213
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:10,112
And I mean I guess I'm thankful for that because that means less pandemics got out of hand

2214
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,208
Is a limitation in terms of being able to trace

2215
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
Like

2216
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,792
This is the step that happens when your

2217
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,816
Forced to

2218
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,096
Right not move on

2219
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,120
Right I mean

2220
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,680
Awful part about alley

2221
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Is that his

2222
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,728
Type of

2223
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:31,616
Bulshit I guess can only flour in a stable environment

2224
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:37,504
One that doesn't fluctuate so far off course that it gives into any of his extreme bulshit

2225
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
And if

2226
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,600
He is allowed to flourish in a stable environment

2227
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,440
His presence will be a nun stabilizing aspect of it

2228
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,000
Which will then lead to where we are now

2229
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:51,072
A stable environment allows Alex to exist

2230
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,608
Allows him to grow to

2231
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
To the point where the on

2232
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,424
Stable environment takes over

2233
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:02,336
And then the cycle begins again

2234
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
For 30 years

2235
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:10,528
Well maybe we'll have learned better headlines

2236
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,808
Mudlogger

2237
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,344
That's the key

2238
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:20,512
Makita information traveling my contribution to the information Warfare

2239
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,096
Insisting the editors write longer and better headline

2240
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,400
Long headliner make very

2241
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,192
Clear what you're about to say

2242
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,984
But cannot be Miss cover

2243
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:36,384
Julie redundant to like to the Prairie Square even after they've explained their point they're like butts

2244
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,920
Seriously we're saying this

2245
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
Specifically

2246
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
Not other thing

2247
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,600
Anna like a breath Seas cough cough Alex

2248
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
Serious

2249
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
So we'll be back

2250
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:56,864
On Monday with look at dealing with his old buddies roads getting arrested

2251
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,704
Freeway and I bet it will not be great

2252
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,336
Since that news broke a little bit earlier and

2253
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
You know all of the

2254
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,176
People who are most instrumental in

2255
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:16,576
The rise of the Oath Keepers I don't think you can name somebody more

2256
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:21,952
Intimately entwined than Alex like he's been around since before

2257
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,512
They were an actual organization Stewart Roads

2258
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,584
Gaston Alex's show sent

2259
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:37,056
Announce that I believe so

2260
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,872
Germinated through Infowars

2261
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,456
So I can't imagine Alex taking this very lightly

2262
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:51,392
Up until then I always website

2263
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:56,768
5 - 8 Jordan Emilio and Leo albizzi Xbox

2264
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
And now here comes

2265
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
Sex robot

2266
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
Thanks for holding

2267
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:06,752
Alexandra Thurston color
