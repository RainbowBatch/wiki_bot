1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Today we are here to do another episode of this your podcast about

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,968
And what have you

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
That sounds like

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Times of Alex J will it really is a folk history about our modern times

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,584
Walk around all of Texas

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:40,704
Growing bigotry everywhere.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,288
A liar Johnny Appleseed

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
Alex Jones

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
The twist

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
What's

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,224
Like a chocolate Vanilla swirl

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Ice cream cones

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,808
Alright

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Tony Hawk

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
Finishing move

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Finishing move

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,280
No idea it was the special move in Tony Hawk

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
2

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
I don't know

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
Anywhere

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
I do not know anything about Alex

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
Today is we have a day in the life of

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
Bring to you

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
And we get to enjoy them all together today is a little bit

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Today

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
We're going to be discussing a special report

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,376
Alex put out a two-hour-long special report last Thursday

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
On March 30th

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
And I want to say that

31
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Alright

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288
It is a coincidence that I watched

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,200
I usually don't watch the Special Report

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
I usually only watch

35
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
The Alex Jones Show

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,184
Grocery store near me

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
What's your name I could have easily missed this and thank God I did

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,400
Because it's some of the most crazy s*** I've ever heard my life sound

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,216
Okay it's called

40
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
Special Report with Alex Jones

41
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Democratic plan

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Plan

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
To remove Donald Trump from office

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Alright

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
So basically

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
He set out to talk about

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
GOG

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Continuity-of-government

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Already a big fan of you sing

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Duke

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
What's or twice

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,448
Like like the Y2K episode

53
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,616
I want to get to the episode that I and our breakdown but I forgot we got to get to our out-of-context drop

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Termites

55
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Hell yeah

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,976
Doesn't tell him what to do

57
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Is baby

58
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,144
What's going on exactly what I say

59
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Drunk for 2 hours wasted

60
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
No doubt about it he recorded in the evening

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
9 at night

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
So I'll give you the broad Strokes

63
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,720
Drinking all day

64
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
The government is going to usurp Trump

65
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
Can't say on Mission

66
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
The first 15 minutes are boring as s***

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Of course you get to Rodger Stone in

68
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,080
And they have an interview 60 minutes

69
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
And Alex loses the chef

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
So we're not going to talk much about the Rodger Stone portion of the show

71
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Because quite honestly it's

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,368
Just the two of them doing like a wrestling shoot promo about like

73
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Come at me b**** trying to flex on the house intelligence committee

74
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
To arrive around the 17-minute mark

75
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
Alex Jones

76
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
It's probably my favorite clip

77
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
We've ever played on this show

78
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
I don't know how anything

79
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
I've listened to this

80
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
Conservative estimate 40 time

81
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
I am ready I am now let me tell

82
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Okay I love the gray fox

83
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
But Chef looks like the archetype

84
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
C*********

85
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
With those little deer in the headlight eye in all his stuff

86
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
And there's something about this

87
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,151
Hopping around bossing everybody around trying to intimidate people like me and you

88
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
I want to tell Congressman Schiff

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
And all the rest of them

90
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Hey listen a****** quit saying Rodger and I

91
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
You son of a b****

92
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
What the f***** your problem

93
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,399
You get my face without I'll beat your goddamn ass of a b**** you piece of s***

94
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
You f****** cross the line

95
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,127
Get that through your f****** head pushing your s***

96
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
You're the people that have this country over

97
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,887
Cusses like a f****** eight-year-old

98
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Discover how the word f*** works

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
The fact that he won can't pronounce archetypal

100
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Greatpeople

101
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,743
Fix connectivity.

102
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Does he not understand words

103
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
I think he doesn't understand how hateful

104
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Especially his words

105
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,263
How do I love that. I almost want to play it again

106
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
Just rewind the podcast let's do it again

107
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
Enter a speech tournament

108
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Pretender in high school

109
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Send to good that clip should be an indication of

110
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
20 years

111
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Non-Stop

112
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
Non-stop stream of invective

113
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Thrown around like an idiot

114
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Don't call me a Russian

115
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
I don't know I don't know if I have the clip of him saying this cuz I think it was surrounded by 9

116
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Nothing but he is like

117
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Absolutely not

118
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Like Rodger stone is sitting there while he's on this

119
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
This is wild Rogers

120
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Is a p****

121
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,279
Alex down the road today

122
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
August

123
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Like a threat

124
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Rodger Stone response is just

125
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,287
I don't think I've ever been involved in the campaign

126
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Bro

127
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
12:00 Offutt Hillary Clinton a Chinese agent

128
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Every time you're on the f****** show

129
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,647
He's questioned Barack Obama's legitimacy

130
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Patriotic

131
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
For China

132
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
I'm lovely

133
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
These guys

134
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Stupid

135
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
So crazy. Every time somebody

136
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Finally likes

137
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Received

138
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
What is the fair doing

139
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
They just lose their s*** and they

140
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Can't make that

141
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Small connection from

142
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
When somebody says this

143
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
I wonder if other people feel this way

144
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
When I say that they just can't do it

145
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Little jump

146
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
All you have to do

147
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Stop for 1 second

148
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
Meanwhile later on we're going to get into Alex really going hard about how everyone hates him

149
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Because he loves everyone

150
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,407
Empathy argument for later

151
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Alex

152
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
Swearing and running his mouth which is followed up by there

153
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
Pisses me off man down

154
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,135
Violation of Center rolls

155
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Is is a violation of the rules I get

156
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,583
Again in reference to John McCain talk about Rand Paul

157
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
Rules

158
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
We would never insist

159
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:23,615
That Russians infiltrate our government

160
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
Left Emily not violating rules

161
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
Everybody needs to go one by one down that little outfit you have on air

162
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,695
Portasoft

163
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
It's not like we don't support the

164
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Most corrupt

165
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Ministration

166
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
United States

167
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
The contacts

168
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
This is about John McCain

169
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
In Russia

170
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Interesting euthanasia

171
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Russia on the senate floor

172
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Against the rules

173
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
Some conservative

174
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
The question the patriotism of some liberal

175
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,535
Believe me the said it would being high.

176
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Exactly right thank you should have been because she broke

177
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
So important

178
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
I really hate it I hate

179
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
I hate the calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas

180
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
That's entirely possible was she ever centered on the senate floor

181
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
101 watch Pocahontas 2

182
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,047
Gives up a little bit of insight into why Alex might be this drunk

183
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Fall Apart

184
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
Over the past couple months

185
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
And this is just

186
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Pure

187
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Abject

188
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,063
He's hitting board sort of roadblocks and Hazards than mr. Magoo

189
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,951
Like he's just he's blindly stumbling through

190
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
You f***** up your your ads are gone now

191
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
So you got another

192
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Piece of bad news

193
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Clearly

194
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Before this one

195
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
I'm going to theorize

196
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Started his drinking

197
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
What I'm going to describe as one of the saddest sales pitches I've ever heard Rodger Stone

198
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
News on Skype anything's background like some soda

199
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Floating head

200
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
What's the name of that like Bo

201
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
The guy who would give them missions on Power Ranger

202
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,583
V

203
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,215
Another one

204
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Rodger Stone looks like

205
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
Thousand

206
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
4-channel least do millions of their blocking us

207
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,831
Knowing your own Facebook page going your own whatever is Rodger Stone

208
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
This is the information I don't want you to ask infowars.com live show

209
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
Infowars.com live show

210
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:27,423
Real Alex Jones whatever

211
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Trailways Rodger Stone

212
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
We're moving forward

213
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,871
I just understand that I'm up here at 9:27

214
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,455
I'm so honored

215
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,319
Chubby here but just understand its people shopping and it for store.com

216
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,399
It was four years ago that we're putting on iodine supplements Ignacio boards everywhere

217
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
Because we have people

218
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Basically doing industrial sabotage blockers

219
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
Because you can be used to make a bunch of stuff

220
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
Element

221
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Okay

222
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Restraining illegal

223
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
But you get their crystals

224
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
From Jeepers mining

225
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
That's something only

226
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,471
Drug companies

227
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,079
It's really important.

228
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
At this point

229
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
At this point we haven't gotten

230
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
To really the bad news portion of it yet

231
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Just going on

232
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
Just become

233
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Pretty

234
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,183
So powerful

235
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
We have

236
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
We had this for years I've had some of the biggest companies out there, try to buy it from us

237
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
And

238
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,151
They wanted us to then be able to just put in shampoo

239
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Real Gone

240
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
It's a distillate or a derivative or

241
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,863
You know something else that yet sometimes like oils at 6,000 ft I get that little side shooting

242
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Shepherd

243
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Robert Townsend

244
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Talking about fair warning

245
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Selfish

246
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
8 minutes long

247
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,487
He still hasn't gotten to the bad-news portion of it to

248
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,351
He's taking a powder

249
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Staring into

250
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
Camera middle-distance Fairfax Boulevard

251
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Least-liked walk on and off

252
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
The screen from time to time you can't tell cuz most of the time the cameras on Alex he's just giving like an empath

253
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Disability

254
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Call Rob

255
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
Bullets for everyone

256
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Falling asleep and then

257
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,191
Waking up in the middle of the story

258
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
Yep God exist

259
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Is

260
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Maybe

261
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
35 minutes

262
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
The two hours

263
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
And

264
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
I have documented evidence that he was drinking

265
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Throughout the two hours

266
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
You treated at the picture

267
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
I found pictures and I also like playing

268
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
That made me realize that he's drinking

269
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
Is Rodger Stones video is on

270
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
You can hear him flirt

271
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
You can hear a gulp sound effects into the mic

272
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
No I want to be totally clear we're drinking champagne and we're up front about the differences were honest about it

273
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
And we're not missile lining

274
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Every minority

275
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
What one of those two things is more important than the other but we're doing but they work together to make us in the clear

276
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
For drinking on our podcast

277
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Secret drinking

278
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
And trying to get everyone to be scared of Muslim

279
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
I've never been drunk enough

280
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Geologist

281
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Most families done at military

282
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Family business

283
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Here is

284
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Hydrolysis Texas

285
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Is that

286
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
We have the last shipment coming up

287
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
About to sell out of one more shipments coming in 20000 bottles normally last 6 months

288
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,367
And now they found out

289
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Fonte

290
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
I will let the mother like Rodger that and also the senator attacking Rodger

291
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
And so

292
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
They try to shut us down getting the distillate from seaweed to still DEA control cuz it's 999

293
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Jennifer you want the 9999 you know how to infinity bracelet

294
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,695
You did

295
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,303
The globalist Soros

296
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
We don't want

297
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Behind the scenes State even had

298
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,335
My people are like look leave it alone we're probably going to fix it don't make any shoe

00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
The whole backstory I will if I have to but

302
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
This may be the last shipment we get of this

303
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Nobody else has got deeper Crystal forces

304
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
I'm still 30% off

305
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,103
Progressive that off

00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,919

307
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
XX

308
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,599
I don't know which side I'm going to come down on and believe

309
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
I think it was probably just a market

310
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Turn slightly and they're going to

311
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
They're trying to charge him more

312
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
For it

313
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Exclamation

314
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,239
Suppliers are being threatened and s*** like that

315
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
We do have to listen to the rest

316
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
I thought

317
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,223
Cut it we have to listen to rest of this cuz that's where it gets into people being threat

318
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,952
Why do we need

319
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,792
Purest

320
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Do you think anybody would notice

321
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920

322
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Everybody

323
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832

324
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,720
Sales pitch cliff

325
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536

In the snow

340

When you get Rodger Stones bucket give it to somebody that don't know the truth are you get a t-shirt

341
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808

A really good product

345
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
DeSean Jackson

346
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,216

This is obviously Larry C Johnson

350
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah that was not a

351
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,720
No use a discredited of rumormonger race-baiter

352
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Horrible piece of s***

353
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
In essence

354
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
That's the shorthand for the

355
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
You know call him out by name but it will happen with Larry Johnson

356
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
He's about to get kicked out by Alex

357
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480

I can't come on anymore if they're threatening my business and my family this guy was a section chief

359
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
The world

360
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
Start threatening him so bad for coming on supporting Trump

361
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
He's rolling over and it's white

362
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
It makes you feel really cold

363
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
It makes you feel alone I'm not saying he's not a man and not tough

364
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,128
It's just like

365
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,736
But this death is rolling over to these people

366
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
It pisses me off when they

00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232

Drunk person

372
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,992
I've been this guy so many times

373
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
But I've been smart enough

374
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Not to be on

375
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Erase baiting

376
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Political talk show that I have started

377
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,536
Wow I

378
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,264
Did you ever consider that they don't cover any new topics in this two-hour broadcast

379
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Hotwire

380
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
But there's no reason to have done in the first place

381
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Clearly

382
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
To make this

383
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Sales pitch

384
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
What about using your language

385
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
He sped up to do with it

386
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Instead of doing that thing

387
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Keep walking

388
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,960
I think there was still a part of him that. Like alright we are going to cover the Coggs

389
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Will get a lot of plugs in on the way

390
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
I'll scare people that won't have iodine anymore

391
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Amanda Jones

392
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Got a got a cookout

393
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
No one

394
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,904
Why would anybody threatened or maybe Larry Johnson

395
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
This is not good

396
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,304
And I don't want those negative parts of Larry Johnson

397
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
What people have forgotten about

398
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
And the fact

399
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
Judy's not allowed

400
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:21,568
On cable news shows anymore

401
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Doesn't get a lot of bad

402
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Publicity

403
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
Kiko's on Infowars

404
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,040
And all that stuff comes back up negative tweet

405
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
I'll be looking like you're a liar and a race-baiter

406
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
F*** is wrong with you

407
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,256
Imagine that

408
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,840
So there was some attention

409
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
You are the only person that watches info and whoever

410
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
I swear

411
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Nobody else's

412
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Watch the show

413
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,736
And this is just some weird kind of

414
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:08,160
Experiments that Stanford

415
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,280
You're the test subject

416
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
I think that's what happened

417
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,424
Brought back up to him he doesn't like it so Alex's ass

418
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,848
You know what that was negative for me I don't want to do it now it's can't handle that

419
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,016
The globalist must have gotten to her and Rodger Stone

420
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Or Superman

421
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Their Shadow Boxing

422
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
With a non-existent anime

423
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
The globalist

424
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Edit really easy for them

425
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Alright

426
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
They're finally they seem to be going down

427
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Just because

428
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
The globalists have

429
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
There I on Alex Jones

430
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
In the past does not necessarily mean

431
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
They are not turning

432
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,880
Also this week is accused of being of Transylvania in stock

433
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,376
I don't want to ask this question cuz I see you

434
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
Alright

435
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Transylvania real

436
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Israel

437
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
You know what I mean

438
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
And you know that you know he doesn't

439
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,368
He does not know the Transylvania is a real place

440
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
He's a real place stinks Transylvania the country probably

441
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
He picks the Transylvania exist

442
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
Open the world

443
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
The dark lord Dracula

444
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Excellent

445
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,384
They're chopping them off right in front of me

446
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
I could have sold who wants power over people

447
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,600
Call Alex Padilla

448
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
Kick your ass outside

449
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
Adjectives

450
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
6 ft tall

451
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,384
Flip flop three grades model weigh 200 lb

452
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,480
Diverticulitis 140 lb person I crawled on top of him

453
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Nocatee.

454
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
All the way

455
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,048
He better not find out about our shell

456
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Also did you notice that

457
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
The phrasing in there really strongly implies that he's put multiple people in Tacoma

458
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
Normally I would say

459
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
Exaggerating

460
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
This strange thing there was

461
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
Really long pause

462
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,112
Like suddenly

463
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Maybe I shouldn't have done

464
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:26,048
Baby this is not the right road to go downtown

465
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,864
People that are

466
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
One hand

467
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
According to his story

468
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
And I don't

469
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Disagree that someone

470
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
You should stand up to a bully

471
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
I don't think you should be proud

472
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
Strong indication that he has no ability to control his temper

473
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
He's beaten

474
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
And with the crowd

475
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
You put this guy in a coma and then

476
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,584
Tacoma

477
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,192
And that led to

478
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
Family fuk up

479
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Situation

480
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Is mental illness which

481
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
We don't know what it is

482
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
But if it's clearance

483
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
I quit

484
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,704
Every every idea of normal or saying I have

485
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
If it is also applied to him I am I mean

486
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
Just at this particular in

487
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Begin that like it's

488
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
Real toxic masculinity

489
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
Fetishizing of violence

490
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Incredibly stupid

491
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Well yeah

492
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Cox

493
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,280
Alex Jones

494
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
And it's not

495
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,824
These agencies and Groves don't reach out don't do things

496
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
For PR purposes

497
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,944
It's because they're risking their lives even talking to me

498
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
About 30% of the CIA

499
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
All the guys that do The Killing

500
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
Casey Johnson

501
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
Night

502
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
Percent agency

503
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
This debate

504
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,056
But they said that the guys who do The Killing

505
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Love Trump

506
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,712
Don't you think if the guys who do the killing love because

507
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
They're going to do more to like if you really break I don't know

508
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,720
Sickly what the ratio of Those Who Kill and those who don't

509
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Agency

510
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Slow on the kill site

511
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
Okay

512
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Although although

513
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,448
Ghetto it is one of those things

514
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Franklin

515
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Everybody

516
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Is a murderer

517
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Would you say maybe 50 50

518
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,944
I would say there's no way that the support structure is equal to

519
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Doing the Killer

520
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:30,368
Cluding drones in the doing the killer I think you talkin about

521
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Dirt bike 150 me the number for movies

522
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
The Killing

523
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
20 dozen

524
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Got real mad

525
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,384
Elvis's Rock rages Channel Improvement

526
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
90%

527
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,784
That 80% because the killing for truck

528
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
20%

529
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,232
So then in order for all of its percent

530
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
I have to mean

531
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
That more than 90% of that 80%

532
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
I am not more than 90%

533
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
It still got to be like

534
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
70%

535
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
In order to compensate

536
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,640
Who cares what a map is really struggling

537
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,040
It is his argument that 90% of the people who do The Killing

538
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
Trump

539
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,368
80% of the total

540
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Support Trump

541
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Beans

542
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
Well that's majority of the analyst also support Trump

543
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
These numbers are fake

544
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,912
Be possible

545
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
Is that I talked to folks either all over

546
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,824
The Special Operations Command everything

547
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
I've been on the fence before

548
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,808
Republican

549
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,208
Approve Trump's wall

550
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
How is How is

551
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Possible

552
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
How is that possible that you

553
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
That you make that

554
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Because

555
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
It's like like

556
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Trump

557
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Sad

558
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm going to let Obamacare fail

559
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
Intentionally

560
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:35,552
Because

561
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
Like they're not

562
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
There's 200 even

563
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,280
White did it in the first place if this is just a natural

564
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,424
Elise cowardly

565
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Dispute

566
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Intention

Prosperity

568
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
He talks about

569
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,296
These small business optimism index

570
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Thanks

571
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
I found this

572
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Statistics that he

573
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Statistic

574
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
National Federation of in

575
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Independent businesses

576
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
Small business index

577
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,920
I don't believe that the March 10th

578
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
But you should tell her that audio

579
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
I think it's like

580
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
Like 20-something

581
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Statistical point

582
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
They analyzed

583
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Of small businesses like

584
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
They're plants in Greece

585
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
Employment plans to make Capital outlays plants

586
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Inventory

587
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,704
Current inventory

588
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
How businesses

589
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
And how they think they're going to be doing in the future

590
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
In February

591
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
The optimism index

592
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Drop point six point

593
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
But it still

594
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,784
Really high 1.1

595
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,928
Actually I mean that's really good you look at the numbers around the election

596
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
2105

597
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:27,168
Because of Trumps like we're going to get we're going to get rid of the factory have to pay for your employees insurance

598
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,984
Things like that that makes businesses optimistic

599
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
So it's not necessary

600
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,664
No employees are very very not out to visit cuz they want insurance

601
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,016
It's good to have and they want protection

602
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
Great thing that they

603
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
How they cannot make even the

604
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Latest

605
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,488
Between

606
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
When it's super low

607
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
And then Trump taking over

608
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
When it's super hot

609
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
In the meantime

610
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,984
Something may have happened

611
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Is what we can talk about

612
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
The stock market rise

613
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
This I think is directly related to

614
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
Small jumpers directly related

615
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Where do you think it was in 2000

616
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,904
Back to 2000

617
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,512
The claim that it's the highest it's ever been since patently false

618
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,144
It was as high or higher is almost like 107

619
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
So

620
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
The optimism was even higher

621
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,872
Now there's a little bit down and like 2008/2009

622
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
What Market was falling apart

623
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,040
Way down I'm looking at it right around like 81

624
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
And then

625
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:53,696
There was a progress

626
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
Does natural Epsom salt Epsom Downs

627
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,912
Dramatically

628
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,480
It's it's a it's a projection of

629
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
The concept of how

630
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
And that's

631
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
It is kind of

632
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
A silly thing

633
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
Because

634
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
These people

635
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
You go well

636
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
And they think it's going to

637
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,888
Wilshire and components

638
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Of the small business

639
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
Optimism

640
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Index

641
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
Like if you look at the individual pieces

642
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
Here's where we are for February 2017

643
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
Businesses that plan to increase employment

644
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Is it 15%

645
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
Which is down

646
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
From where

647
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Time they took the measurement

648
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
January

649
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Plants

650
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,232
Is it

651
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
3%

652
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:04,352
The business is actually concrete growing is only at 3%

653
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,168
Which is up 1% from January but

654
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,008
And I whatever

655
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,128
Sales to be higher down 3%

656
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,944
Now is a good time to expand

657
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
3%

658
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
Caters of like

659
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,624
Actual optimism are going downwards

660
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
So

661
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Everybody

662
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
Does an artificial optimism

663
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Earnings

664
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
He's lied

665
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
The people who voted for

666
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Mobile

667
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,224
LV Small Business Association

668
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,552

669
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576

Protestant bible thumper

673
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Diamond we see it happening

674
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,312
70 days into office

675
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
All these assholes

676
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,504
Killing your mouth off about

677
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
That wrote the book on

678
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,672
Can you speak about that continuum

679
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
Brought up

680
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:40,864
Some of the things we talked about and just

681
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,192
And trucks were made you know about put the Army around the house but

682
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,080
You know.

683
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,687
What does Trump need to do to stop.

684
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,991
It's Criminal

685
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,319
Not to stop major media organizing

686
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,903
Little Albert

687
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
That's not happening

688
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,999
That's not what Trump

689
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Start by being honest

690
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
And then resign

691
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,055
Stop

692
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
But also

693
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Ourselves

694
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
This is all a question

695
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
This is all set up a question

696
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,183
I don't want

697
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,535
Kevin just gloves are coming off bro

698
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
Because he's people

699
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:56,127
It's counting down here man punch me in my family

700
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
Without the

701
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,599
Are you

702
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
You hold it all back

703
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:19,679
No

704
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
We let them start

705
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Cuz I don't want

706
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
He doesn't want

707
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,943
You know what I started to come around on a new series at Alex

708
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Explain in person

709
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
I think Alex

710
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Desperately want

711
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
Drop to get impeached

712
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Forsyth

713
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
That is only the only

714
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
He

715
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
You know how we talked about how he didn't want Trump to win

716
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,351
I'm going back on that I think you did want him to win

717
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,703
But since he's one he started to realize

718
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
He's starting to realize that all of his narratives are busted

719
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Every single

720
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
Statistically quotes is wrong

721
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
Stories that he site

722
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
Don't say what he thinks it says

723
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,735
It's becoming impossible for him to defend

724
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
People like Flynn

725
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
We have to bend in the past

726
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Is it possible

727
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Nunez at this point

728
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,511
Dennis Montgomery Road

729
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
Isn't

730
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Frustrated

731
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,215
Canvas and already so I can twist the narrative

732
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
He doesn't know how to win

733
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
It's not that though I don't think

734
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,175
I don't think the winning is the problem I think it's the being

735
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
Being attached

736
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Do this thing

737
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
This this tumor on the side of him

738
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
Is so counter 27

739
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Growing out of it

740
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
Watchmen

741
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,335
I can open a beer about it

742
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,175
That already dated reference

743
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
Just say the word fetty wap on it at one time

744
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
Please make a video where you fix it

745
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:16,671
Trump then we could get all my God I can't

746
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:22,303
I can't imagine how he mispronounced it Raceway

747
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
I think it is

748
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
The only one who's talking about Trump being assassinated

749
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Really far-out people

750
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
No One support

751
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,575
Even though the writing on the wall

752
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,135
Need to talk about that he's going to

753
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,863
Really at this point with this type of person would only hurt you

754
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
Against the person like this

755
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
If you kill them

756
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,567
Is for Trump to go down it

757
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
The probably pretty likely

758
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
Presents

759
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
Or I want all of his money taken away

760
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Popper

761
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
And we bring back

762
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,391
And we all go

763
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
Get to throw one tomato at

764
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,583
Just like just like my Siri is are just like my prescription for Richard Spencer and

765
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
You got one pot

766
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,263
Is the punishment for treason instead of

767
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
Dillingham

768
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Punishment

769
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,295
I think

770
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
The archetypical Cox account just line up every citizen every illegal

771
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Just punch you in the gut

772
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,863
See now that's that's not a good idea that you just laid a trap for illegal immigrants

773
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,263
But now we know where they are what's wrong with you

774
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,871
Immigrant

775
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:17,503
Horrible thing could have backfired into a even more horrible thing

776
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Like any of them

777
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:25,951
Rodger Stone before we get into uncharted waters with Alex Jones

778
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:31,327
Rodger Stone on Friday was on Bill Maher he was on real time

779
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,631
Belmar

780
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
F****** idiot

781
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
Is a f******

782
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
Staying islamophobe

783
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:47,967
He is the worst the most recent Chris Hayes

784
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:55,391
If you watched most of it

785
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,463
I'd like Louise Mensch is on

786
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,767
Largely

787
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
F****** conspiracy theorist

788
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,423
Not in the same vein as a lot of people like

789
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,983
Conspiracy theory

790
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
It fair to paint her with the same brush

791
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
But I will say that if

792
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,407
If you want any kind of journalistic integrity

793
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
You definitely don't

794
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
That's fair

795
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:27,391
I don't want to unpack all that I'm not going to go to bat for her

796
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Alex Jones Show

797
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
So

798
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
Garages for Alex Jones listeners the same podcast

799
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,751
Who was the one who was talking about how

800
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,591
They're terrible

801
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
I don't know anyway that was like

802
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,455
This week Rodger stone is on and that's why he's got go to bed bed

803
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
And leave Alex

804
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
At this point

805
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
Alex

806
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Cox outage

807
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,951
Stone to Bill Maher but then also

808
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,071
He's got bigger balls than

809
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Mark Warner

810
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
But they tape it live he hates Infowars

811
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
94.com we're winning

812
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,903
I want to see if that gets in there so promise me you'll do that right

813
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
You got it you have my promise

814
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,791
Rogers town I don't know I didn't watch it

815
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,351
Do you know that

816
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Piano

817
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,215
Pathetic

818
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,151
Doing great please

819
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:57,503
So at this point Rodger Stone go to bed bed cuz he's a seventy-year-old man

820
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Should have stopped

821
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,487
God because I found

822
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
And how stupid he's been up to this point

823
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,607
Without Rodger Stone to ground him

824
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
He is

825
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Losing it

826
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,007
The rest of this episode

827
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
These clips

828
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
Somewhat

829
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,223
Hard to figure out what I'm talking about

830
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,111
This is what is right after Rodger sound

831
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:39,999
Okay immediately

832
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,351
Nothing nothing

833
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,935
Nothing that would make this make sense

834
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
So here we go

835
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,543
Money is literally like a video game

836
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,895
Fighting the big boss

837
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
Money literally I mean

838
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Why do I have a Dodge Hellcat

839
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,159
I've never bought in my life of $63,000 Bill

840
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,559
Banks around like $25,000 for trucks they're awesome

841
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
That's all I need

842
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:21,215
Looks like Ferrari makes this now and it's 700 horsepower

843
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
And it's America

844
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
That's not what her are you

845
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
Also these Clauses he's burping

846
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,271
What are we

847
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,367
He loves his whiskey

848
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,207
I don't want to share that with him

849
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,607
Because everyone I know.

850
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
I could see that

851
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Doesn't

852
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
Drink Scotch

853
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
No

854
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:05,759
I don't remember I know the Joe Rogan mentioned what it was when he was on the road

855
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Experience

856
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
Bravo talks about how he was drinking before the episodes

857
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:22,143
A picture of

858
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Lucy Oliver

859
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
B

860
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
But he's done

861
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Talk about cars

862
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Fact that I want this

863
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
Dodge Hellcat

864
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Challenger

865
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
Because it was you couldn't

866
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
You couldn't get a car

867
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
For $300,000

868
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,023
Million-dollar Ferrari that's fast

869
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
But it wasn't he one of the patch car

870
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
So fast

871
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
Horsepower

872
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
It was that was so Americana

873
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Okay

874
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
And so anti algor but also because it was black

875
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
And just look like a regular

876
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
Challenger

877
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,671
Daddy likes fit into my cosmology

878
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,791
A race car but it is

879
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,375
Also what are you tracking

880
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,935
America

881
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Is everybody knows

882
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,055
Dodge Challengers Americans

883
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
Dream of buying a Dodge

884
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
Challenge

885
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
It's in the Constitution

886
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,719
But I do like that

887
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,351
It doesn't look like it's erased his cosmology

888
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Of things

889
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,423
Not appearing to be what they are

890
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Cosmology

891
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,567
What I think he means is his life's philosophy

892
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
Mars in

893
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,551
No but I think what he's trying to say is that his life is

894
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,135
Predicated on the belief that things aren't what they appear.

895
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,999
Okay and if he was trying to say that

896
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,655
Exegesis

897
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,775
Credit than he has ever deserve

898
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:42,687
Crazy man on the train

899
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
I have to at least try and pour sound like

900
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,951
And I would agree with him that his life is about that but not in the way he think

901
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999
You saying that

902
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
I see the hidden reality behind

903
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Things

904
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
For the truth is like

905
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,911
You are not what you appear to be

906
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,751
You appear to be a conservative talk show host

907
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,079
And you're out now traven propaganda

908
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,639
So I kind of get it

909
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
Is that what he said

910
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,527
Again it might be the twin coming out to e.r.

911
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,695
A part of him that is desperately wanting to come clean

912
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
How far does he go

913
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,631
Before he actually does

914
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Come clean

915
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
No

916
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,239
He finally

917
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
Fully taken down

918
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
And he sits there going

919
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
We're shuttering the door

920
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,223
And I refuse to rhyme that with whatever the name of the show or website

921
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,551
I think you have to have

922
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,879
Excessive lawsuits

923
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
Or something like that

924
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,975
Cuz it would take more than Glenn Beck

925
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Like

926
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
He's going to flame out

927
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Absolutely

928
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,175
Drunkenness is not going to help

929
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
For some positive to your question

930
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
I think the

931
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
He's

932
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
At this point

933
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
If I

934
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
If I know Alex like I think I do

935
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,863
I think he is in a battle

936
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
Between

937
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,423
Not being able to

938
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Carry the load anymore

939
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
And how guilty

940
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
He feels

941
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
About

942
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,799
Selling out glass

943
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
20 years of his quota

944
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
For Trump

945
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
To go down

946
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
I think that's what he's due

947
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,831
Little bit

948
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
The Narrative of flip

949
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
And that's why

950
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
The next episode

951
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Massively about pizza

952
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,535
Yeah whole situation with him

953
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,815
And I think that

954
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,119
I think

955
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
With Dennis Montgomery stuff

956
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
With one attempt

957
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,031
Triumph the narrative

958
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Everything will be fine

959
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
You can't do that there's no legs.

960
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
So now he's going like

961
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
I'm going to be a crusader against pedophilia

962
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
And maybe

963
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
For a bit

964
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
I think buying time

965
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
So he doesn't

966
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
Have to face them

967
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,487
I might be pregnant again I might give it to my brother

968
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,351
To me it seems like he doesn't have good

969
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
People

970
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Talking to

971
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,007
Because of the because of that earlier Clippers like

972
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,943
Low-level employees like

973
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Dude

974
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
We can still make

975
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Get through this

976
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,039
Chill

977
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
You

978
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
A little while

979
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:12,607
We'll get back we'll get right back to being in the spotlight will get I'm a hundred percent guessing it's raw

980
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Rodger Stone

981
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
And Jerome Court

982
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:33,599
Other person in the studio

983
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,671
Alex Alex

984
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:40,511
Alex's talking and facing the other direction

985
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,607
That's so beautiful I can't imagine Paul Joseph Watson

986
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:50,495
Has any advice to give them

987
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:58,943
Right

988
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
They're still around

989
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
Eddie never mentioned that be

990
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,023
Some reports

991
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,583
Biggs on Twitter

992
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Pennywise

993
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
Exposure

994
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,703
He's doing

995
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
Propaganda on

996
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:32,479
Get through the rest of this clip about Alex's

997
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
The reason I raised that is

998
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
What you got

999
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,999
Fog

1000
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,071
And a house I'm like wanting to downsize

1001
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,863
From my four bedroom

1002
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,679
But I've got a bunch of children

1003
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
My fortune

1004
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,263
Are boosters for now

1005
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
Cuz there's some interesting us old sweethearts

1006
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,039
The same room together cuz

1007
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
I don't like living in rich people neighborhood

1008
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
It's just us feel good

1009
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
I'm trying to find something compound something

1010
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
Blue collar

1011
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
And says that I'm

1012
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
Stretch

1013
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,919
I want you to be well be dependent but it's not my God

1014
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,527
Sell my car just because

1015
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
About 22 years

1016
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,391
I don't need some really fast I'm driving fast I just need to be

1017
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
I just go back to my

1018
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
Ford F-150

1019
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,999
Shmoney

1020
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,559
Need money otherwise this on air

1021
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,727
Kid reason ice cream

1022
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,775
Because he was getting that

1023
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Said that on air

1024
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
He's had another kid

1025
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,991
He's had another kid I don't know when Eid but like recently

1026
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,551
As recently as a few months ago he said

1027
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,831
3

1028
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,391
Pretty recently

1029
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Alright

1030
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
Positive

1031
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Right

1032
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
I don't know if that's true

1033
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:35,103
I don't know

1034
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:40,735
No I want to occasionally

1035
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,135
Off-limit is 26

1036
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:53,535
I think it's whatever neutral pronoun

1037
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Them

1038
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
But

1039
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,191
The idea that he doesn't talk about his kids on the air because

1040
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
There's so many threats against the little sweetheart

1041
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
That's weird

1042
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:09,663
Paranoia

1043
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,967
That's a gentle soul

1044
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
Broken

1045
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,319
Is not the word I would use

1046
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Drunk

1047
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951

Threat

1060
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,543

01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,135
Awesome

1140
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:12,255
Unfortunately I realized I realized

1141
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,863
As conservative as crazy conservative as a lot of people

1142
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
Like the Michael Savage

1143
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
With alien talk

1144
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
How do you combined with aliens

1145
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,127
How is it that you feel that way

1146
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Look I believe in

1147
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
Christian

1148
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
I really believe

1149
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,367
Also aliens

1150
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Goats

1151
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,535
Interesting interview with Duncan Trussell talks about some of that stuff

1152
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,607
Interview

1153
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,935
Interesting

1154
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
A little frustrating

1155
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,871
If you want his position

1156
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,503
They have 2.75

1157
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Million

1158
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,671
Top 20 listen to radio shows in the country

1159
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
Not at all

1160
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,583
The last 15 million

1161
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
But give you some

1162
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,167
Contact whoever heard of Kim Komando Show

1163
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,519
Conceivably what this means because these numbers are based on Nielsen

1164
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Professional aggregate

1165
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Alex is on terrestrial radio

1166
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
He would be covered by

1167
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
Yeah statistic

1168
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,343
Glenn Beck program

1169
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,647
Include Sean Hannity Rush Limbaugh

1170
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
Michael Savage

1171
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:48,511
Coast Coast AM radio station

1172
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Have to

1173
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
However

1174
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
We dunno

1175
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
You do not have to

1176
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:07,199
Very public contract making is the you have NPR on the same list at Michaels

1177
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
There's clearly no bias

1178
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
List

1179
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
I am

1180
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
The fact that Alex Jones

1181
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,695
Is not on there means that his actual radio audience

1182
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
Does less than 2.5 million

1183
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
People wait

1184
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
It does have

1185
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,607
A number of people who watches videos on

1186
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
Directly through the website

1187
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,055
I can't possibly end up being

1188
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
Question

1189
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:39,199
Do you think he's gained listeners since he's become

1190
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
What like what would you call him now like a boogeyman like somebody that

1191
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,391
Is much more in the spotlight

1192
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
Just as just

1193
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,047
The old people like watching

1194
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,887
Cinememes

1195
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,447
Do you think that any

1196
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,519
As a as a

1197
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Because at now with

1198
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:11,199
The world works like that f****** guy who murdered Trayvon

1199
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
Will not say his name

1200
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
I hope

1201
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,575
He's I hope it gets there by 2

1202
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
Whenever that happened

1203
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,951
He got millions for his defense fund

1204
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Because

1205
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,047
Conservators are like

1206
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:31,679
I think as a backlash to this making fun of him

1207
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:36,287
People who have rallied around a little bit

1208
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
But

1209
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,151
Statistically speaking based on these numbers that we have from the Nielsen rating

1210
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
It can't possibly be

1211
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
I'll be honest with you we know we reach

1212
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,087
45 million people a week

1213
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,463
The fact that we bring the amount of money we bring in

1214
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,815
It's nothing

1215
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,655
How the Super Bowl has 80 million viewers and brings in

1216
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
$5000000 whatever

1217
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:10,079
We have that amount of yours a week

1218
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Money but it shows how

1219
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,455
Where is ninjas AR bigger

1220
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
When you don't have it

1221
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,319
We don't have the big corporations on the elite

1222
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,623
Who know their advertising in a failure

1223
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,463
Another putting money into doesn't bring back 10% what the effect

1224
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
But their tithing

1225
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,791
Got prop up there a lot

1226
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Nope

1227
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,839
Nope

1228
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,911
45 million people are watching a week is

1229
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,983
45 million people

1230
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:43,871
406

1231
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,455
Absolutely ludicrous that number is unbelievable

1232
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Like the Super Bowl is

1233
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
Getting down closed

1234
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
245 million.

1235
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,111
The numbers are down

1236
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
So that sir

1237
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,975
Note 45 million people do not agree on anything

1238
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,583
Rush Limbaugh's audience time

1239
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,423
That's impossible it's just impossible

1240
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,215
It's there's no way

1241
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,007
There's no what

01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,311
Baby world

1243
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,383
Nope that's not possible either

I want to apologize because

1266
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:42,399
But whatever the operating system that I'm in Gmail that plays audio attachments

1267
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
Has changed

1268
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
Overnight apparel and I can no longer load up clips and have them at the ready to press play

1269

So sorry I am still getting used to not being able to give the setup

1270
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943

01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:09,215
You too drunk to focus when he looks in the mirror also

1377
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
This is my dream

1378
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,176
So but you also

You picked up on

1381
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,344
That little parable

1384
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
He seems to think it was a lottery

1385
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,520
Instantly know that

1386
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,056

1388
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,248
No

1389
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
She had nothing

1390
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
To give

1391
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,112
But that's a high priority of the church

1392
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,648
And the good works

1393
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,720
Is more valuable than your thousand

1394
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,280
And it's because of what it means

1395
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
Alex seems to think

1396
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,192
The point of it is

1397
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
Cuz I ain't

1398
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800

1399
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
She'll be there soon

1400
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
Look

1401
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152

Not afford Healthcare

1403
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
So when she died

1404
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
Oh man

1405
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,232
Good stuff

1406
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:41,632
Even if it's not good

1407
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
What's the exchange rate

1408
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:51,360

Churches

You buy water filters you're not dragging websites and all the other chemicals hundreds of

1412
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,416
Apps to change my wife

1413
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:09,280
You buy bio selenium

1414
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:12,352
They're non-GMO

1415
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,680
Forest Alabama

But you haven't

1418
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,128
And the regenerative

1419
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,688
Process of creativity

1420
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
Realized

1421
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,088

Pastor benefit me and everybody involved

1423
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
Process of

01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
Creative

1425
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:46,400
You mispronounced

1426
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
Is saic

1427
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,432
I like it

1428
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200
Cotija

1429
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
More drunk

1430
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,136
Watching

1431
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,160
Because he has a cup

1432
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,232
Okay I will say this at the end of it

1433
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
You look

1434
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Deflated

1435
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,216
Like it's kind of a conversation he's having with Rob do

1436
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
At the end of that

1437
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:28,128
Coming up I don't want to spoil anything

1438
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
Year

1439
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,016
Off-base

1440
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,720
I was talking to a New York art dealer New York

1441
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
Strangely.

1442
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,816
Trump Tower in penthouse

1443
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
When one of The Heirs of a major

1444
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Restaurants

1445
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,264
New York

1446
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
After 9/11

1447
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
Immoral

1448
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,688
There's this place where

1449
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,736
People would pay $59

1450
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,576
Truskulls with Swisher rhinestones on it

1451
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,392
Did somebody with Leprosy jacked off on

1452
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,232
And I was like why would you spend

1453
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
50 million dollars

1454
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,328
But something so ugly and pathetic

1455
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,168
You don't get it Alex to

1456
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,008
Sacrilegious

1457
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
The fact

1458
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,336
$15 15

1459
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,432
Hundreds of thousands of African Starving Children

1460
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,784
And the fact that they gave it to some weird degenerate artist

1461
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,344
Put a skull with rhinestones

1462
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:45,184
A skull may be worth $500

1463
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
And then they metaphorically

1464
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:56,192
Gave their seed to death not to a woman to create life it was worshipping death

1465
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,776
It was a death offering a death called offering

1466
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,848
50 of 54 million dollars to newspaper

1467
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,664
Semen covered skull

1468
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,712
And then you understand everything

1469
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,272
Oh my God

1470
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,296
Oh yeah

1471
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:15,392
Go and they pay millions a week

1472
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,952
They go back to their pen houses

1473
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,744
And they

1474
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:25,888
That's why they burning I know because that was money for poor people exactly

1475
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,424
It's it's

1476
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,728
It's as good as killing a kid

1477
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:35,360
She ripped off from stockholders

1478
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,200
Can buy a skull covered in disease

1479
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,016
Worship

1480
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,320
Association

1481
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,376
Spreading our link spreading our articles

1482
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,728
Can Google wall Street's addiction to

1483
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:06,592
Journal article

1484
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,896
Was it a New Yorker Max

1485
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,248
So that is so awesome

1486
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:17,344
That story is so awesome

1487
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,648
Would you like to know what you're talkin about

1488
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,232
I just want to live in a world where

1489
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:30,912
Kids golf

1490
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
So

1491
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:39,104
I can find no evidence of semen plays into this at all

1492
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,152
Especially

1493
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,200
I couldn't even find that on

1494
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
Crazy blog

1495
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,552

01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,088
Daily Caller

1497
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,136

Talkin talkin talkin about the sculpture called for the love of God

1499
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,584
It was created by artist named Damien Hirst

1500
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,864
7

1501
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,936
Took a skull

1502
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,312
And then made a platinum

1503
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
Cast of the skull

1504
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,664
And covered it with 8601

1505
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
Actual flawless diamond

1506
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,272
Not Alex Jones is fake.

Well

1512
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
They were

1513
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,656
Different type of

1514
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
The name of the work

1515
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:40,032
In case you were thinking it is some sort of religious thing for the love of God

1516
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,592
It's based on his mom

1517
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
Damien Hirst

1518
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,408
Mom

1519
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,712
And she would say for the love of God what are you going to do

1520
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,600
Right to his mom's quote necessarily

1521
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,952
On it that you bought

1522
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
Legally

1523
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,584
And then in the middle

1524
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:09,216
I don't know and then he also has a

1525
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,848
Giant pink diamond on the forehead

1526
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,664
That sort of the centerpiece of it if you want

1527
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,480
That's the that's the furlough

1528
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,272
God peace

1529
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,552
Such a bummer

1530
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,344
Kind of

1531
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,928
It's a little bit of a bummer because it is expensive

1532
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,232
Is it cost 14 million lb for him to make

1533
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
Because of all the time and platinum

1534
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:39,424
And and the because of a labor of Alex's like

1535
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,496
They paid 54 million dollars for semen covered skull

1536
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
Sell it

1537
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
Why

1538
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:50,944
Yeah she ended up having to buy it along with a Consortium

1539
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,016
We put together a collection of people who bought it

1540
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
Damien Hirst ended up

1541
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,208
Essentially breaking even for this piece of art

1542
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,560
There's two things that I think are really into

1543
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,400
So I don't know a whole lot but when I was looking into it

1544
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,984
What things was the commentary that people had like critics have

1545
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,264
What is the modern

1546
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Art

1547
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,592
Genre really is publicity

1548
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,432
Right marketing is really one of the most modern art form

1549
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,784
Able to use

1550
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,136
Is more impressive

1551
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,696
Don't know

1552
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,488
If you sold it

1553
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:40,864
Who bought it

1554
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
The second thing

1555
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Is that

1556
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,312
Consider the genre of a Memento Mori

1557
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,408
Design to remind you of your mortality

1558
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Observe

1559
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,880
The skull is out of this world Celestial almost

1560
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,928
It proclaimed victory over death

1561
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,280
Infinitely more

1562
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,096
Sadness

1563
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,680
Ventus theme the diamond skull is Glory itself

1564
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,240
I know but that's all

1565
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
We'll talk man

1566
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:26,176
He's kind of interesting in that you have a skull which is kind of

1567
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
The symbol of death

1568
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
I meant you have

1569
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,272
Attached to it

1570
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
Platinum

1571
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
I'm

1572
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,696
Thousands of Realtors the piss out of

1573
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,720
Materialism

1574
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
And money in some way

1575
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
It is supposed to have some common

1576
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:48,704
Know whether it's some stupid piece

1577
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,752
It is

1578
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:54,848
Any of the legitimate

1579
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,944
Might my first reaction to that

1580
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,832
Sure

1581
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
No it's

1582
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,816
Also I do

1583
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,400
It's possible

1584
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,312
Give me my commercial for the socket

1585
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,872
I got this

1586
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
Deep Earth crystals

1587
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:34,272
Universal

1588
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:42,208
54 million dollars for this

1589
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:47,840
Nope but then the idea that they're doing it to deprive kids could be saving or whatever is stupid

1590
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:53,984
Absolutely if possible he was on a yacht with someone they lied to him

1591
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,896
It's even more possible he has never been married

1592
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:07,296
I don't understand

1593
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,648
Little yachty and that is

1594
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,952
Turn up

1595
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
I know nothing about the money

1596
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,096
People go and get art and then burn it

1597
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
That is

1598
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
Whole thing that

1599
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,776
Higher two-minute clip is just Alex

1600
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,848
Drunkenly talkingshit there's

1601
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,640
Nothing there there

1602
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,176
He's pausing

1603
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,088
Really what he's doing is just

1604
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:44,160
Trying to find a way to get into their killing

1605
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:49,792
That's his main goal there is to find any way to make rich people

1606
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,680
You need to do no further work

1607
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
Then just saying

1608
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
The art world is decadent

1609
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,032
Excessive

1610
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,080
We all agree with

1611
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,872
Most people agree

1612
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:07,456
Even if you

1613
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,296
We're open-minded

1614
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
We would agree with that statement

1615
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,928
Yeah for the most I mean like even your your important artists

1616
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,024
Probably like

1617
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584
Chinese artist who is

1618
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,144
Openly

1619
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,496
See you making the jerk-off symbol

1620
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,544
The Chinese artist and activist

1621
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,848
He's basically fighting

1622
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,128
Chinese

1623
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
Horribly repressive

1624
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,736
Chinese government

1625
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
Trying to censor every

1626
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
Did he make

1627
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,672
Stuff one of the big things that happened though is

1628
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,208
He was part of the

1629
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,232
Chinese Olympics

1630
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,280
He was part of the design committee for

1631
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,328
And he was the first person

1632
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,120
As part of that too

1633
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Come out and say

1634
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
This is just b*******

1635
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,704
Propaganda

1636
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,008
What I thought it was going to be is very

1637
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,592
From what it wound up being okay

1638
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
Imprisoned has jailed

1639
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,920
Speaking out against

1640
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,248
Blackshear

1641
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,784
More

1642
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:19,904
AR

1643
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,376
At the end of the day the bottom line is Alex Jones

1644
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
But

1645
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,936
We can't take away from

1646
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
Studied

1647
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,008
Alex Jones

1648
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,288
Has researched

1649
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
I didn't f****** know what

1650
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,664
Do you want to know what he study

1651
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,880
Public exhibition of what you're doing gives it

1652
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,416
More power when you do it

1653
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,488
So you say oh we have photos of naked

1654
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,024
Inflight showing our walls

1655
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,096
And where the Washington Post promoting are deviantART

1656
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,568
I said that I said the pizza place to Media focused on

1657
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,104
I don't have it so bad

1658
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,176
Alpana Singh all that they should be left alone because the media focused on them

1659
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:19,040
I never brought up but I said to expose the real stuff

1660
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
PowerBack

1661
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,816
Realized

1662
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
Travis Scott

1663
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
These people want to be Machiavelli

1664
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,008
They don't even know why they're

1665
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,288
Worshipping

1666
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
A skull

1667
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,384
Somebody with diseases

1668
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
Masturbated on

1669
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,736
54 million dollars to

1670
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,296
Virginia an idiot

1671
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,136
Want to know more about him

1672
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,512
I just saw him

1673
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,936
Lima Library

1674
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,520
Let's just jump

1675
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,544
Destitute

1676
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,664
This is more talk about

1677
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,784
Further discussion on episode

1678
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,856
No

1679
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,648
Brain would allow that apology

1680
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,672
Exist

1681
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:32,000
And then just move on it had to come back to

1682
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,984
Just working too

1683
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,288
The James Oliphant has threatened

1684
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,568
Confirmed he has said that

1685
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,688
Filled

1686
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:54,784
Retract that stuff on the air about it

1687
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,344
I'm trying to transition it into I'm a defender of the

1688
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
The children

1689
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
And

1690
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:04,000
Barbies for me I would never say that abusive children isn't the real issue

1691
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
Is it absolutely a real issue

1692
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,608
And I support

1693
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
I don't

1694
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,168
Support what he's doing

1695
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,192
Anyway

1696
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,984
We'll get to that in another time

1697
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
This is

1698
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,336
Adjust a straight-up lie about the situation with

1699
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:26,016

1700
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,744
Retraction

Tickets at. Wheels

1713
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,512
What's on the news

1714
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:11,328
I don't care what's on seeing this b*******

1715
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,728

She's got new that it was for a shed

1717
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:28,992

Elaborately running around of the government what have you

1721
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:41,024
Of course

1722
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,304
Everybody by

1723
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
Thinking

1724
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,120
The fact that it's happening

1725
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
At what place

1726
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
That discredits

1727
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:52,288
Tylenol over the place

1728
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:57,408
I want to be clear I was watching pizzagate happen from day one

1729
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Cruising

1730
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,968
Conspiracy blogs

1731
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
On the forums

But I when were Cruisin together

1736
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,744
Watched it develop

1737
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
From

1738
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,304

1740
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,912
4 months ago or so

1741
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,264
And the whole time

1742
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,800
It was all about the

1743
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,592
Everything was about

1744
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:30,944
I watched videos

1745
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:34,784
He's presenting his position on it is it

1746
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,600
Completely

1747
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:44,256
To one of our friends on Twitter

1748
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,048
Oh yeah

1749
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:53,984
Have a copy of one of the videos that Alex Jones deleted about Marrakesh

1750
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,288
Thank You album

McCain

1753
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Corrupt

1754
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,328
Set up a priesthood to sacrifice children

1755
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
Too dark.

1756
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,912
And that is still going on today

1757
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:38,016
Before before he even gets into it I just want to say I've read all the way

1758
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
The emails

1759
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,232
Is not in

1760
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,304
He hasn't read them

1761
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:54,656
Pedal WikiLeaks

1762
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,728
Basically gone from hero to villain

1763
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,776
On all sides of the spectrum

1764
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:05,408
Every single time somebody mentions WikiLeaks

1765
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,456
You can almost guarantee 6 from

1766
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,736
6 months from now

1767
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,784
They will mention Wikileaks in the exact

1768
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,552
Opposite

1769
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,392
About the same time almost everybody will

1770
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,696
If you might come out

1771
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,328
I don't want to deal with you

1772
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,120
A couple of these emails in the

1773
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,448
He characterizes them makes it clear that he hasn't read them

1774
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
Someone is just

1775
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,776
And he has

1776
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
Embellished

1777
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Can imagine our Alex

1778
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,664
Not at all

1779
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,968
Are you

1780
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
Pizzagate is it called

1781
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,208
Is a rabbit hole

1782
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,376
The pizzagates existence

1783
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:00,960
100% of it

1784
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,264
100% of it was

1785
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,592
About Clinton podesta the basement

1786
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,688
Comet Ping Pong what the entire investigation

1787
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,736
It was about

1788
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
Instagram page

1789
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
Weird things

1790
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,856
S*** like that it was

1791
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,160
Dumbest speculation ever

1792
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,464
Can claim

1793
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,024
We're covering this

1794
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,864
Is Ludacris

1795
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,424

1798
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:43,456
He's talking about joke videos

1799
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,272
Then he got fired

1800
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,368
Infowars.com pizzagate is real

1801
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,160
Only question is

1802
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,696
What exactly is it

1803
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,376
The wrong manual this is this is

1804
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,912
Emmanuel

1805
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,664

In the hot tub for your

1813
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,120
None of that was in the email that he reference

1814
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,448
That podesta email was just someone

1815
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,032
Who said that

1816
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,312

Of this

1820
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784

He's not

1830
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872

2 minutes into this clip he's already

1834
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,184
Venture out to be a liar

1835
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,512
It gets worse

1836
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,792

01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,232
The fake code

1845
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,280
Other fake pedophile code

1846
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,144

If you want to attack an artist

1869
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,568
Trying to pretend that their art

1870
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
Is literal

1871
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:59,712
You're a hundred percent missing the point

1872
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,760
Distinction between the world of

1876
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,328
100% literal

1877
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,424

01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:32,032
He said he's paid for me

1912
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:38,432
Whatever we say I can back up with documentation or Alex Jones own words

1913
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,968

Afraid

2046
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,968
To find something to zero in on it

2047
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:44,576
I recently actually studied the Salem witch trials

Might not be a real person

2060
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,256
This could be an automated voice

2061
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,936
That then Alex could be hiding behind John bound as like

2062
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:38,336

Hoarding Shadows of Washington d.c.

2078
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,032
Is about to be open

2079
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,568
Your front door

2080
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,128

2081
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,920
Which

2082
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:49,760
1

2083
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:57,184
Video

2084
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:02,816
And Facebook is a murdered cut in pieces and

2085
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,584
It's not

2086
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,120
Trump

2087
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:09,728
Also I don't think the size of the genitalia matters in this particular situation

2088
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,776
I don't know anymore

2089
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:22,272
And I can go out to investigate myself

2090
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:26,368
I'm at the Shell controller over-the-top people

2091
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,392
Nope

2092
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:33,280
We have covered we are covering and all I know is God help us were in the hands.

2093
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,656
I mean

2094
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:39,680
Set

2095
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
Absolute

2096
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,984
100% evidence

2097
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,288
That his Narrative of what he covered is Ally

2098
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:48,640
That's not even the worst I can't find still the clip

2099
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:53,248
Directly remember him talking about how someone should go check it out

2100
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,552
Absolutely

2101
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,600
So I can scrub the internet

2102
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,672
Yeah it's probably in the

2103
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,840
I bet Alex going to fall for this

2104
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,680
More Hot Tips

2105
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,728
Pizzagate

2106
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,752
Because I'd like to be able to

2107
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,312
Like I'd like to know

2108
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:23,712
Somebody goes to Alex

2109
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:28,320
Again I want to be totally clear

2110
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:31,648
Abuse of children is very real

2111
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,416
Problem

2112
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:35,232
This is this is b*******

2113
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,768

Legitimate

2116
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:44,704
Matters for political point

2117
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:49,312
It's only to make money and to demonize

2118
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:58,784
Alex is drunk ramblings

2119
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,064
Some good old rock

2120
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,624
Return to the races

2121
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,000
These people that are weasels

2122
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,304
I sit here

2123
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,840
Open myself up to it

2124
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,656
Because I'm

2125
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,424

2126
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:19,008
It's because I'm real

2127
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:22,592
I want the return of real

Also you want

2130
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,320
Or reopen maybe because it's WrestleMania weekend

2131
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:36,672
I'm getting into shoot promo mode

2132
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:43,072
We are not funded by anybody

2133
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,400
We are creative types

2134
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:53,312
Neither of us are beholden to the Democratic party

2135
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:57,152
Regenerative power of creativity

2136
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,016

I am 100% confident

2150
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,144
Get into a conversation with Alex

2151
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,960
I mean I couldn't handle his yelling

2152
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:53,728
And all that stuff

2153
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,032
Cupcake

2154
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,568
I couldn't have a cupcake

2155
02:03:57,824 --> 02:04:03,968

2162
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,104
Even better

2163
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,200
I'd like to see from the love of God

2164
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,016
Is work at the race

2165
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,344
Family in this is Chris got to go with your family

Appreciate Marcos Morales and Rob doing the rest of her being here

2167
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,464
Is this where Rob DeRozan

2168
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,608
The left tells you all day how much they care about you

2169
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,680
One of the ones that want Eugenics and does humility

2170
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,472
I don't care what color

2171
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,800
Your skin is

2172
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,920
This is fundamental to everybody

2173
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:10,272
If you got good music I'm going to listen to your music whether you're white

2174
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,416
Weather in South Africa

2175
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
Really

2176
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,280
That's how we see the world right

2177
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,072
If you got good food

2178
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,912
I've gone in restaurants owned by

2179
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:30,496
Clearly are racist against white people

2180
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,056
Doctor

2181
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,528
I don't need it

2182
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,808
I think at this point he's hung

2183
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:50,464
I think I think I think he's at the point of drunk or his

2184
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,256
Restaurants

2185
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
I need

2186
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:07,104
Improve It On The Rain

2187
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,664
I want I want

2188
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,968
Hooray lashes out of

2189
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:13,248
A little bit

2190
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,296
Sit here

2191
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,576
And tell you

2192
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,952
That I'm

2193
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:25,792
Races to prove myself to you

2194
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,840
Everything I do

2195
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,864
It's about two people

2196
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,400
Because

2197
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,264
Sociopath or psychopath I know metaphysical

2198
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,824
That's your privilege mathematics

2199
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:40,384
Everything

2200
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:45,504
Does that mean in Chinese

2201
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,096
I think that you and I might believe that

2202
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:07,008
Generalizing a group of people

2203
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,032
IFixit

2204
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,824
You're going to need a backup

2205
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,360
Text with evidence

2206
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:14,688
I think fundamentally

2207
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,712
Let's look it up right now

2208
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:16,480
Is it

2209
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:18,528
Generalizing a group of people

2210
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,832
I think that's I made Prejudice ascertain

2211
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:23,136
Only wrapped up in that

2212
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,672
Formal definition of rapist

2213
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:29,024
Is it just a picture of Alex Jones

2214
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,560
It's actually a picture of Thomas

2215
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,984
A person who shows discrimination or prejudice against people believe that a particular

2216
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,032
Superior to others

2217
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,920
Discrimination certainly in the sense that he discriminates

2218
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:48,480
Against groups of people and loves them in

2219
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,016
Certainly

2220
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,576
He definitely

2221
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:57,440
Seems to be very concerned with the white White's race

2222
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,232
That was funny

2223
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:05,632
That was funny

2224
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,984
I'm going to back him up on this one

2225
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,032

Intuit prejudiced hole

2233
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:33,280
I don't just like Muslims because they've got brown-skinned a lot of them

2234
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,840
I just like them cuz they're always killing each other

2235
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:39,168
We're selling them to the bomb makers want bomb somebody

2236
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,776
Saudi Arabia is a hell

2237
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,056
It's like the worst

2238
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:51,712
No rock and roll radio.

In the 50s

2246

Chris Hemsworth

2247
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,336
You know what

2248
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,360
Saudi Arabia

2249
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,152
Just a whole country of John Lithgow

2250
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,784
I will we go back to this present from the Sun

2251
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:36,512
Dislike

Black people

2253
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,448
Listen

2254
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,472
I'm not racist

2255
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:46,496
But

2256
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:50,336
If every single f****** that you know

2257
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,808
World

2258
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,088
The facts

2259
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:08,000
Keep on killing each other

2260
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:16,192
I know we are killing them

2261
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:19,008
And the bomb makers that I love and support so much

2262
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:22,336
They got a

2263
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,896
And maybe I'm the one who provides

2264
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:33,856
That's him being drunk and not being able to figure out exactly like where is the line that I drop

2265
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:37,184
Muslims keep killing each other

2266
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,976
In the morning when I wake up

2267
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:41,024
Am I going to have to

2268
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,608
You know what everyone knows that I know more about

2269
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,632
Then I was letting on

2270
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,960
That's what I think is going on

2271
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:55,360
That's why I think he brings that clarification

2272
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:59,200
Much of the case whenever you're really drunk at you over explain yourself

2273
02:10:59,456 --> 02:10:59,968
The only

2274
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:05,088
Supervisor

2275
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:15,328
I don't care if you're some guy but you're a woman

2276
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,168
What the hell I don't I don't have to get you

2277
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,824
Five-year-old alone

2278
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,896
Call my girl

2279
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:30,432
Don't teach them about sex

2280
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,760
I'm not here

2281
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:40,416
Broadcast

2282
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,840
Supposed parting shot

2283
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:54,240
Melissa train

2284
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
Clear that

2285
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:01,152
Staff wants to leave

2286
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:04,736
But they thought it was going to end when Rodger Stone

2287
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,784
Oh did I do

2288
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,808
Sitting there like

2289
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:14,464
What is everybody

2290
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,744
This isn't over

2291
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:17,280
It's not no

2292
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:25,984
Camellias Grill

2293
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:34,944
I want to talk to Bart

2294
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:42,112
We are not strangers broadcasting 2 million mg

2295
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:42,880
I apologize

2296
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:43,904
Let me back off

2297
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,208
At least hundreds of people

2298
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,768
Yeah I want to say this

2299
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:52,608
Idiots have no understanding

2300
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,632
The trans community

2301
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:57,984
And for that matter

2302
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,032
I don't understand

2303
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:05,664
Degrading the way you seek by people

2304
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,456
And you should be ashamed of yourself

2305
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:09,760
Especially considering that you're doing the drunk

2306
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:10,784
On the air

2307
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,064
Your f****** monster

2308
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,600
And

2309
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:20,256
Justin balls we just understand

2310
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,048
A little bit

2311
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,400
We're going to get to this next

2312
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,472
We're coming we're coming towards

2313
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,776
I'm going to be perfectly honest with you

2314
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:33,056
We're not coming towards

2315
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:33,824
End

2316
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:40,224
A half hour left of his show

2317
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:47,392
I got to be honest I wanted to play you the entire thing actor Rodger Stone leave

2318
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:49,952
It's just such scatterbrain on cell

2319
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,488
Pizzagate

2320
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:53,280
It's a skull covered in tattoos

2321
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:55,072
Misunderstanding

2322
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,096
Scripture

2323
02:13:56,352 --> 02:14:02,496
Racism racism is my friend we are going to get into a

2324
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,264
Anti-semite

2325
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,032
AutoZone

2326
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:10,432
This morning

2327
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:14,016
Alex Jones has the Jewish Mafia Run the World

2328
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:15,296
And I went no I said

2329
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:17,600
There's an Italian mafia Mexican Mafia

2330
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:21,184
Dixie Mafia is horrible

2331
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:24,000
Miami Southridge

2332
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:26,816
A white moth

2333
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:32,448
I go yeah there's a Jewish Mafia George Soros was part of it then they work for the Nazis

2334
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,496
They said I said choose your evil

2335
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
What the hell

2336
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
It's just

2337
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:45,760
It's crazy

2338
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:08,544
I don't I don't

2339
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,592
Does fall into a lot of

2340
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,616
Antiques

2341
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:18,272
He falls into a lot of anti-Semitic Canard

2342
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:22,112
In one of the big ones is this idea that there was

2343
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,136
Crypto-jews

2344
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:26,208
Behind the scenes and helping with the Holocaust

2345
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,232
And

2346
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:28,512
Kids

2347
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:32,608
You can go to our website I wrote an article about this

2348
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:37,472
About the idea that he was working with Nazis

2349
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:40,032
It's absurd

2350
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,056
18 years old at the time

2351
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,592
And wasn't doing anything

2352
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:43,872
He was

2353
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:45,408
Scared for his

2354
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,176
Wife

2355
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,832
These are killing me

2356
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:58,976
It's also races

2357
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,048
I might as well be Mexican

2358
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,840
Cuz I love tacos

2359
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,656
Hello tacos and their women are beautiful

2360
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,192
That's horribly about this

2361
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,216
Batavia races

2362
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:10,496
Stats elephant

2363
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:16,896
Nope can't be racist if you eat all their food and like their women but the fact is I eat a lot

2364
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,920
Sushi

2365
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:28,672
The idea that use of the tacos and mix

2366
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,952
Can women as evidence

2367
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:30,976
He's not racist

2368
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:34,048
To support his idea

2369
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:36,096
I didn't say

2370
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:36,864
Meme

2371
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,728
TripAdvisor play speaking

2372
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,032
If that is your analog

2373
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,568
You're f*****

2374
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:48,640
So you gets worse you talked a little bit more about the

2375
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,480
They know they're fake know so they cost

2376
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,272
And they fully committed

2377
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:58,368
I'll show you this tree robbed I don't think so

2378
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,928
I know what they're going to do after this

2379
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:06,560
I'm just because I thought I'd seen it all

2380
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,728
I didn't say that

2381
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:21,920
Are we even on the show

2382
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,248
That's ridiculous

2383
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:26,784
It's not

2384
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,624
Like I said we will eventually

2385
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:37,024
Montgomery we will do an episode about the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2386
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,096
Exactly how

2387
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:42,912
False narrative

2388
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,496
Admire you

2389
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,336
You're here for a reason

2390
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,272
All of his

2391
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:03,392
Cabal all of that is built

2392
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:05,440
From the foundation of anti-semitism

2393
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:08,256
He pretends he doesn't understand that is Ludacris

2394
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:16,192
And then on top of that

2395
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:18,496
And they were really responsible for the Holocaust

2396
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:21,312
And as you've gotten into in the last

2397
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,848
Week or so

2398
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,408
Episode

2399
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,688
Eventually

2400
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:29,248
He's been starting to spout some

2401
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,296
Revisionist history about the Holocaust

2402
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:35,392
Super uncomfortable

2403
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:36,416
Set up Hitler

2404
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,696
What kind of things

2405
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:42,816
There is nothing

2406
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:44,864
Quite so Americana

2407
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:53,312
Real American

2408
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:57,920
From Germans

2409
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,200
In America

2410
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,624
Prescott Bush

2411
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:07,392
History

2412
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:08,928
Beyond

2413
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:10,976
High school for headline

2414
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:12,512
Where were the heroes

2415
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:15,840
Hitler

2416
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:16,864
Jo-Ann's

2417
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,656
Understandably

2418
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:20,704
Yeah

2419
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,520
Really good formula

2420
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,896
My bad.

2421
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:32,736
Starts rambling about it

2422
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,296
Oil stuff

2423
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,088
I want to play

2424
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Because

2425
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,184
Credibly not true

2426
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:43,488
I'm at the same time

2427
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,512
Isabella 10

2428
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:45,536
So here we go

2429
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:49,376
Family making $100,000 a month

2430
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:51,936
All my cousins

2431
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:55,776
Oil

2432
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:58,080
15 years ago 10 years ago

2433
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:01,664
And then now because of a cold

2434
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:04,736
Bryant family gets like $3,000 a month

2435
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,784
Heather's property taxes on

2436
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:19,584
And then personally if I was one of these self-fulfilling assholes

2437
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,936
About how do I make money

2438
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,616
I cheered

2439
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:32,384
Coming back

2440
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:34,688
The paychecks going from $100,000

2441
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,224
Thousand dollars

2442
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,504
Thousand dollars

2443
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,064
The $3,000

2444
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,624
$0

2445
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:44,416
10 -

2446
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:46,720
So every expert

2447
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:49,280
Looked into it

2448
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:52,352
I mean you can just do some research on your own and find this out

2449
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,120
Want to

2450
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:56,192
Citations in front of me but

2451
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:58,240
Cleancult

2452
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,520
Is complete nonsense

2453
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:03,872
Nope jobs are going to come back

2454
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:07,200
Absurd for the reason

2455
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:10,528
Economically viable it doesn't matter

2456
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,856
The cost of coal is higher than

2457
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,880
The cost of

2458
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:17,184
Father not as polluting

2459
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:22,560
Biggest problem

2460
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:25,376
Automation

2461
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:26,144
Is that

2462
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,472
It is inevitable that clean energy is going

2463
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:32,800
And it is going to be

2464
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,592
More cost-effective than trying to

2465
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,616
To prop up.

2466
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:40,736
Call or we will die

2467
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:47,136
People are trying to keep those old Industries going to ensure that we all

2468
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
Glycate

2469
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:52,256
It's like they're grasping for

2470
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,792
10 more years of

2471
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,584
A little bit more so that

2472
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,632
We lose 100 Years of

2473
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:59,680
Has metaphors but made

2474
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:07,360
The metaphor I think it's probably been made before but it's like

2475
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:11,200
Tomorrow

2476
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:13,760
That sort of thing

2477
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:17,344
Like

2478
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:19,136
As much as I

2479
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:19,904
I hate

2480
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,184
The GOP

2481
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:22,464
Trumpet

2482
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,560
Sure

2483
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
Like it's not there

2484
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:34,496
Useful idiots

2485
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:35,520
It's like Ryan

2486
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,128
It's obvious

2487
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:44,224
Breakthrough

2488
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,992
Idiot

2489
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,528
But

2490
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,064
Pay for

2491
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:52,672
Show

2492
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,440
Like

2493
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:55,232
Like I would rather people go to

2494
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,256
Do billionaires homes

2495
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,328
They're call your representative

2496
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,472
Months

2497
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,752
Maybe a year

2498
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,592
Come back because this is

2499
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:12,896
Control

2500
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:15,712
This is exactly like the French Revolution

2501
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:18,272
Exactly like the French Revolution

2502
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:21,088
Scooter later

2503
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:26,720
Slightly on the wrong side

2504
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,256
Probably

2505
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:30,560
Super Bowl

2506
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,608
Compared to

2507
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:33,632
A lot of people

2508
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:37,472
Portage

2509
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,496
Do we might

2510
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:39,520
Get our heads

2511
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
I'm willing to make that sack

2512
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:43,872
11:30 today

2513
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,664
But

2514
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:50,272
Included

2515
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:53,856
The reason I wanted to pause this clip here and then beyond

2516
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:55,136
And talk about how like

2517
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,440
Are my family

2518
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,976
Cole

2519
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,608
The idea that they were making

2520
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,632
Hundreds of thousands

2521
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:06,656
The dollars a month

2522
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:09,216
And then check is down to like 3,000

2523
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:12,032
Trump has been in office for

2524
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:16,384
Do you have it there

2525
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:19,968
Money has gone down that he hasn't even brought back

2526
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:26,368
It could possibly have that big dent in there

2527
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:28,160
Economic viability

2528
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:29,184
Is b*******

2529
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:32,512
If it's true the reason is because their Wells are gone through

2530
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:36,352
Like if they don't have the product

2531
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,680
I am going again

2532
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:42,496
My own self-interest in my family self-interest

2533
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:44,288
You just literally can't be true

2534
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:49,152
This reworking its reworking the reality

2535
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:53,504
We're losing jobs or we're losing money or so on and so forth

2536
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,576
Say it like that

2537
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:02,976
I one more and then we're going to get really weird

2538
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:04,000
Okay

2539
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:07,072
Here's the here's the last

2540
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
Does weave into demon

2541
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:15,008
Climatologists astrophysicists say the Earth's dying

2542
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:18,848
Yeah

2543
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,896
To survive energy

2544
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,176
We terraform

2545
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:23,968
Cliches the planet

2546
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:27,552
I never seen aliens real

2547
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,952
You got the brown.

2548
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:35,232
Carbon dioxide

2549
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:37,536
Hundreds of millions of years

2550
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,304
A lot

2551
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:42,912
When the planet doesn't have that cash

2552
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:45,984
We have an energy source to put it back

2553
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,264
Why would we do that

2554
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:52,384
Hookah Hookah come up with that robbed

2555
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,944
People that hate

2556
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:57,248
So I can only assume that they're not

2557
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,784
If they don't like humans

2558
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:02,368
Daddy made a great point there do

2559
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,392
I can only

2560
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:04,928
I can only assume

2561
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:07,744
Perfect

2562
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:08,768
Logical

2563
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,912
You have to agree

2564
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:16,448
That if they hate

2565
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:17,984
They're not human

2566
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,752
That's just

2567
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:19,520
Let's just say

2568
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:21,568
Okay

2569
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:24,384
Used to Cartesian logic

2570
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:27,968
Yes

2571
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:32,576
Therefore the art

2572
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,624
If

2573
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,488
The second premises

2574
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:42,560
Implied in there is all who hate humans are not

2575
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,608
So therefore

2576
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,376
These people are

2577
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,288
Human

2578
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,360
I think humanity is a whole is problematic

2579
02:26:58,176 --> 02:27:00,224
The Matrix agent Smith

2580
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,760
Is like I think humanity is it

2581
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:03,040
The disease I was kind of like

2582
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:04,832
Yeah you're probably right

2583
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:09,184
Hitman video you can find online of Rogan

2584
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,720
People like to take his

2585
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:13,792
And put them over swelling music

2586
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:17,376
But he does have a really interesting observation about the idea

2587
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,424
Flyover cities the kind of look

2588
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:20,960
Organs

2589
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:22,752
Yeah there's like that

2590
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:26,336
Inflow of cars going in and out of the city

2591
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:27,360
I'd like

2592
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:32,224
To work into the suburbs to go home like blood flowing in and out of

2593
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:36,576
And then if you look at big cities like look like

2594
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:38,368
It looks like

2595
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:40,160
Disease on the on the

2596
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:43,232
That's a super interesting thought

2597
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:51,936
Compare it to

2598
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:55,520
Which are if you were an alien

2599
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:57,056
And this point has been made

2600
02:27:57,568 --> 02:27:58,336
By Amelia

2601
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:07,040
Came to Earth

2602
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:10,112
Reality would be you would say that ants are the actual

2603
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:13,184
There

2604
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,560
Out out out number

2605
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,864
There are Continental

2606
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:22,400
Which is

2607
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,680
Like Mike

2608
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,496
They are warfaring

2609
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,288
One thing that

2610
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:31,360
Really

2611
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,384
Efficient

2612
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:33,920
Yo

2613
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:34,944
Like

2614
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,248
We can't really compete with that level of

2615
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:42,624
To work

2616
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,392
Exactly

2617
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:49,792
Moisturizing.

2618
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:58,752
I'm going to say

2619
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:00,800
3 out of the next

2620
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:01,568
Sport Clips

2621
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,872
3

2622
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:07,200
Okay

2623
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:08,224
Different way

2624
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,016
But the other three are like

2625
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:14,880
End of the night

2626
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:17,184
Everyone left the party

2627
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:20,512
What are you talkin about

2628
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,304
Get this drunk ass out of your house

2629
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:26,912
I said earlier in the show is what's going on now

2630
02:29:27,424 --> 02:29:29,216
Rob do is sitting at the desk

2631
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:31,776
And Alex won't look

2632
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:36,896
Looks like he's ready to go

2633
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:39,200
He's got his coat on

2634
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,504
He really has

2635
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,528
Yes

2636
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:46,112
And it's like this

2637
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:47,648
We got to deal with a drunk

2638
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,416
Stepdad again

2639
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:52,768
Probably what it is

2640
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:54,816
I would have to ask

2641
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:58,400
This glimpse into that world

2642
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,728
I don't know

2643
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:03,264
It's so hard to

2644
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,312
Hotel

2645
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,360
I think it's I think it's

2646
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:10,432
I have different feelings different employees

2647
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,480
To at least

2648
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:14,016
One employee of Infowars

2649
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:14,784
It's just the cam

2650
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:16,320
Who just

2651
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,256
Insurance

2652
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,376
It could be independent contractor

2653
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:37,824
We're doing more broadcast and more because we're getting the sensor data

2654
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:38,592
You know what

2655
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:39,872
Just like that

2656
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,176
Provide Lubbock's on the walls and a half

2657
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:44,224
America

2658
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:45,248
And you're up

2659
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:50,624
They didn't do it on a power trip

2660
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,184
To transfer knowledge

2661
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:56,768
Appreciated

2662
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,328
New way other people

2663
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:03,680
The psychopath and sociopath

2664
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:05,216
Because we care about people

2665
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:06,240
That's not why

2666
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:12,640
Environmentalism Augusta guilt

2667
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:15,968
That

2668
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,248
Ludacris

2669
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:25,696
I have no idea

2670
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:36,192
Thousands of years later we figured out they wanted to communicate with each other

2671
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:40,032
Location cuz everything was orally transmitted everything was

2672
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:44,128
Long lineage of cultures before they had writing

2673
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,432
Where everything was just done in like

2674
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:47,712
Panera

2675
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,992
They would tell

2676
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:55,904
Stories around campfires the transmitted information that was important to their culture

2677
02:31:57,184 --> 02:31:59,232
Which is the most rated

2678
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:01,280
Really old religion

2679
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,816
It's from first

2680
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:03,840
Account

2681
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:06,144
People finally written down oral tradition

2682
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:12,288
Every time

2683
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,568
Continue

2684
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,592
Is always wanted

2685
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:19,712
It's one of those things that a lot of people don't understand necessarily is that Homer wasn't a person

2686
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:21,504
Moberly

2687
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:25,600
Homer was the oral tradition that created

2688
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:28,416
Carry down the books

2689
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:31,744
Absolutely

2690
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,632
Ascribed

2691
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:40,704
18

2692
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:44,544
Explain to me the people don't understand that about

2693
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:52,224
Like Socrates

2694
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,528
Describe these words to his

2695
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:58,368
Minnesota

2696
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:02,464
Interesting thoughts you have Alex about to cave drawings and what have you

2697
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:06,816
People don't use environmentalism

2698
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,096
Against you as a weapon

2699
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,960
They're scared about science

2700
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:17,824
Because his premise is that there's not enough carbon dioxide

2701
02:33:21,664 --> 02:33:22,176
The Earth is

2702
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:22,944
Carbondale

2703
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:27,552
So we actually need carbon dioxide

2704
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:30,624
The atmosphere

2705
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:36,512
F*** if you talkin because his belief is that this whole environmentalism is basically just trying

2706
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:38,304
To push carbon taxes

2707
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:39,584
And trying to

2708
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,120
Shackle businesses

2709
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:43,424
Put it under you

2710
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,704
Control put it on

2711
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,264
Falcor

2712
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,104
Troll doll carbon

2713
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:57,504
Weird world

2714
02:33:58,272 --> 02:34:01,856
Hubie to Humboldt even stuff that

2715
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:04,416
So dumb

2716
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:08,000
We don't have time and I'm a little bit buzzed

2717
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:10,560
So I don't want to get into like the ideas of

2718
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:13,632
Exactly why this version of climate denial is

2719
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:14,912
I'm stupid

2720
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:17,728
But maybe we can do that another day

2721
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,776
You know what this particular brand

2722
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:23,104
You don't might be fun

2723
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:23,872
You take this

2724
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:24,896
Idea

2725
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:31,296
Maybe you do a dentist Montgomery style episode about that

2726
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:36,672
Can do that conversation

2727
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:40,000
Alex Jones for no reason

2728
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:49,216
Eog's the way they got Rugrats the government

2729
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:52,032
Leaving Rocky fighting some foreign takeover

2730
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:55,360
Heatherdowns and kill the president major publication

2731
02:34:55,872 --> 02:35:01,248
Hit right in the all the Republicans that don't know how long they're Russians

2732
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,208
Enterprise like

2733
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,024
Whatever

2734
02:35:13,792 --> 02:35:17,120
Did you get that this talk about the Branch Davidians

2735
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:19,168
I want to make sure everyone is listening

2736
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:19,936
Do you talk

2737
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
King about

2738
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,472
Waco

2739
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:28,384
I don't know how to say that the bad corollary but that is an example of

2740
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,152
Some crazy

2741
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:32,736
It's not an example of the public being like hooray

2742
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:35,552
Everyone

2743
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:37,600
Batshit insane even

2744
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,136
Very liberal people

2745
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:41,952
Conservatives also everyone thought

2746
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,512
This is horrifying

2747
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:47,840
What the f*** is going on

2748
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,632
Cheap f*****-up

2749
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:50,656
She don't

2750
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,424
What

2751
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:52,960
I don't know

2752
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:55,008
It's very complicated

2753
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,592
It's very complicated case

2754
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,664
The people there

2755
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:03,712
For mostly victim

2756
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:07,552
A lot of them brainwashed and willing victim

2757
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
Horrible person

2758
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:12,672
Children

2759
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:15,744
Just he was out of line.

2760
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:22,144
Strongest worth

2761
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,192
I think I might

2762
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:24,960
Look

2763
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:26,496
Do you know what he was

2764
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:32,128
Do you know what he really was really really was

2765
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,688
Cool the reality of it is out of stock I don't want it

2766
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:35,968
Dive deep into that

2767
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:36,736
Acquitted

2768
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:41,088
The bigger point is that no one was cool with it

2769
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,880
People alive

2770
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,256
Do you know what that's like

2771
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:51,584
If you put a lot of carbon dioxide

2772
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:54,400
Cabernet

2773
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:55,680
At some point

2774
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,448
Yep

2775
02:36:57,472 --> 02:37:03,104
It gets worse they talk more about this is an interesting thing to come up because Alex Jones

2776
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:06,176
Experiences

2777
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Waco

2778
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:10,272
Who's from Texas

2779
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:13,088
Sure

2780
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:15,648
Because

2781
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Bill Hicks

2782
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:20,256
The guy who everyone says

2783
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:21,536
Was deeply involved

2784
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,584
About

2785
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,656
So it's super interesting is confluent

2786
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,192
The things

2787
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:28,960
Bill Hicks

2788
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:35,104
Everybody everybody

2789
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:44,832
And then it comes out later that they weren't that bad they were

2790
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:00,192
Just because they they

2791
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:01,472
Talked about

2792
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:04,032
They could have arrested koresh at any time

2793
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:05,568
You heavily armed

2794
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:10,176
Heavily-armed

2795
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:14,528
Still a bunch of people

2796
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:15,296
They were gone

2797
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:17,088
The person

2798
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:23,488
As I understand it I don't I don't know all the details

2799
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:27,584
I've been with that guy died

2800
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,352
The Sun

2801
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:30,400
Was supposed to take over the church

2802
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:34,752
To a little bit of a

2803
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:35,776
David koresh

2804
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,056
Who was the

2805
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:39,104
Lover of the prophetess

2806
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:48,064
Then they got into this thing like who should be in charge of the church to do a bunch of like sort of raise the Dead

2807
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:48,832
Kind of s***

2808
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:52,160
It ended up

2809
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:54,208
What was it what was it

2810
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:57,280
Was it Elijah

2811
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:58,816
Like hey

2812
02:38:59,072 --> 02:39:02,912
Bring all of your all of your holy man in like this

2813
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:06,752
Like

2814
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:08,544
I'm having to do all this

2815
02:39:11,104 --> 02:39:11,872
Snakes

2816
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:16,992
Hey snakes

2817
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:21,600
Date

2818
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:23,904
Is

2819
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,928
David koresh

2820
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:25,952
His followers

2821
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:29,024
The other guys

2822
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:33,120
Had a history of armed conflict with people

2823
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,168
Heavily-armed

2824
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:37,216
And was not coming out of the sky

2825
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:41,312
Wasn't coming out

2826
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,592
Uncle

2827
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:43,360
Number two

2828
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:49,248
Yeah

2829
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:56,672
Restaurants

2830
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,464
Portsmouth

2831
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:00,512
Everything

2832
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,656
I'm finding wounded on that Hill

2833
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:14,592
You know Sheriff was going to go public

2834
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:18,176
I talked to Tom Eggers

2835
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:20,992
Got Academy nomination

2836
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:24,576
Awards and then Taylor

2837
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:41,472
Blowing it out of Marina.

2838
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:43,264
What does scapegoating m

2839
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,336
What they did was wrong

2840
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:49,920
How the people involved in that were haunted by what they did

2841
02:40:50,432 --> 02:40:53,504
And that's why I like they've done later by the seniors how to rectify that

2842
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:56,320
But that was all a psyop on the military

2843
02:40:56,576 --> 02:41:02,720
To see if they could get them to turn into American people and also the media.

2844
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:05,024
Turn us against the military

2845
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,584
So then they would hate us and then they would get their fight

2846
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,632
Instead we're going to love the military

2847
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:10,912
He is so drunk

2848
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:11,680
That

2849
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:12,704
Ludacris

2850
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,472
Yeah

2851
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,032
Just

2852
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:17,824
The most St Louis of rap

2853
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:27,040
Christmas recital

2854
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:33,952
For the players play

2855
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:36,000

2857
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,912
What's a great Murphy Lee quote

2858
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,032
Look

2859
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:51,104
Did the Branch Davidian Waco situationism

2860
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:51,872
Credibly cop

2861
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:53,664
Okay.

2862
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:54,432
That

2863
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:59,808
Spell because just that weird reference from robbed

2864
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:01,344
I can take him down

2865
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,624
In the same way

2866
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,184
Does immediate demonize the Branch Davidian

2867
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:06,464
And talked about how

2868
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:07,488
Kiwi

2869
02:42:07,744 --> 02:42:08,256
F****** kids

2870
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:10,304
She was

2871
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,864
Was

2872
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,912
Guilty of sexual assault

2873
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:16,704
Like he is

2874
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:20,544
What's let's be clear

2875
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:23,104
Kale

2876
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:24,640
Occult member

2877
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:28,224
He wasn't as bad as like Jim Jones

2878
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:30,272
Conversation

2879
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:32,576
They're in the same conversation

2880
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:33,600
Full disclosure

2881
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:36,928
The cult leader

2882
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:38,464
He did jail time

2883
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:41,280
He's not in the conversation

2884
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:42,816
That's how bad calls

2885
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:45,888
Just beat me a call later

2886
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:47,424
Probably going to do jail time

2887
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,472
There is some seriously bad cult leader

2888
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:53,312
Almost anytime there's a scism in a church

2889
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:54,592
If someone

2890
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:56,384
People often another directions

2891
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:58,432
Schism

2892
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:00,992
Acura pronunciation

2893
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:05,344
He's like an offshoot of a church

2894
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:07,392
Generally

2895
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,416
Someone's up

2896
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,488
If your dude

2897
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:15,328
What are you doing

2898
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:18,144
Eclipse last

2899
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,192
This next one

2900
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:22,496
If you have any

2901
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:24,544
Doubt in your mind

2902
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:27,360
Ermine

2903
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:29,408
But Alex has been drunk

2904
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:34,528
Parricide

2905
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:35,808
Please do not interrupt this

2906
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:42,208
You can learn to experience

2907
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:44,256
Didn't learn through

2908
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:46,560
Education

2909
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:50,656
Or you can learn through

2910
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:53,472
Revelation

2911
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,616
Erase memory

2912
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:01,408
So there is always more exactly

2913
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,944
And thanks, Spence

2914
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:04,992
Salvage common sense

2915
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:09,600
Learning

2916
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,160
Elearn

2917
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:13,952
Well

2918
02:44:14,208 --> 02:44:16,256
Education like you said

2919
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:23,424
Experience experience Revelation which probably is the DNA

2920
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:28,288
Well it's spiritual

2921
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
Yeah

2922
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,992
And you really screwing up

2923
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:41,600
That's how you learn that's the one of the biggest way the best way is to learn

2924
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:44,160
Let me ask you this question

2925
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:46,208
Spoiler alert

2926
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:53,376
For the last 2 minutes

2927
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:55,424
He was talking about the different ways to learn

2928
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,704
Estimation of it is

2929
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:00,800
If you want to learn

2930
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:02,592
Let me tell you about the best way to do it

2931
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:04,128
Learning

2932
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:06,432
At no point was

2933
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:10,016
Reading

2934
02:45:13,344 --> 02:45:13,856
Listening

2935
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:18,976
Communicating with people

2936
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:22,048
Sharing experiences

2937
02:45:23,072 --> 02:45:24,352
The empathic of others

2938
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:25,120
No chance

2939
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,168
It just

2940
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,704
Timmy is

2941
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:29,984
Capsulation of

2942
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,008
Someone who won't leave my

2943
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:32,800
Is

2944
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:37,152
Frustrated

02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,432
Learn

2946
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,200
Florida

2947
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:40,480
Learn

2948
02:45:41,504 --> 02:45:42,016
I just said

2949
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,208
You learn

2950
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:53,280
You know what

2951
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:54,304
DNA

2952
02:45:57,376 --> 02:45:58,656
You got one wrong

2953
02:45:58,912 --> 02:45:59,936
I think reveley

2954
02:46:01,472 --> 02:46:02,240
Memory

2955
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:04,799
Thanks

2956
02:46:06,847 --> 02:46:08,383
Them just talking about the branch

2957
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,151
List of idioms

2958
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:11,199
What

2959
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:17,855
Rob do accidentally

2960
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:21,183
Hitting the nail on the head of why I started

2961
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:24,767
Now they're talking about the mainstream media

2962
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:27,839
The match

2963
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:30,911
What he's talking about but about them

2964
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:36,031
Kind of clear up some of my motivation

2965
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:39,871
Every time we Face real

2966
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:42,431
It's not just delicious figure it out spread the word

2967
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:45,759
But it's like gorgeous Wild

2968
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:52,671
Other people decide you know what I got to step in

2969
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:54,719
That's usually how it happens

2970
02:46:55,999 --> 02:46:57,279
People get pushed so far

2971
02:46:59,071 --> 02:47:00,863
And at some point they go I've had enough

2972
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:03,423
What's your light in the sand

2973
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:05,471
How many times is our test

2974
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:06,495

And being intimidated by MSM or something

2976
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:21,087
She's a total coward on Facebook probably sockpuppet

2977
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:24,159
Calling you a racist

2978
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:25,439
First of all

2979
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:27,231
Perfect

2980
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:28,767
Solution of Y

IWatch

2983

The election night

2984

Everyone who is

2985
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:37,471
Was crying

2986
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:41,055
Laughing

2987
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,103
A very diverse crowd

2988
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:46,175
We realize our lives are in danger

2989
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,479
The things that Keep Us Alive

2990
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:50,527
Planned Parenthood

2991
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:53,599
Most basic example

2992
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:58,463
Immigration laws

2993
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,231
Can I am in danger

2994
02:47:59,743 --> 02:48:00,255
They were crying

2995
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:01,023
Legitimately

2996
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:06,399
In a room full of smoking cigars

2997
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:10,239
Absolute all the tears

2998
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:11,007
We're legit

2999
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:13,567
How many how many times do you have to

3000
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:14,591
Story up

3001
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:16,127
Children

3002
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:17,151
Separated for

3003
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:19,711
And because

3004
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,479
Because she

He's been deported

3006
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,831
Families broken up

3007
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:28,415
Really really

3008
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,207
Thumbs down

3009
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:31,999

3010
02:48:32,255 --> 02:48:32,767
Rule

3011
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:33,791
Yeah

3012
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:36,607
That was it that was it for me

3013
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:41,471
I watch that was the moment that robbed you just described as

3014
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:42,751
When I've had enough

3015
02:48:43,007 --> 02:48:43,775
That was the line

3016
02:48:45,567 --> 02:48:48,639
Alex Jones

3017
02:48:49,151 --> 02:48:52,223
I could have documented it before that

3018
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:53,247
Do you know what the life for me

3019
02:48:54,783 --> 02:49:00,415
For me was

3020
02:49:02,463 --> 02:49:08,607
I would love to have some sort of holy Crusader but I didn't have this

3021
02:49:08,863 --> 02:49:15,007
This idea you did for the ride the ride

3022
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:19,615
Pieces to an anti-Semitic

3023
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:25,503
I say Nazis are horrible working with Jewish Mafia

3024
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:27,551
Pulitzer Prize books

3025
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:30,879
SL the Jewish

3026
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:34,207
They're the ones that

3027
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:38,047
It's not like I have to sit there oh my God

3028
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:39,839
They're the ones like

3029
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:44,447
Dementia

3030
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:49,311
It doesn't matter

3031
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:54,431
Infowars.com live show in Fort Worth

3032
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:56,223
Do you know

3033
02:49:56,735 --> 02:49:57,503
What a piece of s***

3034
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:03,135
Associate

3035
02:50:04,927 --> 02:50:05,951
Get the taste out of our mouths

3036
02:50:06,207 --> 02:50:12,351
Weeks until

3037
02:50:12,863 --> 02:50:14,399
Okay I love them they're great folks

3038
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:17,215
But ship looks like the archetype

3039
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:19,263
Archetypal c*********

3040
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:22,847
With those little deer in the headlight eyes and all his stuff

3041
02:50:23,103 --> 02:50:24,895
And there's something about this

3042
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:29,247
Nothing around bossing everybody around trying to

3043
02:50:29,503 --> 02:50:31,039
I want to tell Congressman Schiff

3044
02:50:31,295 --> 02:50:32,319
And all the rest of them

3045
02:50:32,831 --> 02:50:38,975
Hey listen a****** quit saying Rodger and I

3046
02:50:39,231 --> 02:50:40,255
You son-of-a-b****

3047
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:42,303
What the f***** your problem

3048
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:45,887
You want to sit here and say that I'm a goddamn f****** Russians

3049
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:50,495
You piece of s***

3050
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,543
You f****** goddamn f*****

3051
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:54,079

Get that through your goddamn f****** head

3054
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:00,223
Pushing your s***

3055
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:06,623
You're the people that have his country over

3056
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:19,935
The reason I wanted to play that again is because it's so f****** awesome

3057
02:51:20,447 --> 02:51:26,591
I just want to illustrate we taking this entire episode

3058
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:28,639
I'm to the point where he's end of the night drunk

3059
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:31,967
I wanted to remind people that he started a run

3060
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:33,247
Started

3061
02:51:33,503 --> 02:51:34,271
He started

3062
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:39,135
Even drunk this entire time

3063
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:48,863
You are an alcoholic

3064
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:53,983
We like to make fun of you but I'd like to end this on actually a slight

3065
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:58,591
We just had that at the same time because we mean

3066
02:51:58,847 --> 02:52:01,151
Yeah you have a problem

3067
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:04,479
Empathy

3068
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:07,295
Somehow

3069
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:11,647
You should really turn your life

3070
02:52:14,975 --> 02:52:16,255
We've had issues of substance

3071
02:52:16,511 --> 02:52:17,279
Various time

3072
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:18,815
Myself

3073
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:22,143
And I've known people who

3074
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:23,423
Substance problems and

3075
02:52:23,935 --> 02:52:24,703
What is behaviors

3076
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:27,007
How to mirror

3077
02:52:27,263 --> 02:52:30,335
Give that crazy person that you know who has a drug problem

3078
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:35,711
A nationally syndicated radio show like this

3079
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:42,879
It's not really ethical to diagnose

3080
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:46,719
Mental illness

3081
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:47,743
No but I think

3082
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:49,023
Based on

3083
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:52,863
The sound that we heard of him drinking

3084
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:55,679
Hiding a cup under his desk

3085
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:58,239
His clearly drunk Behavior

3086
02:52:58,495 --> 02:53:01,055
Is drunk Behavior

3087
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:03,103
How wasted he was on Rogan

3088
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:03,871
Pinchot

3089
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:05,663
These are all indications

3090
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:08,223
She has a very serious problem

3091
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:12,063
And maybe some of these behaviors that we like to make fun of

3092
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:13,599
We should be

3093
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:14,367
Making fun of

3094
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:17,183
Some of them might have their route

3095
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:18,719
Since abuse problem

3096
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:23,327
As much of a Monster High

3097
02:53:27,423 --> 02:53:29,215
Absolutely

3098
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:32,031
Regret

3099
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:34,335
No absolutely not I'm just trying to

3100
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,359
Make this

3101
02:53:35,615 --> 02:53:36,127
Ferris

3102
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:36,895
Podcast

3103
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:38,687
Possible about Alex

3104
02:53:39,199 --> 02:53:41,503
If we are going to do that

3105
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:43,551
We have to recognize

3106
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:45,599
Then maybe he's not as bad of a

3107
02:53:45,855 --> 02:53:46,367
A person

3108
02:53:46,623 --> 02:53:47,647
Underneath that

3109
02:53:47,903 --> 02:53:48,927
If possible

3110
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:54,047
And it's never going to happen

3111
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:55,839
Help

3112
02:53:56,095 --> 02:53:56,607
We have to add

3113
02:53:57,887 --> 02:54:00,703
He's probably going to be fine

3114
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:01,471
Good

3115
02:54:01,983 --> 02:54:04,031
I honestly

3116
02:54:08,383 --> 02:54:09,663
Buckhead

3117
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:10,687
He did get help

3118
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:12,223
And he stopped doing his show

3119
02:54:12,735 --> 02:54:13,759
That would ruin the

3120
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:14,527
The show

3121
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:17,855
We can transition to Michael Savage

3122
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:20,415
Like there's 100 reviews

3123
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:21,183
You're right

3124
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:22,975
And they're all

3125
02:54:23,231 --> 02:54:24,255
Equally easy

3126
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:29,119
Just like point out where they're lying

3127
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:31,679
A****** conservative

3128
02:54:31,935 --> 02:54:33,471

3129
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:38,847
