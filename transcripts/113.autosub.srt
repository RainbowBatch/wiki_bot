Novelty beverages

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Little bit

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
About Alex Jones

00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Dim

00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
The sphere of the Immortals

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
This may be our last show of

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,464
Team possible we might be another show down the road but that might be it

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
If

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
You were to describe

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
To it

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
Over the past year what would you do

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,960
Describe

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
Hair growing really long

17
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
That's true

18
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,576
And the guy who just turned his beard does not know everything about owls are related

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
Bowlero

20
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
That's what we're going to do this may be the last episode of the Year might not be either way

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Is coming up

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912

Happy holidays Merry Christmas to y'all go ahead

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Bouncebreak.com is our website and click support the show all of you already have done and are doing it

27
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
But we really want to

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
You know what

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,024
Cam girls have goddamn don't they have like

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
I don't think it would help but it would just be like

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Normal food

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Send me some lingerie if you want me to wear it it's like

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Struggles of my life is I really love doing

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,648
No it's that it's that I love doing this and I would I don't want to not be doing this but I realized it

35
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,000
Conceivably jacking off on cam I might make more money than mine

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Yeah

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,192
True

38
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
All about

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Break in the action right there

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
Cuz we just said I got distracted by doctor poodle Papa on the other chat room email

41
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Because he offered to mail Us blind

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,632
Get back about that I think that might be too expensive on your rent to be worth

43
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,752
I'll send you an email I apologize for not getting back to you at this point

44
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
At least then we know we'll eat

45
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
There's been a little bit of you know I've been depressed the last week and a half or so

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
In terms of keeping

47
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
Things going I apologize but some

48
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Disruption

49
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,904
A couple days where I barely been able to get out of bed and no that's just

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Sometimes you got to got to roll with it

51
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Move forward

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
Better now

53
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,960
I'll be a lot of fun anyway

54
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Let's get to the

55
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
We needed to end the year

56
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,408
And I didn't want it to end the year I feel like this year's been so great

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,528
You just let it ride

58
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
You know based on the Gregorian calendar

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Yes

60
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Year zero on the Gregorian

61
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
So that means it

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
True but be that as it may I didn't want to do a New Year's episode or anything like that. That would be a little bit old hat

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Hockey

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
So I decided against

65
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
The master

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
The failure on our part

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Boy should have been fun

68
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Thinking about it it's

69
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Play call man

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
It's

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
The fifth anniversary of disposing Maya Mayan apocalypse

72
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
Like that we already did that episode

73
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,768
What are we going to do

74
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
What's bigger than 2017 the buying apocalypse

75
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
You know I was like

76
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
Don't know what to do until I just threw a dart

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
I threw a random Dart

78
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Into the past

79
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,079
And thankfully I hit Pay Dirt

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,967
I Hitler I did I did I darted Hitler

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Not kill just like

82
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
He was annoyed

83
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,695
Regular

84
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,023
Pretending

85
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Beginning

86
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Of the

87
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Russia

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Premier

89
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
Alright which was on I believe the 20th of February

90
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
2014

91
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Yes

92
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,175
And so that's what I jump back to I definitely

93
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Calendar

94
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
I jumped back to the 21st

95
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
February 2014

96
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Happy Valentines

97
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Probably give her take today

98
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
What is position

99
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,399
And

100
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Here's what I found

101
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
On the 21st

102
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
He spends about

103
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
The first

104
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
40 minutes talking about how Obama is about

105
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
To take him over

106
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,783
About to take him down

107
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Asteroid

108
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
The entire media is a

109
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Rickover

110
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
It would have been a very interesting

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Obama's

112
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Russia Annex

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
Crimea was to be like

114
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,631
51st state beaches who's annexing who now

115
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Or

116
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,287
I'm going to take out Alex

117
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Either one of those would be

118
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
Cooley likely Obama's out-of-office

119
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
So he didn't take down the media didn't attack

120
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
That at all at all

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Beatbox Alex a little bit

122
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
I mean that's fair play

123
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
But

124
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
First 40 minutes was boring

125
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Intel

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
I got to this clip

127
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
How's like

128
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
No

129
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Quantify

130
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
But I believe the Human Experience

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Quantify

132
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
I want to hear from you

133
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Where what are you doing

134
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Oh yeah

135
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Okay three calls

136
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
We're not even going to get to the calls

137
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
3 minutes of little bit more time

138
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
11:45

139
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,271
11 minutes and 45 seconds Auto read about The Human Experience

140
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
And it's one of the craziest

141
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,647
I've ever heard I have a lot of things that I can

142
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
Specifically point out that he's lying about that we're going to get through firebreak by krump

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Commercial to commercial

144
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
Evan when he does take calls there's like

145
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,775
So here is where the the ramp begin

146
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
In fairness to Alex

147
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Start off on a good foot

148
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
It's not

149
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,503
Great but there are some things in this first two minutes of the rain

150
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
That I can call

151
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Time to sign off on

152
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
That changes quick

153
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Alright

154
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
On this Friday the 21st

155
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
I want to talk about the nature of

156
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,223
Individually have a feeling like we've been here forever

157
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,599
We're never going to be overconfident I don't get older

158
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
Buildings in Tulsa

159
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
The language and customs

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
Thousands of years

161
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
Develop on this planet

162
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Real quick I don't know if he's saying

163
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
You as an

164
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
Individual take you have been around

165
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Alex talking about

166
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Externalizing

167
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
You saying that you Jordan individual think

168
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
You Jordan have been around for a long time

169
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Humanity

170
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Okay

171
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Well I would like in the history of the Earth

172
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
The traditional expressionism

173
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
You consider the

174
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Entire lifespan

175
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
The Earth

176
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Relatively speaking

177
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
No we have not

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
But

179
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Compared to our experience

180
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Which is really the most

181
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Real thing to us

182
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,807
Don't jump the gun

183
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
With our species

184
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
And the Rites of Passage in the archetype of ritual

185
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
TV show comforting Dodge

186
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Great great great great great

187
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
* 100

188
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,055
Live in a time where those rituals and those rights

189
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
And scientifically dissolve

190
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
And replaced with rituals

191
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
Consciousness depression

192
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,935
To the mainline cosmology Sports

193
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,287
And the drama and the movies and the celebrity

194
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,895
999 99

195
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Someday

196
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
The Fulfillment box

197
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Call fulfillment in the human process

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
So

199
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Is the part that I'm talking

200
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
I do agree with his thoughts about celeb

201
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
Pretty worship

202
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,735
A lot of people get trapped up in the glitz

203
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,575
And the glamour of the movie industry in Hollywood

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,183
And even reality television is guilty of this to some extent or Alex Jones in my

205
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Mike X caught up in something

206
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Becomes overwhelming

207
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
To other parts of your life

208
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
But that bothers

209
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Do people

210
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Really believe that

211
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Human being

212
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
100000 years ago

213
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Didn't get

214
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Bored

215
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
They did

216
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
I like generally if you're talking about a hun

217
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Hunter-gatherers

218
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Society

219
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
What we know from bone density in the way that we've

220
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Discovered those fossils

221
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Is that a lot of time there

222
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Starved

223
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,671
Sure Save the timer for a week

224
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Fatty foods

225
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
So you're hunting your Gathering

226
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
But your leg

227
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,935
S*** there's nothing a hunter-gatherer and we're just hanging out

228
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Like

229
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
Don't you think they wish

230
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
They wish

231
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
They could have had

232
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Analicia and Sport

233
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
The Nintendo switch

234
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
If you brought them in time

235
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Time and have them play the

236
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
The switch

237
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Like the hunting part of it is exciting

238
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Gathering

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Kind of boring

240
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
So even like half of the population

241
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Female have

242
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
Are still living

243
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Idea

244
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Of cavemen

245
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
For like 4 days

246
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
The Gathering part is pretty interested to

247
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
I do I don't know

248
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
I don't know what interesting

249
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
Contacts

250
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
Maybe I'll check this out there's another piece

251
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
Seafood

252
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Food to eat

253
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Not boring

254
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Lowe's sand

255
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
People play

256
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
It's equally as exciting as words with

257
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
You and I played Scrabble don't forget

258
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
I've had gallery

259
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,895
I wish I wouldn't consider it exciting together

260
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
Anyway well this is why you're boring

261
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Rigorous

262
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Undefeatable

263
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,559
I still think that there is a kernel of something in there

264
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Making a bigger deal out of this than I need to

265
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
Do just because of how off the rails this is going to get kind of have a hinge key around like

266
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
The Fulfillment of the human process

267
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Ryan

268
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
You're better than this

269
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
Your beard celebrity

270
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
I mean argue though

271
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Depends on who were talking about

272
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Anyway

273
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
A lot of people have

274
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Subscription to Cosmo

275
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
Nothing

276
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:58,399
So it's just going to be over

277
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Starts

278
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
The Arctic

279
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
Epigenetics on record

280
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,991
The strongest arguments

281
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Restart it

282
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
What do you mean what the f*** is he talkin about some developers theme and then we'll talk about it

283
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
What was the first

284
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Epigenetics take notes and then the Panthers

285
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
Question

286
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
The Arctic

287
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,199
Epigenetics on record

288
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,319
Mammal species

289
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
Watch a movie from

290
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
5000 years ago

291
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,095
What do you think all these instincts come from your door

292
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,239
Why is there a

293
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Is there

294
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
Generations

295
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
The indoors with no stimuli

296
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
And have a cloud go over projected on the ceiling

297
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
Generations later

298
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Project the cloud project

299
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Away from you

300
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,639
In the neuron repair

301
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,831
All the ancients

302
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
Tissue spaces

303
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Where we are individuals

304
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Group Collective

305
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Organism

306
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
That a sixth sense level

307
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,223
Island

308
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
On the next Island

309
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
100 200 times faster

310
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
Model

311
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Morphic resonance

312
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
No one knows fault there's a lot going on here

313
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
People do know what that is

314
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
No one knows

315
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
There's alot going on

316
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
You want to start with

317
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
First of all I mean

318
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
The stuff about fears like

319
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Generations

320
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,255
Mulatto

321
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
The amount of research that I'm able to do with my

322
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Non Masters Degree in the in the subject is a process called methylation

323
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
Where in

324
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Pieces of the DNA or actually chain

325
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
It's like metal pieces are attached

326
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Strand

327
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
And they are able to

328
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Track through this

329
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
This process what happened

330
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
Like I didn't experiment rap

331
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Where they actually

332
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
With the gas or the

333
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
They used as a

334
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Trigger for the rat

335
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
I gave them the smell and that electric

336
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Shocked them

337
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
And then future Generations

338
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Would be scared of Justice

339
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Smile it's because of DNA methylation

340
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,055
Genes are actually sort of warped

341
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Behaviorally

342
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
It's it's not like

343
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
I don't fully understand

344
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
That's what I

345
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
I think those parts

346
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
New Orleans

347
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
Is Tapatio

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
You know that thing we thought 30 years ago

349
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Doesn't make sense

350
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
Right but it would make sense

351
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
Generations later chicken

352
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Still have that

353
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Every existing

354
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
Chicken before then

355
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,431
Gene Wordament fully Express

356
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Savers

357
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Organism

358
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Things that can learn throughout

359
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Adapt

360
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
To that as well

361
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Stronger person

362
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Person doing a stronger

363
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Does mate mean

364
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
So I would assume

365
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Different generation

366
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,399
Allow you to reproduce

367
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Efficiently

368
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Where you at

369
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Where am I at

370
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
So explain to me

371
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
What he thinks Apple

372
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Genetics is

373
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
He thinks that's a good point I maybe think it's because

374
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Genetic predetermination

375
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
4 rings

376
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
The study

377
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Seems to be

378
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Some sort of a genetic component

379
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Addictions that are past

380
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
If your Dad drunk

381
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,175
You're probably with your Dad drunk you drink

382
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
I think that sentence

383
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Yeah

384
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Alrighty

385
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Now

386
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Which

387
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Sages

388
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Have been proved

389
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
Just like

390
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Sage Francis

391
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,351
I don't know I don't I don't know anything

392
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
Epigenetics

393
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
The Elder Pliny the Elder

394
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
Come on if your dad break you

395
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
The other thing at the end is this enough monkeys and then Magic

396
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
These other monkey

397
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Across the pond

398
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Are going to

399
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
To have that that behavior

400
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,583
Well that was

401
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
Adventure

402
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Something called morphic

403
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
There was a

404
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
He's a kidnapper like a crow

405
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
That learned how to use it

406
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Island

407
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,247
That had no recorded

408
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Whatever it's called Contact

409
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Haha

410
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
They learned it within a week or

411
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
They thought of it you know the thought there is

412
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Well

413
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
But it could also just been

414
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
But that's not what he's talking about you

415
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
I have

416
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
What's up well there's this

417
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
There's this belief

418
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
If you show me a dick

419
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
I want

420
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,223
There's a there's this belief that goes around in like pseudoscience

421
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Difficult

422
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Is it called the hundred month

423
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
That is very few teach enough monkeys a behavior all other monkey

424
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
These will start to learn it

425
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
And it's supposedly based on science

426
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
Albany

427
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
So I'll just going to read you here

428
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
From from

429
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Article about this

430
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
The story of the hundredth monkey effect

431
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Was published by Lyle Watson

432
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
Forward to Lawrence Blair's rhythms of vision

433
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
19 7

434
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
35

435
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
And spread with the appearance of Lawton

436
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
1979 book life tied

437
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
The account is that unidentified

438
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Conducting a study of macaque monkeys

439
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
In the Japanese island of Kashima in 90

440
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Fifteen52

441
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
These scientists observe that some of these monkeys learn

442
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Turn to wash sweet potatoes

443
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
And gradually this new Behavior spread through the younger generation

444
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
The Monkees

445
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
In the usual fashion

446
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
Observation through observation

447
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Watson

448
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
Concluded that the researchers observed that wants

449
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Monkeys

450
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
I even hundred

451
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
This previously learned behavior

452
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
Instantly spread across the water to other monkeys

453
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Nearby Islands

454
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Anywhere where those monkey

455
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
If there was a small sub

456
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Right

457
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Then that knowledge

458
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Would then be

459
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Transmitted

460
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
Do all monkeys around the world within that space

461
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,728
That is the idea that there is a threshold

462
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
This is an idea

463
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Theosophy

464
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,664
Community Center

465
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Everyone will benefit from it

466
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Because this consciousness

467
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:50,112
Sprint it's almost magical Malcolm Gladwell is what your

468
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Lincoln talks about how late we get Malcolm Gladwell

469
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Sure

470
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Anybody

471
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,072
Unsubstantiated claims that there was a sudden that remarkable increase in

472
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
The proportion of sweet potato

473
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
The first population

474
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Exaggeration

475
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
To the much slower more mundane effect

476
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
Rather than all monkeys mysteriously learning the skills

477
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
It was noted that it was

478
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
Predominantly younger monkeys that learned

479
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Observational learning

480
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Which is widespread in

481
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,576
Know how to wash the food potatoes

482
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Not to learn

483
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Younger monkeys were born

484
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
The proportion of washers naturally increase

485
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
The time span between observations by the Japanese

486
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Who's on the order of years

487
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,400
So the increase in proportion was not observed

488
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
So all this is bulshit

489
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
But then beyond that

490
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Claims that the practice was watching

491
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Sweet potato spread suddenly

492
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,688
The other isolated populations of monkeys Maybe

493
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Sweet potato washing monkey

494
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
He swam to another population

495
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
It's been about 4 years there and also

496
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
The monkeys had researchers and comment

497
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
Also like a sweet potato

498
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,984
Who is Jordan swimming all the way across

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
It also turns out the

500
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,872
Potatoes are not like they weren't to Native Foods

501
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
Eid

502
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
Know how to prepare them

503
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:25,088
Is completely reasonable that have to figure it out that after the older generation

504
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Typing

505
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,208
Lower proportion theory is b*******

506
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
That way you know how old people can't

507
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Take a f******

508
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Screenshot on their phone

509
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
True

510
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
That's that's not a hundredth monkey

511
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:43,264
Reply

512
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,408
Who cares

Indus plain

514
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,088
Starting to espouse his beliefs about race memory

515
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Completely

516
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
What epigenetics

517
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,024
This is no idea by DNA methylation

518
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,608
He has no idea that the hundredth monkey theory is

519
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Bumpus Bumpus

520
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
As they say

521
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
British fiction

522
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,056
And as far as race memory goes he doesn't even know Husain Bolt

523
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
1008

524
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640

Rituals of manhood

529
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,520
I don't want you to go through

530
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Free will

531
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
But there's so many levels to Ry

532
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
How many systems

533
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
And with other people

534
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,920
People

535
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,504
Performing

536
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,096
For us to succeed

537
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
That's not a generation

538
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,016
Only one

539
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,904
Sign off on everything

540
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
In this corrupt system to survive and treachery is what is empowered them

541
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,472
Guns N Roses

543
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Okay

544
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
Posit that it's not the

545
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Human Experience

546
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Alex's

547
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
Mentally ill possibly brain-damaged

548
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
I'm liking it

549
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
So I know it's interesting it's much more interesting that is bigotry that's for damn sure even though there's a par

550
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,912
A hundred percent

551
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Still way more interesting to me than is normal knockout game narrative

552
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,920
You're just like your father or mother

553
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
But he's too esoteric at this point in the episode

554
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
To get into the narrative this is high-level stuff he's got a mention epigenetics

555
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
This is not time

556
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
4 Brown Bags being outlawed the Purple Penguin

557
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
What's your favorite ritual

558
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
Everybody up and then back in a bunch of young lady

559
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Before I'm 6

560
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,568
And then getting thrown out of school for fighting too much and smoking crack twice on a beach

561
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
I don't know

562
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Maybe graduating

563
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
High School

564
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,296
It's going to take awhile

565
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,648
I don't know

566
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
I don't think it's

567
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,584
I don't think it's fair for me to critique what the Rites of Passage for women or I didn't have that lifx.

568
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Come on man

569
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,776
That's good you trying to sell me up the river like that problem

570
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,104
Suddenly pick up tomato crosskill

571
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
I was wrong I have never I have never claimed to be a saint

572
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't know man I think his view of the Rites of Passage or Slightly Stoopid special

573
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Based on the things that

574
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
We know of his life

575
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
If we if we consider the possibility that

576
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Is telling the truth about his

577

You broke ways with his mom

578

Individuated Italy

579
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
Like age six when she told him he didn't get love anymore

580
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
It's not the healthy time

581
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
Is that right

582
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:41,760
6 years old very much connection with your parents in order to contextualize the world

583
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:47,392
Around 6 baby

584
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
Is your lifespan

585
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,792
Alright passage baby picking up some

586
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Wildly

587
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Somatic John Birch

588
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
Society style beliefs that night about 12

589
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Right I don't know

590
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Or like a like walk in the cornfields

591
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Sure pulling weeds

592
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Let's drink

593
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
It is all stuff

594
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Admitted

595
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
We're part of his childhood

596
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,416
I don't think those are healthy right the past

597
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
Everyone else

598
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Here's my

599
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
First

600
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Big red flag

601
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
All right we need to go to the store

602
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Right

603
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
That's important

604
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,128
It's important to the ancestors who has wells in his bosom as well as the Creator

605
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
But at the same time the Creator actually is not waiting

606
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
At the same time

607
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
We have

608
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,344
To the rituals of those old people of

609
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
Tribal days

610
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,744
Does he think that if we can

611
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
We'll just like

612
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Start float

613
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
Like we'll just get up there what will be like I ran out of berries over here so might as well check out the moon

614
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,896
Holding on to the Past

615
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Well

616
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,016
Progressive

617
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,368
Straight up OSHA

618
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Text clip Alex

619
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Gets more into the right to

620
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
The passage

621
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
Drive to cite a poem

622
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
Oh boy

623
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Oh boy

624
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,144
100-yard dash

625
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
Explosively in the world

626
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
And the trials and tribulations

627
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,392
And you're bombarded

628
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
Generations

629
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,448
300 Alamo

630
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:13,056
All the billions of experience is all the legends

631
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,896
McReynolds

632
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Lykan hypersport

633
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
This one was bald

634
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
This one was lucky

635
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
And for a brief moment

636
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,536
The Hills Mall

637
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Dauntless

638
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Lifted

639
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,944
Losing the thread that's what it's all about ladies and gentlemen

640
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
His favorite poem

641
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
July

642
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,416
I've never really taken the time to look at it so I looked into it a little bit this time

643
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
The thing about Rites of Passage

644
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
And stuff like that

645
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
And I think that he thinks

646
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Childe Roland

647
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
The Dark Tower came

648
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Does the name of the poem

649
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Robert Browning

650
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Yeah and

651
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,592
I think that he thinks child rolande means baby roll on

652
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
And it doesn't

653
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
Child

654
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,992
That is the word not for a child it means

655
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Goodnight

656
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,576
The old time

657
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
Also Robert Browning

658
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Also

659
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Not good at it

660
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Hero long poems

661
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
It wasn't short I did read the whole poem

662
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
He gets into like a f******

663
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
8 page long poem

664
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,080
Came up on like translating The Iliad

665
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Chat

666
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Vermont map

667
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:02,880
So I read I read the childe Roland to The Dark Tower came

668
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
Actually really interesting cuz I think there's some connect

669
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Pens with Alex

670
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,048
In the poem that he doesn't realize

671
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,656
Okay so one of the first things about it is it's not about

672
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Rite of passage

673
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,800
Give that all of the great Heroes of

674
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
The vold

675
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Pierre to Roland

676
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
Goes to the Dark Tower

677
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Complete this rite of passage

678
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,344
On the phone about art and poetry you can have your own interpretation in

679
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Alex's could be

680
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
True to him

681
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,256
Hey that's not what those people read

682
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Awesome

683
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Margaret Atwood

684
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
Who is the famous

685
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Razor

686
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
And also the debts

687
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
What's the name of my cat

688
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Before I adopted

689
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
I believe the poem

690
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
Child Rolanda's actually Robert Browning

691
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Self

692
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
And that the Dark Tower is

693
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
Of writing

694
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
The poem the movie by

695
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
No

696
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
The Dark Tower

697
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
No no no I mean that is probably what

698
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Obviously

699
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm derailing you soon getting serious

700
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
Let's do it

701
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
Which is actually side

702
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Salseo

703
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
What time

704
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Call child

705
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
It is actually the

706
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Protagonist from

707
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
The song OverWatch

708
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Who is

709
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
Margaret Atwood's theory is that it

710
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
You know there is a lot of

711
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
You're within the

712
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
The poem

713
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,768
And it's the Dark Tower is BS like the act of writing

714
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Poem

715
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
Is what he is working

716
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
His way towards Indy

717
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
He's afraid of

718
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
Okay so there's that there other interpretation

719
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Think about it being a knight

720
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Requested with a

721
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
The end of the tower symbolizes

722
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
And it's accepted all they come

723
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Your failure

724
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Or realization

725
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Futile

726
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
I don't know I don't really like poetry that much

727
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
But what are the things I did notice while reading

728
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Poem

729
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Do you want to start

730
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
Yeah I do I do

731
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
I noticed

732
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
Trimmed it does

733
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
Story of the poem is child Rolanda

734
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Going

735
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
At the beginning he gets told by this old weirdo

736
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,496
He's got to go do this thing or whatever this guy

737
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,568
How many goes on his way

738
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Fields

739
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Can you find this Tower

740
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Joseph Campbell

741
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Hero's journey

742
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
You are somewhat but he goes along the way

743
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,320
Nothing happened in the entire time

744
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
But it's full of like

745
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
Oh my God this River could be full of dead bodies

746
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
Like the entire time

747
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
It's just made up bulshit

748
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
What it could to be a stroll in the woods

749
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
That could be what the literal

750
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Buddy's mythologize visit

751
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
Since you like this crazy

752
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Z-Trip to

753
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
Battle

754
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
Right it's not

755
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Right it's not the

756
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
He's rewriting

757
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
His own story in order to make it more interesting

758
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Exactly

759
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:16,672
Eddie gets the tower there's no indication that there's a battle there anything like that

760
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,744
He does say read this year off

761
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
To view the last

762
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
List of Mia living frame for one more picture

763
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
In a sheet of flame

764
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
I saw them and I knew them all.

765
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
The Slughorn to my lips I said

766
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
And blue child roll on

767
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
Into The Dark Tower

768
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
In the same way

769
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
No don't listen

770
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
Lockhorn

771
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Like

772
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
They've named a lot of boats

773
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
A ship in Star Trek

774
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
In the same way he's Imagining the entire trip there is being full of

775
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Trotwood

776
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Imagining

777
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
These people there

778
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
The point

779
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
And the poem

780
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
No but there's a point in the poem

781
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,712
Or he doesn't really want to go anymore

782
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
Don't really want to keep going

783
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
And I'll just read you this

784
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
See what you think

785
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Is being described

786
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Not at

787
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
Cuthbert

788
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,328
Beneath its garniture of curly golldir fellow till I almost felt him fold

789
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
An arm in mine to fix me to the place

790
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
The way heater

791
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Alas one nightstand

792
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Disgrace

793
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,776
Out with my heart's new fire and left

794
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
Did cold

795
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Was he described in there

796
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,480
He's talking about buying a dude he is talking about bringing a pretty sure he's being held

797
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,576
Gently by a dude and then it's a

798
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Extinguish

799
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
1 nights

800
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Disgrace you got it

801
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,464
The school of on Earth

802
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
Frank is 10 years ago when knighted first

803
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
What honest man should dare you

804
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
He Durst

805
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Good but the

806
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
The steamship

807
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
What hangman hands

808
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Vintage brass tap parking

809
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
His only ban

810
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Read it for traitor

811
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Spit upon and curse

812
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,408
So he's remembering a night that was really Noble

813
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
Killed for treason

814
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
Better this present than a past like that

815
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
Back there for to my darkening

816
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Half again

817
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
So

818
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
What he goes on

819
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,256
To actually get to get along on his imaginary Quest

820
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Is

821
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Oh s*** my past I bang that dude

822
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,168
And even heroes end up sometimes being

823
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Turning out to be

824
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
So he's running from a

825
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Like a path

826
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
TDM's dishonorable

827
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Or whatever let you know that that is

828
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
He's running from shame and

829
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Beer

830
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
Towards and imagine

831
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
So anyway what I mean

832
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
Section of the poem do what

833
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Interpretation

834
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Would be is more

835
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
By quitting Quest

836
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
I would be

837
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,120
The traitor problem as opposed to he is running away from back

838
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Dude

839
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
The dude

840
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
KeyBank

841
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Is

842
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,032
More just like I could hang out and be with this

843
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,640
Remembering this traitor

844
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Because I would rather

845
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
You know that whole

846
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
I have to stay true to my quest

847
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
These two stamp

848
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
Our memories

849
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
And that it says

850
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Fetters

851
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
Present vennie past like

852
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
So even though there does seem

853
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Need some Warp

854
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
When he's talking about Cuthbert

855
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
He's still

856
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,656
Saying I would rather have this fearful

857
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
We are present then

858
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
The past

859
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
I know a lot about post let's get off this really likes

860
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Specified what I'm talking about it

861
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
Alex Jones is made up a fictionalized Mythic Quest

862
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:00,928
You've been on for the last 20 years or whatever he's going towards

863
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Some sort of a legend

864
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,792
He's going towards self imaginary Finish Line

865
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Heroics

866
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
But he thinks

867
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
He is this guy going to

868
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Tubus Dark Tower

869
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Just imagine

870
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
The entire thing

871
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
And what propels

872
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Ten-forward possibly is

873
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Some sort of Shame

874
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
Not necessarily about

875
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
But some sort of Shame

876
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
Still unclear about

877
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Very gentle

878
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Fimbriae

879
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,048
You are all those people that came before you

880
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
The Consciousness you got dying and the rituals

881
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,175
Carried out by our ancestors not being carried out into the future because even those rituals are needed

882
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Sociology

883
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,879
You need those two

884
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
None of those things

885
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,279
Closet

886
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,583
WWE

887
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,239
Compressed data information

888
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
What are you talking about like

889
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
Compressible

890
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,319
Well you're going to need like WinRAR zip

891
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
Program and that's not really a ritual

892
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,975
No it's the ritual the Rites of Passage

893
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Right

894
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Again

895
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
Based on what I know of his past

896
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
I would say it's not

897
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
The rights of

898
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
They unlocked

899
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Box like this and

900
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
His brain as much as

901
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,199
What means being stuck under a house being fumigated

902
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
Along these lines

903
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
Probably make it difficult

904
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Reading

905
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
He's got like a half remembrance of

906
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
Half of something that maybe was true

907
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
Ready ready

908
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
In the title

909
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,263
6% of junk DNA that scientist

910
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
No one's ever said that colloquial b******* about you use 10% of your brain that was a long ghost

911
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,831
One of those popular ideas from your head like

912
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
The guy wear

913
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
Thermal clothing but he did wear a hat

914
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Well of course all the heat escapes

915
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
From your head

916
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
No you just

917
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
You didn't cover your head

918
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Uncovered place

919
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
It's very

920
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Confusing

921
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
Cuz I mean he's trying to stop up what do you want like what do you want

922
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Basalt

923
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Have been about

924
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
Yeah this point I think

925
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Pouting

926
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Pseudoscience

927
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Debunked studies

928
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Probable misinterpretation

929
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Childe Roland to The Dark Tower came

930
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
A bunch of made-up Chiswell

931
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Yeah and it's a

932
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
B b

933
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,791
Not till the end but it actually becomes really

934
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,143
Because it brings back towards the real world

935
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
Confusing he brings it back towards the real world

936
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
I just don't know what do you mean

937
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:33,151
I want to get confused all of those struggles and all of that information to go to the Future

938
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,759
Information

939
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,343
Reality

940
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,511
Think about how

941
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
Lisinopril

942
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
And want to embrace you

943
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,031
Before you are re-uploaded

944
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,407
Real

945
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,759
Level

946
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
That's what I understand

947
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
The surest way to living forever

948
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
True

949
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
Development

950
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:43,039
Knowledge On to the Next Generation and the build-up

951
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
Young of the future

952
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
I agree that that is important

953
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,207
Now it's also important

954
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Information

955
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Don't loving information

956
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
Should be

957
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
Correct what we're really saying

958
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Is

959
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
Don't allow Alex Jones's kids

960
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
Have kids that's the only real way to

961
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Kill Alex

962
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Epigenetically

963
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,455
Epigenetically

964
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,319
It's through the artist through the literature through all of these things that live on it sir

965
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
But don't watch movie

966
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:24,255
Don't look all art is made by

967
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,143
Globalist we leave on to block the path

968
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
But we got to stay back there otherwise the past

969
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Isn't going to allow us to get

970
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
To the Future

971
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
But doesn't make a goddamn bit of sense

972
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
What the f*** is

973
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
You talkin

974
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
I'm not sure if everything is it

975
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,503
Let's Mysteries

976
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
That's the mysteries of the museum Mysteries

977
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Oh s***

978
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
We are the m

979
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
This is the great truth

980
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
Hold your family

981
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
This is why you have a conscience

982
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
It's good for Humanity

983
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,783
And the global is come with a counterfeit

984
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
Because we are collective

985
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
Collectivism

986
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,719
To help Humanity when they're actually centralized

987
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,559
Parasites that hate Humanity

988
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
Shutter and block

989
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,191
And the in the ears

990
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Of humanity

991
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,639
We are individuals

992
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
Of April

993
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,783
And free will

994
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,135
Association

995
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
Association

996
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,399
Future

997
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
This is The Human Experience

998
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
This is the great goal

999
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Not Hollywood

1000
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,919
None of it

1001
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,039
Building a true World building a better World building a free world

1002
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
Based on honor

1003
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
Our fathers and our mothers that came before us

1004
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
No answer

1005
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,911
Usual 2014

1006
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
REI

1007
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,543
So what are the things that I want to talk about there is

1008
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
The use of the word

1009
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
Free association over and over

1010
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
Cuz you do free association

1011
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
Largely a

1012
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Marxist

1013
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Communist

1014
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Anarchist

1015
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
It's motive

1016
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
No no no

1017
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,231
Don't look free-association if you're just talking about

1018
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
The right to assemble

1019
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
And stuff like that

1020
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Zendesk

1021
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,423
In the First Amendment and that's never that's not really in French

1022
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,031
Other versions

1023
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
The free association

1024
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Like you know

1025
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,639
Unions are very in the conversation

1026
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,199
Free association

1027
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
No Global it's false collect

1028
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,831
Activism are using to try and block

1029
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
Your real for you so see

1030
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Which is

1031
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
Discovering that your father and mother are at

1032
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
You

1033
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,559
But I mean only your father cuz your mother is

1034
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Really not a bow

1035
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
Think is what Alex Jones believes

1036
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Only women

1037
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,775
Mothers are associated with free help generation

1038
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
Yeah I don't

1039
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,383
Who is like workers

1040
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
People who make money

1041
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Off of work

1042
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
Map of Labor

1043
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
Have a relationship that is

1044
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Is not

1045
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,599
Advances are really freely associate

1046
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,927
If they forced Association based on me

1047
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
To sell my labor right order to

1048
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
To survive

1049
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
And therefore the person with

1050
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
The capital

1051
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
To use my labor has

1052
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:17,727
Essentially control he has control over by association of control over

1053
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
What is my my life

1054
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,615
By the way

1055
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,663
O'Hare went on strike support

1056
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Here here

1057
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,415
Free association would be the former Society created if private property was abolished

1058
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
In order to allow individuals

1059
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
Freely dispose of them

1060
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
The production which would bring about the end of

1061
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:47,167
The class Society I know more owners neither proletarian

1062
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Northstate

1063
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
But only freely associated

1064
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
So pure free association

1065
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
Requires

1066
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
The destruction of private property

1067
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
Which is something that I know that Alex is

1068
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,247
420

1069
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Really

1070
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Basic

1071
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
Free association

1072
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Concept I guess

1073
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,159
What's covered in the first

1074
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
Which is cool I guess but I

1075
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,839
If I if I understand what he's talking about and I will not claim to

1076
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,143
He goes to open carry marches

1077
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,215
Like he goes he goes on marches where they make public.

1078
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,567
Displays of just having their guns out

1079
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
Lesbian

1080
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Taken away from him

1081
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
He can have whatever political group you want

1082
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,783
You can get on the radio and start opal it occult

1083
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
If you want

1084
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
I think what

1085
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
He's really describing

1086
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
If if I am

1087
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Is

1088
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
Everybody should live

1089
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
With giant

1090
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
They never see anybody unless you

1091
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
You choose to see

1092
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
Yeah probably that's essentially what he

1093
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
He's describing their

1094
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
This idea of like

1095
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,871
Collectivist false collectivism

1096
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Is

1097
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Cities

1098
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,831
Yeah yeah but you know that with all those people

1099
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
He's afraid of

1100
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
He's afraid of

1101
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
That is kind of what it is only once

1102
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,047
Do it this is all all that he is just said

1103
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,911
I am afraid

1104
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
From what I'm hearing from you is free

1105
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,287
For him is the right to not associate with some

1106
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,335
Boom as opposed to the

1107
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,663
Term as it actually exists

1108
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,503
Hundred percent is the case then

1109
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
His argument

1110
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
A free association

1111
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Is not really

1112
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Free association

1113
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
If you don't want to be associated with someone like

1114
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:49,791
Like me because let's say you don't want to be associated with cross-eyed people

1115
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:55,679
I have no freedom in that bit on record

1116
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Rule

1117
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Is it stupid

1118
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,591
He's full of nonsense but I do like that he accidentally is advocating for Marxist

1119
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,943
If I if you actually knew what he was talking about

1120
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
So

1121
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
Is that such a

1122
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
And then

1123
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
So brilliant

1124
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Regards

1125
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
To Alex Jones's

1126
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Operating

1127
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Insofar as

1128
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
This version of collectivism

1129
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Whatever it is

1130
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
I am saying is collectivism

1131
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Is correct

1132
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,311
Everybody says there's a different version

1133
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Collectivism

1134
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Is the global

1135
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
Ownership

1136
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Completely

1137
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
Of the word

1138
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
It's Christmas

1139
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
It is Chris

1140
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,695
Look at the chat sadly

1141
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:57,887
With those humanized I am not a fish person I glanced from time to time I like to

1142
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,935
Baltimore but we don't have time

1143
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
We have our own world

1144
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,543
I apologize if you guys feel

1145
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591

Like I said

1149
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:20,927
This weird-ass 303 payoff for us

1150
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
Totally

1151
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,791
No no I was like no more 45 minutes

1152
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:30,655
Spirit of esoteric Alex on the 21st

1153
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
And then we got a new

1154
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,519
On the 23rd we have a new Alex

1155
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,079
The 21st was Friday the 23rd is Sunday

1156
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Man

1157
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
F******

1158
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,479
Really like Alex on the 23rd

1159
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Spoiler alert

1160
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,319
Okay I think that in a different life

1161
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
Alex Jones

1162
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Could have been

1163
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
3D amazing

1164
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
At certain things

1165
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
Alright

1166
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Displays

1167
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Some of these

1168
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Skills

1169
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
The first

1170
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
I went back

1171
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
Back to February 2014

1172
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
Specifically to try and see if I could figure out what Alex Jones

1173
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
Just take on Russia Annex

1174
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Part of Ukraine was

1175
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
So

1176
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:20,063
Esoteric

1177
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Randall bulshit

1178
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
But later in the episode

1179
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
He has an interview with Jerome corsi

1180
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Who is at this point

1181
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Still just a writer for WorldNetDaily

1182
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,863
So he is not even a part of the Infowars full yet but Alex Jones

1183
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
Considers him

1184
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
Missouri

1185
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
Important corrupted

1186
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
Important piece

1187
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
The Patriot movement

1188
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:44,383
The only thing I think you need to know before this clip gets going is that

1189
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,431
2014 February 24th

1190
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
The Winter Olympics in Sochi

1191
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
We're going on

1192
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
In Russia

1193
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
So

1194
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,671
So that's kind of the backdrop of

1195
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
Stuff to draw

1196
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
He's talking about

1197
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,047
Complained that he's going to get to is that

1198
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,359
On fire right now

1199
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,919
As one

1200
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,967
What you're seeing in the Olympics

1201
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
Is it NBC produced

1202
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Michelle

1203
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
The studio show

1204
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Weather

1205
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,215
Suppression of Rights

1206
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Alright

1207
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,831
Display

1208
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,391
Different flags

1209
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,167
James from Rome

1210
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
Written large and made available on your television

1211
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
Free People

1212
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,615
That'll be the demean the competition in the competitors

1213
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,759
You got to realize the political aspect

1214
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
Joseph

1215
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
So hold on

1216
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
You're doing the jack off motion

1217
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
But this is incredible

1218
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,151
Important

1219
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,711
Jerome corsi

1220
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
His

1221
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
Horrible voice

1222
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
As you will

1223
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,927
What he is saying

1224
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
My friend in this clip

1225
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,767
Is that it is the Ukraine

1226
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
Versus Putin

1227
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,887
Very separate interest and the United States

1228
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
To support the people

1229
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,471
Of Ukraine and the Russians

1230
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,519
Who are crying out for help

1231
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
Against

1232
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,359
Putin's totalitarian regime

1233
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
In Russia

1234
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,479
Jerome corsi is 100% the opposite direction

1235
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,831
Yeah absolutely if Alex has any

1236
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,439
What is a disgrace

1237
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,423
Open champion

1238
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,287
Government

1239
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,847
Russian doll

1240
00:58:55,615 --> 00:59:00,735
Well.

1241
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,111
But compared to

1242
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,671
Asthma

1243
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:15,327
Hillary's ribs

1244
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Course

1245
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
Soros

1246
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
Alright

1247
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Been wrong

1248
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:49,375
It is much as they both believed that the EU and the UN

1249
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
Need to be broken up there already

1250
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,519
Geopolitically on

1251
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,359
But you can see at this point I guarantee Alex is not

1252
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
I have that interview with Russian intelligence

1253
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,735
Or at the very least has not been

1254
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,319
Nope the Putin listens to the show yet

1255
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,367
They haven't lied to him and told him that

1256
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,415
Because at this point

1257
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Is it

1258
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Close

1259
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,535
Through that the place that he was at

1260
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:23,935
Ben.

1261
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Kleptocrats

1262
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Right

1263
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,543
He's a hundred percent different than that now

1264
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
In 2015

1265
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,919
We saw it so somewhere between February 2014

1266
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,967
It June 2015

1267
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
Alex Jones

1268
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
Was flipped by Russia

1269
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Intelligence

1270
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
I guarantee

1271
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,671
2018 investigation my friend I think it might be

1272
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,231
There we go

1273
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,791
The all of our investigations are

1274
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
When does Alex Jones completely flip on whatever position he has

1275
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
There's nothing

1276
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
This is crazy

1277
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
This is crazy

1278
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
This is nuts

1279
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
Like

1280
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,687
Eventually gets into like

1281
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,015
Everything bad about Russia's Ally

1282
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,087
Putin didn't actually blow up those Parliament building

1283
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Either great guy

1284
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Qatar Olympic

1285
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
I bet he's going to be huge fan

1286
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
I don't want to just go to all the Olympic

1287
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,047
Text Beatrice

1288
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
To take stuff down

1289
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:34,335
That's ultimately the point of knowledge fight

1290
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,383
Listen to our show

1291
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:43,295
Also I want to give you a quick apology

1292
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
Beginning

1293
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,391
First one was last episode

1294
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
Drinking a little bit we misspoke a tiny bit

1295
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
What am I listening to

1296
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,559
Sent me a message about it and she was totally right

1297
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,607
When we were discussing the Access Hollywood

1298
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
Trump

1299
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
Wework

1300
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Discussing it

1301
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Because we were

1302
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
Being kind of loose with our language

1303
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,311
It made it sound like we were saying it came out in

1304
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,735
Was recorded in 25th we were not clear enough about that and I

1305
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
I meant secondarily

1306
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:19,391
I took out that stuff that we talked about about Daria

1307
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,231
Alex's employee Daria on the last episode cuz I realized

1308
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
About 95%

1309
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
The stuff that I found

1310
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,631
And other stuff that I found since then

1311
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
But I can't

1312
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
A hundred percent

1313
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Stand behind it

1314
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,007
And we need to hold ourselves to a higher stay

1315
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
So

1316
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
That that stuff just doesn't belong and I apologize for

1317
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,919
Jumping on a little bit of

1318
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:45,759
Unverifiable

1319
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,039
That's the trick

1320
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:53,183
That's why it triggered is my friend

1321
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
One thing I'm glad you didn't take that

1322
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,303
Is February 23rd

1323
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Dude

1324
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
So

1325
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
February 23rd

1326
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
He'll Sunday

1327
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,703
We know that Alex likes to

1328
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Let it ride

1329
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
On Sunday oh yeah

1330
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
He starts the show

1331
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Bye

1332
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
He's joined team

1333
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
He's being sarcastic

1334
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,783
And I thought this would be

1335
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,135
Possibly it was going to be a situation where

1336
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,695
Remember a note 20

1337
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
15 there's episode where

1338
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
Pretended to jump the

1339
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:34,655
The shark where he was like all Muslims should be deported. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1340
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
Do something like that where he was

1341
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Entire episode like

1342
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:43,871
I am fully robama guy now if I do an hour-and-a-half of radio like that

1343
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
He did not

1344
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Nevis

1345
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
Gets

1346
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Superfund

1347
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,415
Everything is awesome everything is wonderful everything is good

1348
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:02,559
And ObamaCare

1349
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,599
Except it's not awesome

1350
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
Nice

1351
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
So

1352
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,719
Nicely done now that way to drop the hammer there

1353
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
That's just

1354
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Good fun

1355
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Now in this

1356
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
Next clip

1357
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,911
Alex lays out what he wants to do on this episode

1358
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
And

1359
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
It tickled me to no end

1360
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
And the way it ends up working out

1361
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
The progression of this episode

1362
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
I find

1363
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
Immensely the life

1364
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
And you'll see why

1365
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
At the other end of this

1366
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,879
I just figured out what I want we're not going to take first-time caller or long time caller

1367
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,999
The thumbs-up to do is only people that disagree at least in the first

1368
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:08,351
Our phone call from the next hour

1369
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
I want to hear from apologist

1370
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Wrong

1371
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:18,335
Tell me how I'm a fraud

1372
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,711
Growing worldwide

1373
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,695
Monopolistic

1374
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,191
Mafia organizations

1375
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
We giving you the floor

1376
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,431
Can you call in and nnn

1377
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,479
Attack me for not liking Obama

1378
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,087
Do you want to call

1379
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
Ted Cruz

1380
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:27,967
So

1381
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,759
He starts out he's going

1382
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
You take calls

1383
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
People

1384
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Who are going to say

1385
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,439
He noted already started the clip by saying

1386
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:42,047
I'm going to take calls for people who disagree with me and he's trying to say about Obama

1387
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Yes

1388
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
Then at the end it's like also

1389
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:49,727
Apologize

1390
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:55,103
Here's one problem that Alex Jones has in the reason that he's done multiple episodes like this

1391
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
Can't wait to try and find

1392
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,223
Keith self-selecting

1393
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
From

1394
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
Hughes audio

1395
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,319
No one

1396
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
Cruise

1397
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Intelligent

1398
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
Listen to Alex.

1399
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,439
Like no one who's listening as I

1400
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Call that guy

1401
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
He's very smart

1402
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
Now if you want to go a step further

1403
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
No one

1404
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
Who believes in

1405
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,655
Obama believes in

1406
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Principles

1407
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
Andy smart

1408
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,263
Is listening to Alex and is going to call it

1409
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
He's pretty

1410
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Secure in that

1411
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Gyoza

1412
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,383
So he can just put out these challenges and no like

1413
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
So

1414
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
We'll see if we get any calls

1415
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
But

1416
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
UB Vamps for a while

1417
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,831
Complain

1418
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,647
Why aren't I getting any calls because

1419
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Your audience

1420
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Idiots

1421
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
You are getting calls

1422
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
But you're probably

1423
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,887
In the meantime while he's waiting for a call to come

1424
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
I'm through he gets into a couple areas

1425
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
That are Chi

1426
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Kind of fun

1427
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
The first one

1428
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,775
It is about

1429
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
How

1430
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,103
Democratic

1431
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,919
Represent

1432
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
By the name of Gary Peters

1433
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
Representative out of

1434
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Is Michigan

1435
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Is

1436
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
Get a

1437
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
Ipsa

1438
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
Add taken off

1439
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
Sierra and Alex

1440
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,231
Fascistic encroachment on Free Speech

1441
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,279
Sure so we'll get through it

1442
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
See through

1443
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:30,847
My name is Julie Bowen

1444
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:37,247
I have a 20% chance of surviving this wonderful doctor the Great

1445
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,647
Healthcare portal

1446
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
Obamacare

1447
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,447
Are so high it's unaffordable if I do not get my medication I will die

1448
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:02,335
I believe the process

1449
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
Sodus Point be going

1450
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Commercial music

1451
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
It starts but it's also

1452
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,967
Eating with the

1453
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
Pasa

1454
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,807
Commercial

1455
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,343
Just come back on the other end of the

1456
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Cuz it gets right back to

1457
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,159
So

1458
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,279
It is heartbreaking for me Congressman locators

1459
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:27,679
Vision to vote for ObamaCare jeopardize my health it is time to listen to me it a time to listen

1460
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:32,031
American citizens out there

1461
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:48,671
Why but I'm here

1462
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
I want to tell you this

1463
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,447
Alex Jones doesn't play the rest of the ad right now

1464
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,751
But what he does is

1465
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,775
Accidentally debunked

1466
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
His own narrative

1467
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,639
This is really fascinating to watch

1468
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
For now

1469
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,119
Last year as well

1470
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
Who wants to be

1471
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,599
Is also going after television stations airing ads

1472
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,903
Threatening

1473
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Licenses

1474
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,703
Was canceled under Obamacare

1475
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,495
Peter's decision

1476
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,591
For the law jeopardize my health

1477
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:16,735
Carl Levin

1478
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,671
Organizations investigating

1479
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,191
Obama

1480
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,495
You wouldn't lose your doctor

1481
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,639
People just keep defending this Obamacare

1482
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,623
I know she has no idea whether she will

1483
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
Break even with a new plan

1484
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,255
Trucker Healthcare

1485
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,263
That's the heart of it all

1486
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
You want to know some truth

1487
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:25,599
Yes I do so that was a commercial that I mean the one they played the Julie Boonstra

1488
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,999
For prosperity

1489
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
I wonder why they would want

1490
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Anti-obama

1491
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
They had a little bit of an issue

1492
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:45,055
Under Obamacare

1493
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,639
Affordable Care Act insurance was now unaffordable

1494
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Unfortunately

1495
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,455
People looked into it

1496
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
And saw the plans that were available

1497
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
Terraria

1498
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
And sound

1499
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,367
13

1500
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,463
1200 dollars a year before calpain

1501
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,231
She pays less

1502
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,023
And other out-of-pocket expenses

1503
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
The new plan is 11009

1504
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
152 dollars

1505
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,399
Including co-pays and out-of-pocket

1506
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,727
That's a savings of more than $1,200 a year

1507
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:20,383
So she actually would not right so here

1508
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
The other thing

1509
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,247
Don't tell me that she was allowed to keep her own doctor

1510
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
According

1511
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,071
According to fact-checkers look at the available plans that were available under the Affordable Care Act

1512
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,167
It would have been a slight hassle in order to shift your plans it would have you

1513
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,775
But it's not that big a deal

1514
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,847
Alright the other thing is

1515
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
I've done that

1516
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,735
The other problem with it is the first ad claimed that it was unaffordable

1517
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
Then these fact-checkers looked at it

1518
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,575
It doesn't make sense

1519
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,367
That you would be claiming that it's on a portable

1520
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,927
So they made a new ad

1521
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,975
The new planned

1522
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
Doesn't work for her

1523
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,583
Which is completely subjective no way cheaper

1524
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,679
Of course cuz they knew we just lie to me.

1525
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Weed

1526
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Maybe she didn't

1527
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
Look into it or whatever

1528
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,335
So Gary Peters wanted people to stop airing

1529
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
Not because of some

1530
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
And some like

1531
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,527
Probably broke the Federal Trade Commission

1532
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Rules

1533
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
And I'll just quote

1534
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,879
If an advertisement such as this

1535
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,951
Is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably

1536
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,231
Under the circumstances

1537
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,767
And his material

1538
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
That is important

1539
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,607
Consumer's decision to buy or use a product

1540
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,423
Particularly when applied to ads that make claims

1541
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
News about health or safety

1542
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,263
That is in violation of federal law

1543
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
So you're saying

1544
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,103
That if she were to go auntie

1545
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,383
Claim

1546
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
That be

1547
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Because

1548
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
The price of

1549
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Cheerios

1550
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,783
Just went up she is no longer able

1551
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
How to afford Healthcare

1552
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,367
That would be the same thing

1553
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
As what she

1554
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
She's doing right now

1555
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,719
Stop that lying directly

1556
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,279
Order to influence People's Health

1557
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
That is such a

1558
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
Perfect example of the

1559
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,191
Higher Republican

1560
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Sister

1561
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,311
They even got

1562
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
To record an ad

1563
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,663
That was against her own in

1564
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,247
By believing in the lies that they told her

1565
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,039
The very Republican

1566
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,855
System is against the FTC

1567
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
Commissioner the FC

1568
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
DesiRulez

1569
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Yep

1570
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:47,583
Revoke all Republicans

1571
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:51,679
TV also also by the way I was once married to

1572
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Mark Boone

1573
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,519
Former chair of the Washita County Republican

1574
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Richards

1575
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
That's right

1576
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,407
Mark Richards changed his name Raptors

1577
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Could be

1578
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
Into that area

1579
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,575
There's really no other alternative

1580
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
I think that's the

1581
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,695
I think we figured that out cuz we kind of gone over before Alex

1582
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,743
Complains that all Democrats are racist

1583
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
I imagine he brings up the fact that southern Democrats prior to

1584
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,959
Civil Rights Act where

1585
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,031
Couldn't compete

1586
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,591
In the South started

1587
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,383
As opposed to all of the

1588
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
The southern Democrats

1589
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
Flextron Thurman

1590
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,247
Went over the Republican side because Democrat

1591
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,831
Was becoming much more progress

1592
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,159
I can't even remember what the name

1593
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Better

1594
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
Flags that Strom Thurmond tried to

1595
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,935
Exclusionary pledge

1596
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,007
After-school Scott integrated

1597
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
It's all it's all alone

1598
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015
Which Wich

1599
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Passionately

1600
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,831
Erases forever

1601
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
Here we go

1602
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Let's go

1603
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
Who's finally Alex

1604
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
Man

1605
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
I'll tell you what

1606
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
These

1607
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:32,287
This is this is going to be one of my favorite thing you got to just let this play though

1608
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:03,775
Oh okay you stay that Obama's bad and all that I get some of his military policy

1609
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,151
Carbon dioxide

1610
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
Call too bad but

1611
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,247
Just because it gets cold

1612
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
Mean

1613
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,623
Warming you've seen in Russia

1614
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,975
Record high temperatures for very long time we haven't had freezes

1615
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:28,095
Steer-In

1616
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,359
Before it be frozen most of the time you look at the temperatures they're still going

1617
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
The ice core samples

1618
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:47,295
217

1619
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,111
Carbon dioxide water

1620
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Atmosphere

1621
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,591
Texas shutdown

1622
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,151
Mexico.

1623
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,271
No scrubbers

1624
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Maybe

1625
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
Baby

1626
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,511
Smokestack

1627
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:45,919
Algora carbon

1628
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
I guess it doesn't

1629
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,319
You really are an Obama supporter

1630
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,415
Well yeah I mean we need some

1631
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,951
Better access to health

1632
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,231
Question

1633
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,327
When did you

1634
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
You sound like you

1635
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
No

1636
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,239
Badcock

1637
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
What's wrong with you

1638
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,128
No I haven't had brain surgery yet

1639
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,784
Under a lot of fluoride I've been looking to step up but I don't see the German psychologist I don't see Ray

1640
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
Russian psychologist

1641
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,136
I saw John holder in saying that it would

1642
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Be a nice idea to

1643
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,584
Reduce population but I didn't see him actually said

1644
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
Your call man

1645
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
I just don't know what to say anymore

1646
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
So that's the first call

1647
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,896
Freckles

1648
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
Fun

1649
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,480
What I said

1650
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,040
I love this version of Alex

1651
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,136
Cuz I think that there is another reality we're in Alex

1652
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,416
If you just could

1653
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Break Free

1654
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
From the

1655
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,024
The ideology that he lives in

1656
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,096
And you just started going off on it colors

1657
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
It would be amazing

1658
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,680
Cuz it's colors are dumb

1659
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:18,080
Write to them to be really stupid I just believe whatever he says I pivot The Narrative this way you come along

1660
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
Song with me

1661
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,408
There is just a herd mentality among them

1662
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,760
So when someone calls in a little bit

1663
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:29,600
You're f****** stupid

1664
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,696
Cuz I don't like his callers either

1665
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,680
I don't find that fun I don't like his

1666
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
Assholery being turned loose on real human being I will say this

1667
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:55,456
Fused amongst all of his listeners as opposed to the full force of it funneled on 21

1668
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:59,552
Killman frontierland

1669
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:04,416
The next call is not as fun what

1670
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:09,536
Call his ass homelessness of the next call is not nearly as fun

1671
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Because it's

1672
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,144
You'll see why it's very misogyny

1673
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
Edit it still

1674
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
It's still like

1675
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
Unbelievable on some levels

1676
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
But it is

1677
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
Unarmed man

1678
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,832
Bad guy with an imaginary sword

1679
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,792
Still an infant

1680
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,584
I love them

1681
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,888
So did you get them just under a lot of

1682
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
Fluoride

1683
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,008
Also the idea that scrubbers do all that much

1684
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,568
No it's just like a few guys

1685
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Describe it

1686
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,152
All the cold when it comes out there like

1687
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,016
Reduce

1688
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
To some extent

1689
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,088
No I don't know

1690
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,512
Scrubbing is the process only removes unwanted Subs

1691
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
From the exhaust gases

1692
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
It turns them into a liquid solution

1693
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,400
Solid paint or powder form

1694
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,960
This must be disposed of safely

1695
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,496
If it cannot be reused

1696
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,520
Which generally

1697
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,360
Like Mercury you just end up

1698
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,640
Running the risk of

1699
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,176
Getting a bunch

1700
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,456
Through toxic Mercury the

1701
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,504
You've got to put it somewhere

1702
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,576
It's all water right

1703
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,600
To clean coal

1704
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
Completely way off and he's pretending

1705
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,184
That

1706
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:48,864
Just being able to say scrubbers he's able to stop this idiot who's on the phone

1707
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:55,520
I'm seeing this on the message I don't think so

1708
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
I think that guy was kind

1709
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:02,688
I get the sense that

1710
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,992
Southern accent like that being wrong

1711
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
Is like

1712
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:08,064
But I think he probably could have

1713
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,416
Other things that were reasonable to say a reasonable point

1714
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Bring up Lex

1715
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
Defrost

1716
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
Not coming

1717
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,560
Is is frequently as they used to

1718
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,376
The idea that John P holdren

1719
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:27,776
He's a textbook doesn't say what Alex says it says

1720
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,824
He would have been able to say something

1721
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
Alex made him into a stupid person

1722
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,456
Through the way

1723
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
Bullies rhetoric

1724
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,576
Call Linda

1725
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
Cuz you act like that

1726
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,392
Reply I would never call in

1727
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,416
I could I could

1728
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
Did I bring up things that

1729
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,256
I know you guys I do not think

1730
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:53,376
It's fake it would only we can only confirm it's bake whenever somebody says

1731
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,424
Well first off I really love

1732
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,776
Superman Vitality for anybody who plugs his

1733
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
We're like this

1734
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:06,688
It's even worse cuz I heard to call the other day where the guy was like

1735
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,040
Weird your shirts

1736
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
So now we get to the next call Wonder

1737
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,184
Fabric American.

1738
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
It was next clip

1739
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,144
This is not the fun version of Alex being a dick

1740
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,728
Mayonnaise

1741
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
Okay

1742
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
Thank you

1743
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,176
Listen to get along

1744
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,968
And the reason I wanted him

1745
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,272
To win

1746
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,832
Address

1747
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
Go ahead

1748
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,672
I don't know how that is

1749
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,232
I'm not real political

1750
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,304
I just know what I know for myself

1751
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:00,448
He goes along to get along and that's why he's in power if they didn't want it then power

1752
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
The real oligarchy

1753
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Baywood

1754
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
Not have him in there

1755
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:09,920
You know Ron Paul they shut out because he said it like it was

1756
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,480
Family improved

1757
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,552
I can't find it I'm going to have to withdraw from the race

1758
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:18,368
He was lying about that.

1759
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:24,768
Obama is it could be so much worse

1760
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
Somebody else

1761
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
He is willing to walk the tightrope

1762
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
And try to balance what

1763
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,192
With the people can

1764
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,008
Riverwest and and what the oligarchy

1765
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
What they now call the

1766
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,616
Viola Garden

1767
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,296
Oh my God

1768
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,136
So he's not as mean yet

1769
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
But he does

1770
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,720
Suggest that she has Stockholm Syndrome

1771
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Really funny

1772
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,792
Considering how much he does for Trump

1773
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
Wytheville you like

1774
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,632
He's not perfect

1775
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,192
You're not perfect but he's the only one who can save us

1776
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
Cuz that lady was

1777
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:13,152
I kind of like her take knowing she had a good time for an Infowars caller that was an amazing called

1778
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,456
The idea of it

1779
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:20,064
He is a compromised

1780
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,368
The powers-that-be didn't want to be in power

1781
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,904
He wouldn't be a power I mean

1782
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,696
That's a little paranoid and can

1783
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,000
Conspiracy theories

1784
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:32,608
I think all of the all of the available evidence would support her

1785
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,936
I bought I want her to be president

1786
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:41,056
She shall be but before she does that she's got to come back

1787
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
Cute crush

1788
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,128
Here we go we're coming back from the

1789
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,920
Commercial break we'll see if he goes back to

1790
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
He does

1791
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,992
Have you

1792
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:53,600
Thanks for ruining the mystery does

1793
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,904
Let's see if he goes back to her

1794
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,184
He does and he's

1795
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,976
So abusive

1796
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Gross

1797
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
Okay

1798
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:04,096
Obama

1799
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,712
Tell me about

1800
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,552
Cupcake sweetie pie Obama

1801
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,856
I don't think you I don't

1802
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
I don't think he wants to

1803
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:31,488
Blimey mean I think he just was willing to go along

1804
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:37,376
Those who are really running the show

1805
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:42,496
Obama what's going on

1806
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,056
What's going on right now is

1807
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,480
It's okay that's all that's a good word for them I guess they run the show there there

1808
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,392
They want to leave the people in the direction that they want them to go which means they want them to vote for someone like

1809
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,672
Like Romney

1810
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,464
Or or

1811
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:09,376
More money to Romney

1812
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
Obama

1813
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,152
Because he's a darling cupcake

1814
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:26,784
I don't think so I think I think the internet

1815
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,832
First ran

1816
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,624
You been conned

1817
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,928
Right now in Obama

1818
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:38,560
All I know is that the insurers were in the business of denying claims

1819
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,584
Army

1820
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:46,752
Is Obama wanted to take you out

1821
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:58,272
It's hard to keep them out bushes

1822
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
Obama

1823
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,648
Keeping us up

1824
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:07,744
You know how we are of War

1825
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,840
After these last a year

1826
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,656
He just put his foot down on that issue

1827
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,008
Obamacare

1828
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,544
What is your nickname for Obama

1829
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
My nickname for Obama

1830
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:27,712
Someone who would lead us into war

1831
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,296
Oculus Quest

1832
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,648
No I get it I understand

1833
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,768
Flatbush was so bad I was kind of neutron Obama and McCain

1834
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,472
Obama is one of the few things I was wrong about

1835
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:58,176
Respect

1836
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,456
Alex has been wrong about

1837
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:06,624
Apologize

1838
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,488
I am underestimated the level of evil

1839
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,072
Because he's got this the spiritual Shield of fraud around

1840
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
My dear

1841
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,960
Believe me he's the worst we've ever been hit by

1842
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,776
He's a closer like

1843
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,848
Close things right now

1844
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:34,272
Patriot come from Alex didn't come on Obama

1845
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,184
Look like a gif

1846
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,024
We need to identify the true animated story

1847
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
Problem

1848
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,608
Obama's not the true enemy

1849
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Said yourself

1850
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,424
No he's a luscious cupcake

1851
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:02,688
Is the real question

1852
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,576
I'm not going to say I like cuz I don't go I'm not the end

1853
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:15,744
Eagles cupcake

1854
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,816
That was nice

1855
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:24,448
That was amazing that was amazing

1856
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,264
That dismissive of a woman in front of me

1857
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,320
And I like I think I I think she's the smartest

1858
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:46,976
Infowars caller I've ever heard while he's being abusive to her

1859
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:53,376
Go down that road

1860
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
I mean he's

1861
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,216
That you wouldn't say those things

1862
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Of course not

1863
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,288
That's so little app

1864
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:06,176
If you wouldn't engage with any of her arguments except for the ones that he already had preloaded lines ready to go

1865
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,760
With the ndaa 1007

1866
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:16,416
A massive that it was undone and let's not forget that

1867
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,720
Sabotage peace talks in order to win an election

1868
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:22,816
To go getting

1869
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,096
Thousands upon thousands

1870
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
M5000

1871
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
The people killed

1872
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,168
Who did not need to be killed

1873
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,216
All of the crimes vixen.cim

1874
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,664
We got Nixon on was

1875
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
Nothing

1876
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,736
Compared to the crimes that he committed

1877
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
Capone situation

1878
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,976
I wanted to play that whole clip on it uninterrupted

1879
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,512
Because

1880
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
She handles herself

1881
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,888
With class and aplomb as Alex being just like

1882
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,216
You offer Obama

1883
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,752
He's a horrible person

1884
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:06,080
Piece of s***

1885
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,920
Like you can't engage with any of her points so the only thing he

1886
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,944
You can go to is

1887
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
You want to f***

1888
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,784
Maybe that's why he glommed onto Trump so much

1889
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,576
Is because that's essentially

1890
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,160
Does misogyny this attack

1891
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:24,000
You saw the presidential debates

1892
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,120
You're the one

1893
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,680
You're the you're the pope puppet

1894
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,240
You're the puppet puppet puppet

1895
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,824
If you want if you recalled food to cupcakes

1896
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,616
Bojangles

1897
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,200
Why don't you get like even engaged

1898
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,208
Doesn't even seem to like Obama.

1899
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,256
She's like you know

1900
01:34:56,512 --> 01:35:00,608
I know you're complaining about Obama but the real issue is the oligarchy and I'm like

1901
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,448
F*** yeah lady you're right on it and she didn't call them globalist

1902
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:10,848
No more reasonable and doesn't have the

1903
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:17,248
Catchy is she thinks it is but it's still pretty good I have all the archaic antisemitism of bloodline

1904
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:20,320
Have attached to it so

1905
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,368
Unchecked capitalism is bad

1906
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,904
But you wouldn't dare say

1907
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,256
He does get another caller

1908
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,584
This one's a bit more fun

1909
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,656
Cuz this guy is just dumb and Alex T's office

1910
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,472
We don't have to feel bad about it being

1911
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,520
Piece of s*** because someone's a woman

1912
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,800
Our weekend like

1913
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
Not and not just because

1914
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,896
To being mean to a woman

1915
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Because she

1916
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:51,296
For specific for somebody who is so fake

1917
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,624
Obsessed with being honorable and treating women appropriately

1918
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:01,024
Yeah you're not you're not good at it Sherry had been saying a bunch of really

1919
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:08,704
Aldi's

1920
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,752
Hey you want to f*** Obama don't you

1921
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,800
Come on you want to talk about

1922
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,128
That's all it is you're not a human being with feelings

1923
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,968
You're just thinking with your f******

1924
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Yep

1925
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,528
Yeah and so like this

1926
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
This one is

1927
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
Just a guy who's stupid

1928
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
And Alex gets mad

1929
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,976
Come on down

1930
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,512
Tell me how I'm wrong

1931
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
Alright Alex

1932
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,840
Are you really ready for this

1933
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:42,240
Obamacare you got to look at it very simple

1934
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:46,848
There's 310 million people that don't get a vote in anything

1935
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,664
Those are the people that have a healthy

1936
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
Insurance policy that is provided by the

1937
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,528
Another 26

1938
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,808
40 million people

1939
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,856
You don't get it for dinner

1940
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,464
How many people did he figure actually in the sky

1941
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
But Alex

1942
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:09,120
At this point well the guy is still talking Alex's darting his eyes around the room like

1943
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,824
Through their employees

1944
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:25,248
That's why Alex hasn't but

1945
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,272
Look look look

1946
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,344
What the f*** got going on here

1947
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:35,744
They think those are the people that are between

1948
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,304
350

1949
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,704
310 million people that have health insurance provided by their employer

1950
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,208
People in the country

1951
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
Alright

1952
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
Okay there's 310 million people

1953
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,960
Health insurance

1954
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:21,568
Provided by their employers.

1955
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
Between 1 and

1956
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
3

1957
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,536
Percent that cannot be accounted for

1958
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:45,376
Those are between 3 and 9 million people

1959
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,544
That's what they want to put on that done the

1960
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,848
Affordable Healthcare Act

1961
01:38:55,872 --> 01:39:00,480
I'll be ready to talk about this thing

1962
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,648
You have a chicken that says you're going to

1963
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,952
Gwynedd is 31 Oz

1964
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,536
First of all I love that moment where he's like

1965
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:26,592
These numbers meaning nothing about that insurance company alive

1966
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,896
You have a card with 32 102

1967
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,688
There's you can see in his face like

1968
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,224
You so f****** over but then.

1969
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:38,112
There's like 15 seconds left of this

1970
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
And the way he ended the call is

1971
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,184
Is the f****** funniest

1972
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,352
When you going by the house today at horse care ticket but if everybody understands both

1973
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,680
Chick-fil-A

1974
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,472
Going to go down to 141

1975
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,152
41 Salix

1976
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,432
You and I agree

1977
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
Unequivocally

1978
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:10,368
No no f****** strings attached Alex you and I are 100

1979
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,392
Board together

1980
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,720
Horse carriage

1981
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,280
We're scared that if you get injured you get shot

1982
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,328
If you get injured they put you down

1983
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:24,960
So he's not actually a fan of Obamacare

1984
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,008
No

1985
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,032
Math

1986
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,080
Play

1987
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,872
Alex cannot lie

1988
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,664
Roughly 123

1989
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,432
Percent

1990
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
Cannot be accounted

1991
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Now that's

1992
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,576
329 million call that 15 million

1993
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,856
Cut it in half

1994
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,392
At 7.5 million

1995
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:47,744
That makes me laugh so hard

1996
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,768
Until I die

1997
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,560
All Is Lost

1998
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,608
Except for D'Angelo songs

1999
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
And veterans

2000
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
I will die

2001
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
This Alex

2002
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,008
So much like the Alex's

2003
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:05,408
Who's right there he's on the cusp of being like what the f*** have I done

2004
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,200
Do that cuz you presenting

2005
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
Colors are Obama's

2006
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
Supporters

2007
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:13,856
Not his listeners there his listeners most of them don't support Obama

2008
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,928
Sherry who

2009
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,720
Abused for being a woman

2010
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:23,840
She didn't really support Obama either the first guy unclear what he was talking about

2011
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:26,144
Cuz Alex kept turning him into an idiot

2012
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,936
Like it was unclear what his position was Buddy

2013
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,312
This point have been Obama supporters

2014
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,128
But all three have been Alex Jones listener

2015
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,432
Here's our new show

2016
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
Return Alex

2017
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,992
Into a force for

2018
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:44,576
We're good we're in Alex does nothing but take calls

2019
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,368
And your s*** all over his leg

2020
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,976
I would love that if that like cuz I don't necessarily think he deserves

2021
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
Some sort of horrible pun

2022
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:57,376
She's done but I think it was

2023
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
To make him

2024
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,192
Like be a part of the private prison in

2025
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,728
Industry like cuz he should go to Jay

2026
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,544
Will put him in one of these private prison

2027
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,848
You can work for a dollar a day

2028
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,384
Taking phone calls

2029
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,664
Produce dumbass

2030
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:21,952
Yes yeah there has to be restrictions on the MP Leslie call erisa expound on whatever they want

2031

What

2033
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,704
Like he's close to that moment but he never get we spend so long asking if we could we didn't

2034
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Basketball

2035
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,056
Another call from a guy who doesn't

2036
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:41,664
Like Obama and probably just wants to hook him up with a hook

2037
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,480
Okay here's the end of that call

2038
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:58,304
Voicemail

2039
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
Monstrous

2040
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:07,008
Pokemon

2041
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:10,592
And they're threatening blocking release

2042
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
His number

2043
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,456
Aquascape

2044
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,368
He's just straight-up it was staged

2045
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,160
No

2046
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
In the

2047
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:29,792
In the interest of fairness I don't have all the calls

2048
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,328
But he took because

2049
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,608
A couple of them working

2050
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
Completely nonsense

2051
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:37,728
Like one of them as opposed to 310 million

2052
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:44,640
That one wasn't completely nonsensical one of them a cutout

2053
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:48,480
3 is 1 is a guy calling about how socialized medicine work

2054
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,320
He's like Canada's Great what about these Nordic countries

2055
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
They don't

2056
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,648
Seem to be doing all right and they don't have any

2057
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,184
Total difference Vermont

2058
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,720
Moral

2059
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,120
That's probably what you're saying about you

2060
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:10,752
Nicole is too short nose wasn't good argument

2061
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,776
Duck

2062
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,800
So

2063
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:17,152
Just two other people don't really like Obama at all and they just wanted

2064
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,224
Talk to him

2065
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
So

2066
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
One more call to listen

2067
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Alex

2068
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
This guy disagrees with him

2069
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,536
Disagrees about that

2070
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
What about something else

2071
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,984
Call Gisela spank you

2072
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,288
I disagree with you in several ways

2073
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,920
Before I get to one of those I noticed that you challenge Piers Morgan to a bare-knuckle

2074
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,968
Can you alter challenge

2075
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,248
Two cops

2076
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,552
That took killed Kelly,

2077
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:01,184
Michaels in Las Vegas

2078
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,256
Thank you I'll take you I'll take that challenge

2079
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,376
No I'm not one of those people but I'll Stand in for them

2080
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,984
Promotion or make any money for charity

2081
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:20,384
So now much like when that guy said there's 310 people at ten million people in America

2082
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
Insurance

2083
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,456
Alex is looking around the room like

2084
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
Is going on

2085
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,344
Geico it I said I wanted to fight those

2086
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,392
3

2087
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,672
It's for prep

2088
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:46,240
And I love Tim Alex Jones

2089
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
We're both

2090
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:51,104
Cowards and backed out

2091
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,456
She should have done everybody would have loved

2092
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
Both of them

2093
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
Get their asses.

2094
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,296
This color is

2095
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,320
I like this

2096
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,856
Spirit of it just been like

2097
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
Pittsburgh

2098
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,768
Alex's confusion is Meredith

2099
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:20,288
I'll do it no no no I bet that's okay if you don't if you don't want to fight me that's okay but I can't Rihanna

2100
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:24,128
First of all

2101
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,688
You talk about Jesus and you say that you're a Christian

2102
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:31,296
Jesus dictated the solution to the problem that we're in in the Book of Revelation

2103
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
3

2104
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,232
In Revelation 13

2105
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,792
Elvis very clearly that the Pepsi

2106
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,072
Is the first be

2107
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,752
260 year reign

2108
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,360
Revelation 13 says that the second beast

2109
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,664
Have all the power of the first B

2110
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,784
Obamacare

2111
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,576
So want to be clear

2112
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:11,232
That's the beginning of the show

2113
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,912
So anyway

2114
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,960
He's like let's get Adam revelation

2115
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,776
And you lied you didn't call in

2116
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,336
Obamacare you want to beat my brains out

2117
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,152
Let's just be honest about it

2118
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:32,736
Across-the-board that's what I am

2119
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,880
Okay so if you believe

2120
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:43,232
No I don't

2121
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:48,608
The solution the solution is in Revelation 13 we're not supposed to use a name

2122
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:51,168
Or number and writing it sell

2123
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,448
Yeah

2124
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,776
Paying taxes

2125
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:02,432
Are you going to take taxes from your employer

2126
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,744
Don't go pay income tax

2127
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,352
I don't give people advice that I wouldn't do myself

2128
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,752
Following Jesus I'm saying follow Jesus

2129
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:35,200
If the government will put you in jail for not worshipping the government

2130
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,016
That's exactly what they want

2131
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:45,184
Crazy

2132
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,488
Is

2133
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:51,072
His logic is much better than Alex is good

2134
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:55,936
Jesus does you will be persecuted for following me

2135
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,216
That's orders

2136
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,752
And Alex all the

2137
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,032
Mom says you'll know it

2138
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:04,896
Tree by its fruit quotes that all the greatest

2139
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,920
Applications why he's

2140
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,688
Supports Trump

2141
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,504
And so the idea

2142
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,320
I would never tell my listeners to not pay taxes

2143
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:15,392
You have many times had the son of a guy who said

2144
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,672
Don't pay tax

2145
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:19,488
Talked about how

2146
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,024
Are you referring to

2147
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,072
Peter Schiff his son was on the show all the time

2148
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:29,728
He's like a political prisoner he was murdered by the state if you believe

2149
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
You have to believe

2150
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:35,616
It's great and the idea that you don't tell your audience to do things

2151
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,896
You don't do yourself

2152
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Horseshit

2153
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Horseshit

2154
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
Yeah Alec

2155
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
You don't bite

2156
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,112
Before we get to it

2157
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,648
We forgot to play the out of

2158
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,048
Now is a great time

2159
01:49:54,304 --> 01:50:00,192
Is Alex most accurate prediction today that is great

2160
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:04,288
So this is the last clip that we have

2161
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Disaster Alex

2162
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,616
Is done talking

2163
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:10,432
To these really frustrating callers

2164
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
Play the Sesame

2165
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,016
A little

2166
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,024
Obama supported

2167
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
Poor guy

2168
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,032
He just misrepresented

2169
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,568
The colors we just left

2170
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,896
The guy didn't say use a secret Vatican operator

2171
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:43,456
No. I didn't say you wanted to beat him up

2172
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:47,808
Are you looking to fight

2173
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,880
And none of them really said that Obama would save us

2174
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:56,256
BrightStar of the

2175
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
The evening

2176
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
Yes

2177
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:03,424
Actually that guy talking about the religious stuff

2178
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,984
He probably was pretty smart but he's not

2179
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:09,312
I think it's probably high functioning brain power there but he

2180
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,408
I think there is a

2181
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,736
Okay because he is using decent logic music

2182
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,040
Pieces of Alex's mythology

2183
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,832
Religion is he understands

2184
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,440
Necessarily stupid as much as it is misguided

2185
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,512
Here's my ears my

2186
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,280
Deposit

2187
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
To you

2188
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,144
Imagine our imagine our heroic woman

2189
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
Staying to Alice

2190
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,704
Let me talk

2191
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,032
Now whatever crazy dude said it

2192
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:40,800
Alex

2193
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
Shut up

2194
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,896
Alex had a good 5 Seconds

2195
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,432
They just kind of shut down

2196
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:48,480
If she had done that would he have done

2197
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,528
The same thing

2198
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:56,672
The studio

2199
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
Super male vitality

2200
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,000
You know some sort of thing where it's like

2201
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,864
You know I just

2202
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:09,728
Why women like massage

2203
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,264
Everyone wants

2204
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,056
Here the daddy shark

2205
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
Clip in the chat room

2206
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,688
Well there's that

2207
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
I'm not

2208
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:26,368
For a second I'll find it

2209
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,136
Let's get it

2210
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:27,904

So you can have it for yourself

2218
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,240
I shouldn't do that should sell that

2219
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
Are you shiting me

2220
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,152
I don't know look

2221
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:52,480
I don't have the wherewithal or The Willpower to be like

2222
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,016
I'm going to hold this hostage

2223
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:56,832
Also I don't think we can sell it

2224
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,600
Copyright issue

2225
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,416
Respect map agreements

2226
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,768

This year

2232
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,576
Thinking about it down like

2233
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,880
120 episodes of the show

2234
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,416
We've recorded

2235
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,512
250 3:00

2236
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,048
Content probably

2237
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
I'm at reflect we've written

2238
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,144
Thousands upon thousands upon thousands

2239
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,912
The words

2240
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,936
And that reflects light

2241
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:46,496
Even just a 300 hours of recording

2242
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,776
WhatsApp

2243
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,360
600 hours of editing

2244
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,896
Research

2245
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,920
No sorts of things

2246
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:56,736
Consider that adds together to be about 9

2247
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
2:00

2248
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,064
Of work over the course of the year

2249
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
40 hours a week

2250
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:06,208
Is that for every 4 hours a week

2251
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,256
I don't know how to do

2252
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,024
50

2253
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,560
Descenders 50 weeks in a year

2254
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,864
900 / 50

2255
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
What's 40

2256
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,984

2257
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,456
Can you work full time goddamnit

01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,736

01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,784
How much we jumped in

2260
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,808
Yeah

2261
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,344
Delved

2262
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,624
Through these

2263
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,904
Sickening Waters

2264
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,208
No matter how much

2265
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,512
There's there's always going to be the part of us

2266
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:41,280
Dislike

2267
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:49,216
The fact that so many people

2268
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:49,984
To us talk

2269
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:53,824
About Alex Jones for 3:00 in the last

2270
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,616
Here it's crazy

2271
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:58,688
It's me and I really appreciate it we're pretending

2272
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,456
Episode of the year

2273
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Can go up

2274
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,392
So now now there's a certain part of it that's like

2275
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,440
If we ever recorded law

2276
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,464
Usher

2277
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:13,792
Address for route

2278
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:24,800
Before this chat room number goddamnit

2279
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,080
Thank you very much

2280
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,920
Everybody who supports the show donate

2281
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,456
Huge difference

2282
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:34,528
I never would have thought that anyone would give a

2283
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,808
Looks like about this show

2284
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,880
For nobody and granted we're not doing it

2285
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:42,976
But we're still way more than I expected

2286
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:46,048
Yeah now thank you so much

2287
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:48,352
We love you all so very much

2288
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:58,848
I'm also just a fair warning next year we will be retiring the Sasha Banks

2289
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,896
A song as the intro music

2290
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,944
Look to the show for the livestream

2291
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:06,016
New song will be debuting

2292
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,856
Just a shout out to the legit boss

2293
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,416
Big Ups thanks for taking us

2294
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,952
Along on this ride

2295
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,024
You know 2018.

2296
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
What's the new

2297
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:21,632
Also burn down rich people's homes

2298
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656
You sure

2299
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
Huh

2300
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,472
Probably get rid of this

2301
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,240
Jon rappoport

2302
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:31,360
Either that or we got to re-up on hating him

2303
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,688
We haven't listened to John Wright

2304
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:43,136
I was talking about me in the listeners goddamn I listen to them it's just still boring

2305
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:44,928
I don't know what left

2306
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,256
Reflect on that maybe will choose a new Infowars personality

2307
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,024
To really hate

2308
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,328
In the Jon rappoport maybe we'll go to

2309
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:53,120
Or something like that

2310
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,168
True it's difficult

2311
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,752
Turn on Hayden's room corsi listening to his voicemail

2312
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,520
Makes me want to kill him

2313
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,568
Politically

2314
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,384
We will look into Jerome corsi a little bit closer

2315
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:08,480
And every shows himself

2316
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:12,832
Certainly but for now

2317
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:18,464
I'll just go fight on Facebook we're on iTunes

2318
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,768
Thank you for

2319
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,048
Subscribing end table

2320
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,008
To be able to say

2321
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,288
Jon rappoport

2322
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,568
Goflight

2323
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,336
Type 4

2324
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,104
First of all

2325
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:35,872
Go away

2326
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Suck a lemon

2327
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,432
Expression

2328
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:43,296
While sucking 11

2329
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,832
She has legs

2330
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,416
Only see him sitting down

2331
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:55,072
You at least have a wider angle where they will cancel

2332
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:58,144
See you legs maybe I don't have legs

2333
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
All right Dad

2334
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:05,312
Maybe me and Jon rappoport have that in common it if that is the case you're getting rambling at the end of this episode

2335
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:11,456
Possibly legless people

2336
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,784
Holding

2337
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:20,672
Alex
