00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232

7
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Where's for the owner of Selena little bit about Alex Jones

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,752
A Jordan is that my watching of Survivor

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
I've made it to season 31

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,224
Brawn vs Beauty season

11
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,344
Survivor has a couple of themes of a developed over the course of the years

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
One of them is very

13
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Interesting and compelling

14
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Lingonberries blood vs water

15
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Okay you have

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
People who have

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Play again

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Their loved ones

19
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
Like my wife for their job

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Get the child is

21
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
People are crying all over the place it's a i

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
It's interest

23
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
The compelling twist if you have

24
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Keep changing this show

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
From what it originally was

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
At least that's heard of an interesting sociological

27
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Industrious

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208
Novel ya

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
That isn't just asking

30
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Another theme is beauty verse Braun

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
So just like what's the most

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Important thing

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Three tribes one of them are like beautiful people one or smart people who want to really strong people

34
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
What a weird things

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
To do I find it to be really

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
Poorly done idea to

37
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
Because it's not like

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
The people who are the brain orally through the bronchi but strong.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
Not like they have no mental ability seems like an order for it to truly be fair

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
All things must be boiled down to a single attribute has only string exactly you can only use

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,312
Drink though you can only use beauty or you can only use your brain that type of thing.

42
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,944
Seems to me like that would be how you would do that

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
Girl pretty attractive people

44
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Beauty tribe is like love you were maybe models and stuff

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Everybody says I look

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Look like Obama

47
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,072
Very attractive man

48
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
I'm very smart and I look like

49
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
President Obama

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
My bright spots

51
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
How about you by bright spot.

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
You know

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Over the years I've had

54
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Mani pedi

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,344
Refutes for no reason other than a door suicide

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Has a

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Cured in my life again

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,024
For some reason on Twitter he decided you again

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
He said something stupid and people started

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,960
Stepping up what made it good for me though was it was like revisiting an old neighborhood you know I went back

61
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Avondale the other day

62
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
And you see all the stuff

63
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
It's the same and you see the stuff that

64
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
It's different you like I remember this

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Friedersdorf

And now the name of saline

105
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
One of the fun things that comes along with this

106
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Is it with this land

107
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839

That would be a

117
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
Let's get back to Chicago so you can record the episode

118
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
Text mr. Peabody

119
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
So I've had a bad week

120
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Already

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
And a lot of it has to do with

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,871
People posting that goddamn song of Alex

123
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Another

124
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
Million-and-a-half views as video a lion all over Twitter

125
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
Really it really was bumming me out

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
And it's going to make me need to fully turn off

127
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Notifications and any kind of

128
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Beetle with cuz here's the thing

129
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,679
We talked about that on episode 65

130
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
27

131
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
Team wow we dealt with that in the

132
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Discussed how that is actually

133
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
It's fun and it's funny

134
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,503
Is good it is actually something that plays directly into Alex's actually

135
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
Making content like that and making it really popular

136
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Allows him to better inoculate

137
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
For keep trapped

138
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,607
Yep and make him seem like somebody who's actually aboveboard

139
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
It solidifies a lot of the the

140
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
The negative

141
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Narratives

142
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
The dangerous

143
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
I will do 30 perpetuate

144
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
I wanted to discuss that again

145
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,407
I may be in Greater detail but I realize we've already done it

146
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Highbank that gong 100 time

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,575
But then when I see these tweets come in I get like notifications on my phone cuz I had to turn off the

148
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
David

149
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
It just felt like

150
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Constantly like

151
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Your work doesn't matter

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Yeah it doesn't matter

153
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
And no one cares

154
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
It really bums me out to know that we did that five years ago that's

155
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Too long ago

156
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
It's too long ago it specially for us to have essentially the same tape

157
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,519
Grown at all in five years because

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
The correct steak is already been laid down

159
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
I don't want I don't want to save it there's no room

160
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
A girl them sure there's Nuance we can add to it but

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
It's a little bit of a bummer and that really like soda mess with

162
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
With my my

163
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,415
Emotional state that I like to be generally

164
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
No I understand

165
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
No one's fault and like I like even we talked about

166
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
2017

167
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
I get why people think this is funny I want to share

168
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Did I get it

169
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
He says we need to get to a place where we recognize

170
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
The things that are useful for propagandist in the pan

171
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Is that are not

172
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Land

173
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
I don't know

174
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
What's important

175
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Is that those things

176
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Are great

177
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
But will only be great

178
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
After Alex is no longer a threat to everyone

179
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Yeah man I think I would love to enjoy it five years from now and Alex's if I don't know in space or something

180
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
It was even kind of the point was like a perfect world this would be great

181
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
But

182
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
It doesn't work

183
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
No no

184
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Anyway

185
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Here's the deal

186
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Another thing happened

187
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
And that was the on Friday

188
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Over the weekend

189
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Alex was on

190
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Stream

191
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Some like

192
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Gamer or not gamer but like

193
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,807
I guess I don't know what some people told me these guys are gamergate

194
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Type

195
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,463
I don't know it's like a pop-culture

196
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Recover it

197
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Because I was drunk showed up on this weird

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
And

199
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,191
I really will show up anywhere.

200
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Without without saying anything too much I think he might be showing up a lot of places you might be willing to

201
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
Surprised by the pathetic places you may end up seeing

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
But

203
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Let's just say Rogan is not not the

204
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
The floor

205
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
2

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
I went my watch this

207
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
It was just a depressing

208
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Display is really boring

209
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
These guys

210
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
8 white dudes

211
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
Just sitting around letting Alex Gil things

212
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Mmm being like your jeans

213
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Yeah it was it was a bummer it was a little bit depressed

214
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
It was also strange to see like these people who fancy themselves

215
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Soar like

216
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Lisa presentation

217
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
As far as I can tell like I have no idea I don't know

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
I'm not watch

219
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
These people's Conte

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,207
Then up there they were doing a pop culture related show

221
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
And at least

222
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Three of them have beards that are unacceptable for the office Place broadcasting for bed

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
Bedrooms like DVD collections behind them

224
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Great and so like

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
Weird for me to see these people who are like

226
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Modern

227
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Pop culture

228
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,663
And then they have their minds blown by like repackage

229
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
John Birch

230
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Society talking points

231
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
From back when bees like Alex's

232
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Heroes were fighting against the Civil Rights

233
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
It's so weird to me to see if you like them

234
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
This is fresh

235
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
They are

236
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
It's fresh

237
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
Whenever you're not in the middle of seeing the con

238
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Deserve that bulge

239
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
You know perhaps like I feel like

240
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
The United States has gone through a constant

241
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Ebb and flow of like

242
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
Okay The far-right Kills everybody and then it flows back as everybody's like I know we can't allow that to go on for

243
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
A couple years everything goes fine everybody forgets

244
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
That's that it's your f***

245
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
And far-right friends are going

246
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Kill Everybody

247
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
If they do it again and then we go another two

248
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
20 years inside

249
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
We can't let this happen and then you know a new generation

250
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
S******* show up and we'll see what happens this time

251
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
Anyway I watch this stream

252
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Didn't think it was interesting I didn't

253
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
I think it really brought up

254
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
How many points that I felt compelled to like really cover

255
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Andrea Lee

256
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Kind of just

257
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Bumping out cuz here I am

258
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Trying to go down these roads

259
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
I would like

260
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895

263
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Wasn't

264
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
And then all these people just

265
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Bombarding me with like 12

266
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Rivera meme

267
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
He was almost nothing

268
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,095
This is my Victor Von Doom backstory 8 people on that stream

269
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,215

Coach Steve dozen

271
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,151
Usually have them all on video at the same time

272
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
I just

273
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Gross

274
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
And so anyway I decided

275
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Episode

276
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
I don't want to punish the world

277
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
About a dare

278
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
Make Alex go viral for this stupid

279
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,471
Bulshit again so I am turning heel

280
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Oh God no

281
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
Hello and welcome to the Jim Bakker Show

282
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
I knew this was coming

283
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
Beautiful Ozark Mountains is the author

284
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Courts of Heaven. Pastor Robert Henderson

285
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Pastor Robert Hadden

286
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,631
Anderson it's been a long time

287
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
We should've left you without

288
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Can food

289
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Step 2

290
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Here's the thing

291
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
Jim Bakker had a stroke

292
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
A while back

293
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,223
And there's been a long beard time where I've been like I don't want to talk about his show

294
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Cuz

295
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
I don't feel good about it

296
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
Stroked out old weirdo propagandist monster

297
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Some of his stuff

298
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
And in this episode that I was watching maybe kind of realize

299
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
I don't think it's the stroke I think users old and I don't feel as bad but at the same time

300
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Little bit restrained

301
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Sure

302
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
I have no interest in making fun of

303
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
The points where like

304
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
You know just aging maybe coming in

305
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:13,759
Into a fact get something or whatever like

306
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
But at the same time

307
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
This episode

308
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
Was amazing this Robert Henderson guy is the one who must be spoken about

309
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,791
Pretty hard we're going to find out if you heard about this guy

310
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Pastor Robert

311
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Some self in a

312
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Apostle

313
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,215
That's not good claimed that

314
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
He claimed responsibility

315
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Possibility

316
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

317
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Okay

318
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Okay okay

319
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Alright

320
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Interesting

321
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,039
Here's what he said

322
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
We were in the meeting on Monday night in DC and I told them I said look

323
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
We need to go to the courts of heaven right now while we're on site in DC and we need to shut the mouth of a lion

324
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Judicially

325
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,983
We need to ask for a judgement against the lion that is actually been devouring and it tends to devour from the Supreme Court

326
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
We need to get a judgment against this lion that Paul said God shut the mouths of

327
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
So I let us into that place

328
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Well guess what

329
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed away

330
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
President Trump. Blache new Supreme Court

331
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
That's no accident

332
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Okay

333
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Alright well I mean

334
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
I guess arrest

335
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
Tim

336
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
He's claimed through prayer you put a hit on

337
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
A confession

338
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
And I think he should be arrested

339
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
If you believe that he murdered Ruth Bader Ginsburg he should be punished accordingly

340
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,615
He later walk that back a little bit was like look I'm just saying I was praying

341
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,455
I heard

342
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
This like a nerd

343
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
I'll just put on my car.

344
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
The episode is titled

345
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Mike's

346
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Speaking in tongues

347
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
All right right

348
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Tower in my wheelhouse pretty excited about like

349
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
What's Jim Bakker going to talk to the

350
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
This guy about

351
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Speaking in tongue

352
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,959
It does not end up being mostly about that

353
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
The content of this episode is way more interesting

354
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Something that

355
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Albino

356
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Every episode of Jim Bakker

357
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
The show starts

358
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Took a little bit of light-hearted

359
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Discussion

360
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
With the family

361
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
His co-host

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Tammy Sue Bakker sings

363
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
The theme song and blood brings people in

364
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,903
The radio.

365
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
They're in their own compound

366
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,279
Fake TV show for fake people

367
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
In a fake situation

368
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
For money for no reason

369
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
When I was watching this

370
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
I will not

371
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
I will not

372
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Say that I didn't think it's possible this is that tire

373
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,271
It's so over-the-top Robert Henderson who's the guest yeah

374
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
He has to stop himself from laughing

375
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:03,487
What the f*** out know that's not fair he almost break

376
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,423
You can't beat Jimmy Fallon and a f****** cogman at the same time that's how it works

377
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
It's pretty wild

378
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,055
Beginning they talked a little bit about going to family stuff

379
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Happy birthday is coming

380
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Interesting point

381
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
Wow

382
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,415
Wow years old now she told me the other day and I just don't accept it

383
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,999
I don't accept it either Jim

384
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
That's cute that's cute as hell

385
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
I really like that

386
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:47,519
There's also a point where Lori says that her like their anniversary is coming up

387
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
Can you remember which one it is and he's like 20

388
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
23

389
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,527
It's going to be 23 so I have right God

390
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
Still think they're horrible people

391
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
The presentation of like soft

392
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Miss sure

393
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Seems like

394
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
It's caring

395
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Queen Victoria back in her day I'd like this

396
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Goofing around

397
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
I kill people I can't accept that my daughter is 50 years old

398
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
I don't accept

399
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,407
Build those little kids aren't they though aren't your babies always the babies in the ass

400
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
Handlery you're going to be old are you going to be

401
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
You know you're not supposed to ask a lady how old she is

402
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
6

403
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Before retiring one more year

404
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Wish I was turning 50

405
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
C5 so I could get my medicare

406
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
Yep over that year and go straight to 6

407
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
55

408
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,807
I'm so grateful I can't wait so I can take advantage

409
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Program

410
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
I'm philosophically opposed to everything that the Democrats

411
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,607
1960s whenever they did pass Medicare Medicaid that was a pretty good called

412
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
Social Security in the 1940 that was a great idea can't live without that everything about my political ideology leads

413
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Me to do definitely want this to go away but I also would like to skip this here so I can take a shower

414
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,551
Healthcare that I refuse to accept it should be allowed to pay into this but no I want to skip

415
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
Years like experience socialism a I like to vacation in socialism

416
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Better there

417
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
I'm going to

418
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Generally not

419
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Hotspot

420
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
Lunchtime on gyms.

421
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Because I really do think

422
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Henderson guy

423
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Not so much

424
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
I don't I got a lot of theories about him okay

425
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
He's bringing to the table

426
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
He's

427
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Amazing

428
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Okay

429
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
He has this new book about speaking

430
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
In tongues

431
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
But it is Introduction Jim brings up his other books

432
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
The series

433
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
He's called the courts of Heaven

434
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Get the f*** out

435
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
But we're about to introduce our Pastor Robert Henderson

436
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,823
Speakers in America today leave that

437
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Books

438
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Going bananas

439
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Edward yousif

440
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,319
Do people love the

441
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,391
The court of Heaven

442
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Siri this is actual

443
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
Play series

444
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Books on it

445
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
It's just it

446
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
People have found an answer

447
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Two unanswered

448
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Prayer in those books

449
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
Yeah that's that's what that's what's called them

450
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Almost

451
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
Supernatural

452
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
Oh absolutely

453
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
That there's a supernatural

454
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Ocean on those

455
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,759
It's not just letters on a page

456
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
It's like a spinner

457
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Portation

458
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
What is Magic

459
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,488
Are you really going to come out

460
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
The gate with this book

461
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:26,144
Will heal you because the words are literal Matt it hasn't unction

462
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
I was intrigued

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,848
Float away by the gall of someone to be like my book

464
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Is literally mad

465
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Pretty I was pretty

466
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
Taken aback by the

467
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
The open it

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
I want to know more what is

469
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
What it what's going on I mean if you try some of his words

470
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,792
Silver and you get the name the true name of the person that you want to curse then you will of course have power over

471
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
That isn't in the book

472
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Is that more to do with the

473
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,704
The courts of Heaven I don't spoil too much

474
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
Learning about this is going to be amazing

475
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
I'll tell you this

476
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,640
If rbjs in the courts of Heaven he's going to be real pissed

477
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
She didn't make it.

478
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
What are the things that we always find Most Fascinating is

479
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
The preoccupation

480
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Among space weirdos and Alex

481
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
With like

482
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Interstellar contract law

483
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,024
And that's really why this episode of special

484
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,096
Because when he's talking about the courts of Heaven

485
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,216
Literally

486
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
When I go to heaven

487
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
Is a little bit of a light-year the movie Defending Your Life

488
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
It's not just after you die

489
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
It's also while you're alive

490
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,112
You can take advantage of the Heavenly court system

491
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Alright

492
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
Who do I sue

493
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,512
Alright okay so

494
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,632
I take the devil to court I get it I get a Selmon's I got a subpoena

495
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Serves as somebody

496
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:09,056
A court representing the devil or angel

497
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
Atlanta demon shows up in a suit and tied the lawyer for the devil

498
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Leaving

499
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Then you argued your case

500
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
And then what

501
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Do you get rest

502
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
What if you lose

503
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
See these are the questions that I'm glad you have

504
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
And

505
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
Only one man

506
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Can explain

507
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
OK Google I want to do time

508
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
No I got

509
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Excitement

510
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
This is what happens when I turn heel

511
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
He's got a book he's working on

512
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
With the court system

513
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Interesting Dynamics at play

514
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Deli news there's going to be another one

515
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Oh yeah

516
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,024
Coming out with me and my son real quickly it's called importing

517
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
Generational blessings from the court of Heaven

518
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,424
A lot of times we talked about doing all that.

519
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
The Devil's Due

520
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
But there are legal things that are hanging in the spirit world that we can grab hold up and

521
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,432
Generational blessings and party decorations

522
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Show

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
Broke out the gifts of tongues and boys it a good book

524
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:33,792
You can kind of get the idea of why this guy can't keep a secret

525
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
That is

526
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
Hilariously sit there are legal things you can

527
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,568
Can do in the spirit world if you want to avoid the generational death tax

528
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,688
In the spirit Court obviously I don't want to have to pay

529
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
Taxes on the money that I want to leave by the blessing

530
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Absolutely

531
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
You don't you don't want God taking 16

532
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Pics of your blessings

533
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,744
Here's the number one problem I have I swear to you

534
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
If I was a religious person

535
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
That wouldn't

536
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Furiate me

537
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
So much

538
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Just because

539
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
If you are

540
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
Getting me to live through this

541
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
To Heaven you're telling me that when I get to heaven

542
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
It's vision

543
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
You have to have

544
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
The calm down

545
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Because again

546
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
It's not about like when you died

547
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
I understand how that judgment

548
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
In court saying it right

549
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Seems like it's when you died

550
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
That's probably

551
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Only part of it

552
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
It's happening now

553
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
Okay it's like everyday

554
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
Alright everyday to open 24/7 rab5 and you can go to them

555
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
Deal with the devil for all the wrongs we done

556
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
Take him to court for suing that fiddle contest

557
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
For cheating

558
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
That was a Goldendoodle

559
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
So we recently learned that Alex

560
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576

Got over it

564
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
It seems like

565
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Had some troubles on that for

566
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Front to the Holy Spirit

567
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Quickening made

4

570
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144

Physically ill

576
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,480
Oh yeah yeah covid I already told everybody on TV

577
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
Everything

578
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
The meaning he had it bad

579
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,120
Previous episode

580
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,216
Like you realize we're not

581
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Doing that

582
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
We're not saying that

583
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Pretended something else going to have to take

584
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
You to a quart

585
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,736
What is the notice to is that Lori is really coming into her

586
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
I don't know if

587
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
The time since

588
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
That guy you know

589
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
Stroke engine

590
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
Step up I think that she has a lot more personality

591
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Then when I was watching

592
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
The show before

593
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Confidence

594
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:25,056
Nice to be able to like have her own identity I can applaud that a little

595
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,360
There's episode you know the the old boss

596
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
Got to step aside and let the Youngblood takeover otherwise

597
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Just going to go out of business

598
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
I still don't

599
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
G-great ansioso

600
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Insist on referring

601
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Jim is Jim Bakker

602
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Call Babe

603
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Really weird

604
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,024
Dahlia conversation we've had our Fair

605
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Robert Henderson recently spoke

606
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Status conference

607
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
It's called the appendix

608
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
Costco Fire Conference

609
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Just about to go

610
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Spirit

611
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Together to Revival

612
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
AllShare the Revival

613
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Now there's a reason

614
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
But they had him come

615
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Open

616
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
The entire concert

617
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Oh yeah yeah

618
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Treveri

619
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
There's a lot of young Revival

620
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
That are rising up across

621
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Destination

622
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,280
And I mean Revival services are breaking out in tremendous ways

623
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
But the whole issue

624
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Was to

625
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
What's 2

626
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Grab hold of Pentecostal fire so the week

627
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
Revival come

628
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
To the nation of America

629
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,920
What I did my part what I did was they wanted me to open the conference

630
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
Imprison us in

631
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
That we might

632
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Step into the courts of Heaven

633
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Everything

634
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Done in that conference could

635
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
Speak in the courts of Heaven

636
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
And that God on the basis of that testimony

637
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
Could render a judgment that would let his glory come to the yard

638
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Because it needed things to be on the record

639
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
In the court of Heaven

640
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Answer like you need you need an official

641
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Like

642
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,080
A barrister a lawyer

643
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,920
We've moved when I was growing up there was that there's that paradox

644
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
School question of like

645
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,064
Good God who can do everything create a mountain that he can't move

646
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Message just like

647
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Look

648
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
If you don't open the court

649
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
God can't hear you

650
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Or he can choose to hear you or not

651
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
God has a lot of weird rules how so happen to be ones that maybe I created

652
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:31,776
This thought is coming too late cuz we're in the middle of recording this episode but I really should have called the opening arguments

653
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Guys

654
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,664
Deals in the car

655
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,528
Give me the standing of the Heavenly law

656
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
In the courts of Heaven

657
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
What's the statute of limitation

658
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
If it's a dinner if it's Eternal how long do I go

659
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
Jim wants a little bit of an explainer

660
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
We all do

661
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
This

662
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
I'm going to do a lot more look

663
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
This guy because he seems like a tip of an iceberg

664
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
On the Sanders.

665
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,384

Run again

671
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
We never get tired of hearing

672
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
The courts of Heaven that

673
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
We're talking about

674
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512

Not

683
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Not a joke

684
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Honest-to-god pitch

685
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Nightcore.

I just got a testimony this morning

709
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
I'm someone in England

710
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Who was in a coma or in a whatever state they were in

711
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
With covid

712
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,872
And while they was covid they were in the court of Heaven they knew nothing about the quarterback

713
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,712
Against

714
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,808
And they began while they were in the court of Heaven while they're in this state

Answer that

00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Case they got completely well

717
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
When they got back and started sharing their testimony

718
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,560
Someone said have you heard of Robert Henderson in the teaching on the port of Heaven they said no

719
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328

Take care of the Courts

730
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
No implication or insinuation that you need a lawyer

731
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
You can represent yourself

732
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
Thought I would assume that God would provide a lawyer for you on the bench

733
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
God's got the judge

734
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
I mean but yeah but

735
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280

00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
I regret that you lost your s*** so much of that last clip because that wasn't the one that I thought was

740
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Going to be

741
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
It's going to get bad

742
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
It's going to get it was where I was like

743
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Definite Mike down for this

744
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
I like a clip that turns into a club because I have to put the bike that sometimes our unexpected a little bit

745
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
But this one holyshit

746
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
Plays a trailer

747
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496

748
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,056

749
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
I have

750
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
Almost no ability to believe is a serious

751
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,224
This is a trailer from his show so let's roll that and then we'll talk

752
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Divine restraining order restraining order

753
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
In behalf of us

754
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
In our family

755
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
You didn't notice what this Widow said

756
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
Estes4me

757
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
So she was saying I want the

758
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,576
I don't want to just be free from judgement

759
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,904
I want the devil judge and I want

760
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,768
What he stole from me God did not only vindicate

761
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,056
Exactly like a lawyer commercial

762
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
Exactly what that sounded like sounded like some late-night have you been injured

763
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Are you injured

764
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:38,624
Have you been injured by the devil you're not the only one doing the class action lawsuit

765
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
I've got Jesus Ophelia Loma

766
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,584
I cannot believe

767
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,824
You can get putative damages what is that count for

768
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
What is that code for

769
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
I get the joke

770
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,016
Before but I was Jeff who gives a s***

771
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
Let's get those old son's back

772
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,648
Look the court can't do anything about that

773
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,536
Those new kids are good enough

774
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
I like the idea that there's punitive

775
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,912
Images and like that that is what happened

776
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,800
The story of Jobe what I learned from Jobe was not

777
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Don't question

778
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,688
God he'll just f*** with you for no reason who are you to say s***

779
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
You got to take the devil the devil Courtright

780
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Because that's the only place you can get Jeff

781
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Sky

782
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
This is this is so weird

783
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,232
I think it probably goes without saying but it one point in this

784
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:52,352
He does that he's not a big research guy

785
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Feeling it out

786
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,192
I just kind of like a / 5

787
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Like I've watched

788
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Really

789
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Ridiculous stuff

790
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
On Jim Bakker

791
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
Like I've seen some swings for the fences

792
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:09,760
Booking Mike lindell's been on Hellyeah

793
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
The Christian world

794
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Outrage

795
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
Just we've talked about

796
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,440
What's her name Paula white-cain

797
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
Batshit even even

798
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,048
Like a lot of these Prosperity Gospel people like

799
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Bay

800
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Healing

801
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Comparison

802
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
To the guy who's pitching

803
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Heaven Court

804
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Hey just

805
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm Blown Away

806
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
I'm Blown Away

807
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm bi mean

808
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
That's that's just

809
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
People are so in

810
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Interested to learn about heaven Court

811
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Of course they are

812
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,760
It's not mentioned anywhere in the Bible that is not really

813
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Disgust or anything and honestly

814
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
That sounds crazy

815
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,696
Well I should tell you that in this next clip Henderson does give

816
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
A scriptural basis

817
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:56,096
Okay for his believe his beliefs and then also like he explained

818
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
How it works

819
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,680
And if you don't quite pick up on what he saying Alex

820
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
Daniel 7:10

821
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
But anybody that's

822
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
Kind of unfamiliar

823
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Best

824
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
What are the best

825
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Maybe the best scripture on the cord

826
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Where is Santa

827
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
That he seen

828
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
Daniel seen all of this activity in the Unseen realm and then it says

829
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
And of course

830
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Was seated and the books roll

831
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,440
So what that means is that the books that means

832
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
That's stupid that's the place

833
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
The cases come out of Princeton

834
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,120
Images used in the ministry has a book in heaven

835
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Okay

836
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
It's written because you didn't just dream this ministry up

837
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,360
Now I'm just Ministry originated in heaven Before Time began

838
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,456
16 that before time again

839
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
He was written in heaven Before Time Again

840
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
So what happens is that God

841
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:53,952
God comes and he began to reveal what this ministry is supposed to be what it's supposed to do

842
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,792
You take that prophetic weariness and you presented in the court

843
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
And you say God

844
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Let

845
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,680
What you said about this ministry come to pass and then

846
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Anything that there's

847
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
To touch that

848
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,848
Just like this Onslaught you went through to touch that

849
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
You bring that he's a god

850
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
This is not about me this is about your purpose

851
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah

852
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Come to pass

853
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,464
Everything is supposed to happen with Cumberbatch and anything that there's the

854
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Asking

855
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
From the courts of Heaven

856
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,264
And you're asking for a legal judgment

857
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
The purposes of God

858
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,504
Excuse me you took off your glasses using a counselor

859
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
I would just like to

860
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
2 point outside

861
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Court

862
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
Has multiple definition

863
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
Oh yeah it does and

864
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
So one quart

865
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,024
Could simply be the king's court

866
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Or

867
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Another word for written

868
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
A group of people

869
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:10,496
Surround the king and provide the assistant and it even Beyond

870
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Two biblical translation

871
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,336
And there's a lot of issues where words mean

872
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
Multiple things in life

873
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,944
The Aramaic that it comes from in the Book of Daniel

874
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
Is a little bit questionable could just mean judgement

875
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
Surprising that the King James version would include the word Court

876
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
Considering the

877
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Consensus around Wichita

878
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
It's dubious at best

879
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
He was more of a study guy

880
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Imagine

881
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
You could have got to the bottom of this

882
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
Get out

883
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Helpful

884
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Here's how it works

885
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
Open heaven.

886
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Predetermined

887
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Everything that's going to have

888
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
No you can't include that part

889
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Because if you include the part where it's predetermined

890
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Then the rest of it

891
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Nothing everything is predestined

892
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Send in these books

893
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Right so everything that you're going to do that is

894
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Is Meaningful to heaven

895
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Congrats in these books

896
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Sing his

897
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
TV station

898
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
And weird compound

899
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
The beginning of time

900
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Write board

901
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Okay

902
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Sorry

903
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
I guess who go to prison was also part

904
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
8D

905
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
Send my book right into

906
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Jim Bakker gets a silly idea

907
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
About what he wants to do like

908
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,832
Add another layer to the compound or whatever

909
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Put in

910
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
An ice cream parlor

911
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Forgot permission

912
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,024
We get these ideas is experienced

913
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Does prophecy

914
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
We get these prophetic visions

915
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,936
Of what he's going to do with his compound

916
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Predestined in the book

917
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
Friends actually getting is a glimpse

918
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Set that book

919
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:52,640
So if anything stands in the way of him putting up that ice cream shop at Morningside right

920
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Then you got to take it to court

921
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,247
I got to take that trip to court and he's got to get it

922
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Right

923
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,343
Now now and I'm going to throw this out here for you

924
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,719
I'm just going to toss this one why it out I'm just going to break this whole case wide open

925
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
Watch yourself counselor if it's predetermined

926
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Okay

927
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
Then it doesn't matter if someone tries to get in the way

928
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
That is also pretty tutor

929
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,775
All of this is predetermined if it's so predetermined

930
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Not

931
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Happened

932
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,639
Otherwise you're saying that your God has no Act

933
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
Willpower

934
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
Yeah yeah there's that there's a lot of loose threads

935
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
I wonder if you can get a sidebar

936
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
In the quarters Hadley

937
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
Cell

938
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
To the side and be like you realize this guy is

939
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,191
So let's say that something is like you've planned that you've decided is prosthetics

940
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Something comes up against

941
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,799
Set right you've got to go take it to Heaven Court

942
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
It doesn't matter

943
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
If it's not a prophecy

944
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,711
You're getting hung up on that

945
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783
Stop that you have to let it go because if you take these things

946
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,135
Escort that are getting in the way and get damages

947
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,975
Once you get a judgement from the Lord then you ask for rest

948
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Duration just like Joe

949
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559

00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,495
Punitive damages

952
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
For your pain and suffering

953
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
True yes

954
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591

958
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,879
Scab

Like it

960
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Though

961
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
So bizarre

962
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
And I don't know if

963
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
Jim Bakker really does have

964
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
A large enough audience

965
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
This is

966
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
Dangerous as a belief

967
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Call boy

968
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
At least before the internet

969
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
You used to have

970
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
To sell snake oil

971
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
There had to be some oil

972
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,527
This is literally a guy just going like hey man

973
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063

Evil people to court

976
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Then you get

977
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Snake oil

978
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:18,559

Walkways around

Things that he wanted here

992
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279

00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
The new Studios

994
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,215

Right now business

1017
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
A piece of my puzzle that's right

1018
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,215
Dream is a prophetic awareness of what God

1019
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
So you take that

1020
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
That word into the court

1021
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
And you say anything that would dare stand on the way of them

1022
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
Stewart weight loss

00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087

1026
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
We could do what was your sister

1027
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,535
Yeah that's what this dream of a parking lot God is a prosthetic limb

1028
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
What's in that

1029
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
At book that's in

1030
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
In the courts of Heaven

1031
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,191
So anything that would stand in the way of Jim making this parking lot

1032
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
You know

1033
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
Junction from the court

1034
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,615
Heavenly board deal with zoning

1035
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Look what if somebody is like hey

1036
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
This could be an indigenous burial ground

1037
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,087
You can't just let them get away with looking for the crimes of the past

1038
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
You got to go to court

1039
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279
In with heaven and then he'll give you twice as many people as were in the graves

1040
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
That works

1041
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Possibly I think so

1042
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,655
Is there a small claims Heaven Court

1043
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751

I think we want to park

1047
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:17,759
It has to be a prophecy even just be like hey I think people could appreciate a parking lot

1048
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
We don't have enough parking

1049
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,439
Ozarks there is winter issues with parking

1050
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,023
Inside parking would be advantageous

1051
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Record Fender this

1052
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887

My time for this

1058
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
BisMan

00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,319
I don't know what kind of alike

1060
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,951
Deal this Henderson character has good like having his show on the network

1061
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
Jim selling his books and what have you

1062
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,839
But if you ever needed to like claim that he made his money

1063
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
Right here is where he burns his money

1064
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
The mayor said one more thing about you

1065
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
Forgivers your partners

1066
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007

They become a part of your break

1069
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
What I mean by that

1070
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Is there is a Kinect

1071
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
Shin made in the spirit

1072
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,807
It allows them to claim for themselves

1073
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,159
The same blessing that comes up on Jim Bakker in PTL Network all these kind of things

1074
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,463
Because finances make

1075
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Connections

1076
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
In the spirit world

Little little boy figure

You give a little piece

1090
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
It's not trickle down economics

1091
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,823
It's not just that

1092
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,711
It's a legal right that you have on these blessings

1093
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
What if

1094
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
Your maker is doing

1095
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
By giving him money

1096
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Would actually be a detriment

1097
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,231
Pliable

1098
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,303

00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,727
You tell Nate to Jim Bakker you're running a deficit

1102

00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
You're throwing money

1104
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Literally

1105
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Spiritual

1106
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
Soaked

1107
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,943
But it turns out as you give a thousand dollars

1108
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
Haha

1109
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783

Dope for a thousand dollars you could have like a couple of other things like a book in a CD sure but

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,383
Eduardo Velez like Laurie

1125
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,943
It's no one else putting the blanket over gym

1126
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,575
Lego clones

1127
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,879
Christmas carols

1128
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
The very stage photo

1129
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Looks awesome

1130
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,023
I am just

1131
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
You know it's almost like

1132
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
It's almost

1133
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
It's so brazen

1134
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
I'm blue you know you're more likely to be like

1135
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,239
There's no way they could get away with that if

1136
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
If it's not true

1137
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:27,103
That's insane

1138
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
Equals

1139
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Have it like that's banana

1140
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
Imagine

1141
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
The dark moments of

1142
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,783
Curiosity or doubt

1143
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,063
Are really difficult

1144
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
If you if you

1145
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
If you don't

1146
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,927
Imagine that they know they're f****** around

1147
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Let me know that this is

1148
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
Is a scam

1149
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
Sincere

1150
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:49,119
I just don't understand how you would ever get out of the moment of Crisis where you're like

1151
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
No way

1152
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
No way

1153
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
It's so so

1154
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Silly that it

1155
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
Has to be all like that

1156
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
House of Cards is such

1157
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
Watch that anyting

1158
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
Even though

1159
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Slightest

1160
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
With of doubt

1161
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
Would knock the whole thing down immediate

1162
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
So it has to be

1163
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Perfect

1164
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Or nothing

1165
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Anybody any rates

1166
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Thinking person

1167
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Checking out that

1168
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
Trailer for the dudes

1169
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Joe

1170
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
If you're trying to put

1171
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
Trailer for The Sky show you

1172
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Guys this looks

1173
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
Ridiculous

1174
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
This is Better Call Saul

1175
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
Parody of what we're doing

1176
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
We need to

1177
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,127
Let's try and give it a little bit of Gravitas

1178
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
Let's give

1179
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Like an edge to it

1180
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
It's it's

1181
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,527
Awesome show I do I do appreciate that

1182
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
It does seem like

1183
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,135
The Scientology scam

1184
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Took all the lessons

1185
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,975
It's from like the early revivalist preachers that

1186
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,047
You know that the marjos in the like that whole thing

1187
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
And then they were like

1188
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
What if we made it even more Brazen and just

1189
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
Just ask for money and blackmail

1190
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
Tell people

1191
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,311
Jim Baker's like well I mean scientology's got a great scam going but what if we just go even

1192
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Crazier

1193
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
Don't even bother blackmailing people

1194
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,479
Jesus freak people out and then

1195
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
You don't need to pay to get these secrets

1196
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
These secrets

1197
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
Are so crazy we can't.

1198
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
Give them to you

1199
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
So

1200
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,863
The baker family for

1201
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,423
You're not wrong I believe

1202
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Maybe even before

1203
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
Lori would like to remind us that

1204
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
JustBats

1205
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Allah people falling away but

1206
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
Also Harvest

1207
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
Time

1208
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,479
You know we have to always remember that this

1209
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,319
It's harvesttime yes there's going to be a great falling away the word says

1210
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
But it's

1211
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:51,231
A harvest I'm with right here right now

1212
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,535
People are getting saved because

1213
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
Covid is making them know they're not immoral

1214
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:01,471
Edgar realizing we're going to die

1215
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,055
We're going to die just causing people

1216
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
To look at their eternity

1217
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Dayton

1218
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
That's depressing

1219
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Stats

1220
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Bananas

1221
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
I shouldn't use that

1222
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
No

1223
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
That really I mean there's

1224
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,807
This is really funny

1225
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
That's it.

1226
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,647
Really sad that is f*****

1227
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
That's the danger though of religion

1228
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
Did you know you can laugh at how stupid all of it is

1229
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,815
But then you get a religion

1230
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
I understand this is a religion

1231
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,471
Everybody anybody who has like I don't know a relation

1232
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
Kinship with a deity or like

1233
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
You know like had some kind of a belief in

1234
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
That is not

1235
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Something that should be

1236
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
You necessarily

1237
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Like outright

1238
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Like wrong or stupid

1239
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
This is stupid

1240
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,135
No this is not what I would say that any kind

1241
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,463
Kind of connection you have with eternity

1242
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
But when you start making up dumb rules

1243
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,607
That's when we start talking about religion that I think

1244
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Exactly like heaven

1245
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Having dislike

1246
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
Prospective tour

1247
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
What's covid

1248
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
You know

1249
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Not for nothing

1250
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Or a spec

1251
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Infidel

1252
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Knock knock

1253
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
For a second

1254
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Courts

1255
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
Can help you with that

1256
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Did you know that

1257
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,183
Wu said there's a way to receive Divine protection

1258
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
From the courts of Heaven

1259
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
What must we do

1260
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
I believe Joe bazooka

1261
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,375
Picture before he went through what he went through

1262
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
It was a hedge

1263
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Around him

1264
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,567
As long as it means a little lie a protective restraining order

1265
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
If you well

1266
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,407
It's not some kind of flower tea thing that the devil can't pain-free

1267
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
It's a legal rendering that says you can't go past that

1268
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
You can't touch him he's mine

1269
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
And

1270
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
That was set in place

1271
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Three things happen

1272
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
No harm could come to joban his house

1273
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Accumulation of wealth

1274
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
And great influence

1275
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,631
Because the enemy had no power to devour that

1276
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
Because he couldn't touch him

1277
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,983
Because he was behind a restraining order of God

1278
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Fossa

1279
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
Daughter that is

1280
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,687
I guess what we need to do to protect yourself from covid is go to heaven

1281
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
Concord

1282
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
So I approve that it's predestined that you're not supposed

1283
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
And then get a restraining order from

1284
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,927
You know I would recommend that Pastor Henry

1285
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,511
Carson read a wonderful play by Scotsman

1286
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Call Jacob

1287
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
Much better explained

1288
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,143
The point of the book of Jobe

1289
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,471
And how to go about interpreta get from an existentialist point of view

1290
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:46,335
I'm sure he's going to put that I will tell you what the point of Jobe was

1291
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
That there is a

1292
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,967
Court system that both God and the devil abide by

1293
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,831
As though there were a higher power it would two of them

1294
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Yes

1295
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,439
Imply that there is haze level of power

1296
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,487
Both God and Satan voucher

1297
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
Right cuz it's a legally binding document

1298
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
It's just

1299
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
I didn't expect this

1300
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
I mean like I just wanted to hear about

1301
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
Speaking in tongues

1302
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
That would have been great

1303
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
Brizard judicial system that exists

1304
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
Today's

1305
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
Robert Hutchins on today

1306
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,271
The first day is mostly getting off track

1307
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Into the courts

1308
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
I feel edified

1309
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
That I've learned about it

1310
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Pixlr

1311
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Something

1312
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Something

1313
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,975
Play I've been like

1314
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
Still learn about the

1315
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Speaking in tongues

1316
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:43,167
I find that to be something that I'd love to see demonstrated

1317
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
This is a great scam

1318
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
One of the best

1319
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
I would have loved

1320
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,031
Spoiler they don't end up

1321
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Doing a split

1322
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
But I thought it might be fun if it's gas

1323
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,943
Started doing well you can't do it on command otherwise people will know you're fake

1324
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
I think this guy can do it on

1325
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
You can't do it on command because you know in the wrong audio

1326
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
Someone might say

1327
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,839
There's two things that appear to be speaking in tongues

1328
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
According to this conversation

1329
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
And

1330
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,007
One of them is what we would understand

1331
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
As being in tongues

1332
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Speaking

1333
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:25,663
What could appear to be gibberish he Angels language and then it is given to someone else within the

1334
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
The Conch

1335
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,223
Aggregation

1336
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
Spread their word

1337
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,551
There's that and then there's also like you

1338
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,623
I'm speaking sometimes in known languages like where

1339
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
End up speaking

1340
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
Does a mother foreign language

1341
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
So you don't know right

1342
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,999
ROM

1343
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,023
That's one end of it

1344
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
But there's another end of it

1345
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
It's what is Henderson fella

1346
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
That describes kind of like

1347
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,215
It's like praying in tongues okay

1348
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
And I actually found this

1349
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
Incredibly fascinating

1350
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Because what

1351
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
He's describing

1352
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,871
Is essentially just

1353
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
Having a mantra

1354
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
He's just talking about

1355
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,735
Meditation with a mantra

1356
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,783
So he was in a little bit on this

1357
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,599
The truth is if I didn't have the gift

1358
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
The town's I wouldn't have a prayer

1359
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
For me parsley

1360
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Because

1361
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
If you have us

1362
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
Even your artists have you ever

1363
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,399
Try to spend any amount of time praying at all is one of the hardest

1364
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,191
Best things you'll ever do I remember

1365
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,055
Back when Larry Lee was so popular

1366
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,639
I was like I started trying to pray for an hour and I thought

1367
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:34,783
It's got to have been 30 minutes

1368
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,367
But but the cars I knew because I was filled with the spirit and I could

1369
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
Speak in tongues

1370
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927
When I did

1371
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,463
Deprived

1372
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,071
And then out of my prayer to Spirit

1373
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,679
Understanding would begin to unlock and I could pray in English and I pray in the spirit some more

1374
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,055
Origin of like the challenges of meditation

1375
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,871
It is kind of like boring

1376
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
If you're not used to it to sit

1377
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
4A in quietness

1378
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,479
Miss furlong.

1379
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,295
But one of the things that is advantageous about having

1380
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Mantra

1381
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,159
Is the deer words that don't necessarily mean anything

1382
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
And your primary language

1383
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,487
Is things that I like

1384
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,839
A sentence that has a meaning to you if you think that

1385
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,655
Then your brain will actively be thinking that

1386
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Think or

1387
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,543
Warchant repeat something that doesn't have an intrinsic meaning to you

1388
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
You have a better ability to let your mind

1389
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Settle

1390
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
And let your thoughts

1391
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
Supposed to

1392
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
Grabbing onto the thoughts as they happen

1393
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Something that

1394
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,343
Pretty basic meditation David Lynch

1395
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,951
Very similar

1396
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Transcendental Meditation

1397
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Meditation

1398
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,303
It's basically the same thing

1399
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,631
Yeah I mean hey you put enough new age

1400
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
B******* in there

1401
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:59,263
Maybe they'll get a little something out of it and I'll give you some praying in tongues

1402
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
Is what it is

1403
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
I just put it in there

1404
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
Much like meditation

1405
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,455
Whenever Henderson needs a little bit of clarity

1406
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
Yeah he goes and Appraisal

1407
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Meditation

1408
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
If I'm feeling

1409
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,135
Discouraged I'm feeling overwhelmed

1410
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
I can start pregnant spirit and what happens to me

1411
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,231
Is all of a sudden it's like

1412
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
The fall

1413
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Claire's

1414
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,559
And in a new

1415
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,583
Destroys to come

1416
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
And I move

1417
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
From

1418
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
Doubt and fear

1419
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Back in the face

1420
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,495
I mean that's what happens to me when I pray in the spirit

1421
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
That don't seem right because

1422
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
This is what I believe I believe

1423
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
Tongue

1424
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
Is an entry

1425
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Point

1426
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,199
Is the entry point

1427
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,527
Did we go through a gate into the supernatural Realms of God

1428
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,647
See this is all fun but like if you were if this was like a Hindu person saying this or like

1429
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
The Buddhist they would be like this is

1430
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,791
Heretical

1431
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,863
I mean I I do as somebody who is at scratches

1432
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
Is the time where I be

1433
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
More active and meditating

1434
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
Then

1435
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
Currently

1436
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,519
At the moment

1437
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
I've experienced some of

1438
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
EBenefits

1439
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,103
Are similar

1440
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,407
What he saying

1441
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
That calms

1442
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,223
State you can get into

1443
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,527
Definitely feel Supernatural X

1444
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,623
There's a book

1445
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Called

1446
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,975
A pilgrims way or the pilgrims way if I recall correctly

1447
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
And the

1448
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,583
Idea behind it is just there's a there's a dude

1449
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,423
He's like what does it mean in Thessalonians When God Says pray without ceasing

1450
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,263
And then it goes on this journey and talk to a bunch of wise men about it

1451
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,055
And ultimately he's just like

1452
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Do the prayer should be

1453
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Essentially yours

1454
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,151
You know the way you breathe in and breathe out

1455
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
Should have something

1456
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
To do with

1457
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
Mindfulness

1458
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,575
You know through the the whole crew

1459
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
Christianity meet those he

1460
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
To the same place that

1461
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Buddhism get

1462
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
It's too or that Hindu

1463
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
Gets through with that meditation of

1464
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
Controlling in a mindful

1465
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,351
There's something interesting about that

1466
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:05,215
That's not what they're not even a little bit

1467
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
Nope nope

1468
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
Sowell tractor

1469
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
I was looking for examples of Robert Andrew

1470
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,871
I'm talking about like

1471
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,151
When he's spoken

1472
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,967
And here's here's an example of

1473
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
And I found this to be

1474
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Compelling

1475
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,623
You can explain it to people

1476
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
Experience

1477
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
Tongue

1478
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
Oh now I understand

1479
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
I will never forget I was in a

1480
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
And I was leaving the primate

1481
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,447
We're all praying

1482
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
And we got through after about an hour

1483
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,615
He walks up to me and he says do you know French

1484
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
Cuz I think

1485
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
Expansion in Haiti and I said

1486
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:54,367
In the spirit

1487
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
You would say shoot him

1488
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
Is it do you know it's just a mess

1489
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Heated is French for I love you

1490
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,071
You were telling God in

1491
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,607
French the French language

1492
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,215
I love you every time you would finish whatever it is whatever else you were saying

1493
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,263
Yeah that's so amazing you know I've heard that

1494
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
Story so

1495
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
Many

1496
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,223
I've heard story or similar stories.

1497
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,503
Backupify

1498
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,087
Thoughts first, is not really

1499
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
I think the pronunciation

1500
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
The little bit off

1501
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,207
It also is a sound that you might just make

1502
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,279
You know like it sounds like something you might do

1503
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:39,935
It also sounds like maybe if you were screaming about how his evil than somebody might hear her

1504
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Satan

1505
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
Took French in high school

1506
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,103
Like zit time is more like I like

1507
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,175
The door is closer to I love you

1508
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,503
I don't know I don't

1509
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
A cappella

1510
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
If you were just be-bopping

1511
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
It's gotten a little bit

1512
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
You might come up with

1513
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,255
Yeah I mean there's no doubt if you've ever been to those like religious experience

1514
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,327
Kind of places you know I weigh I've been into a goddamn swear I felt

1515
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
The Holy Ghost

1516
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
Westin Southfield

1517
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,935
It's the same thing that happens with any large crowd as you

1518
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Start to feel the energy

1519
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,263
Do you get the same thing at the f****** music

1520
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
There's there's

1521
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
Like a collective

1522
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
Energy

1523
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
Or whatever

1524
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
There's a

1525
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
There's a and experience

1526
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
So

1527
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
We get back to praying in tongues

1528
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
Songs here and we learn

1529
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
This is how

1530
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,207
Our friend Robert came up with

1531
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
I don't know where

1532
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,047
I'm praying in tongues

1533
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:42,399
I'm praying in tongues I'm not having to think about it because you just blowing out of my spirit

1534
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,215
But it lets my mind be free

1535
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
To think about that scripture

1536
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,823
I'm praying in tongues and thinking about the and all of a sudden things

1537
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Just start unlock

1538
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
And I start seeing Revelation from that

1539
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Scripture

1540
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
That

1541
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
Can be life-changing

1542
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,807
And that's what happened to the court of

1543
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,111
Many other things that the Lords allow me the privilege

1544
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
To teach

1545
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
But it but it

1546
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Source

1547
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,255
My prayer language

1548
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,607
So he was eat users basically a meditating

1549
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,655
And came up with the idea of Heaven

1550
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Courts

1551
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,215
And then decided it was a revelation

1552
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
This is

1553
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
This is

1554
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
This is what happened

1555
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
This is what

1556
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,895
When an entire generation grows up

1557
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,943
With illegal marijuana

1558
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,247
Because if this guy was just

1559
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,551
Smoking weed and he had this idea be like

1560
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,391
That was a hilarious idea guys this was really great

1561
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
Let's get something to eat and we will never see

1562
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
Speakable

1563
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
I basically run

1564
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Don't do that

1565
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
And he would have friends

1566
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Because it's

1567
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
He's got weed

1568
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Emigrate

1569
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
Yeah but that might be wrong because he's

1570
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,127
I mean pretty good

1571
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Truth

1572
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,199
He's got too comfortable scampi

1573
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
With the

1574
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
Right

1575
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Leave that morning with him

1576
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,927
Myself emotionally have to live with the fact that he is hanging out with

1577
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
I'm so

1578
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Another thing

1579
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
It's very

1580
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,815
Interesting

1581
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
Within this

1582
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Is

1583
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
The universal

1584
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Proof

1585
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
That we always find

1586
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
That

1587
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
Any of these facts

1588
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
If it movie

1589
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,127
Sorry the movie

1590
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
I said

1591
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
To meet praying in the spirit

1592
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,503
And we're all old enough to remember the old Batman series

1593
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,063
When Commissioner Gordon

1594
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,439
Pick up the red phone it goes straight to the Batcave

1595
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Hey go straight to God

1596
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
Winona rapture

1597
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,559
It is Little Italy is a

1598
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,839
Hotline

1599
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
A hotline

1600
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
To God

1601
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Ithaca bat phone

1602
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
Seems to imply that other prayers.

1603
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
Just normal prayers

1604
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
They go to an answering service

1605
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
Pretty

1606
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,623
Wild you know is that God doesn't always

1607
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Check is inbox

1608
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
Fox first thing in the morning

1609
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,767
Correspondences

1610
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:21,375
Stop.

1611
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
Gmail inbox

1612
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
0

1613
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,495
I find this

1614
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,031
To be a little bit silly

1615
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
It is

1616
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,871
Is it is always funny to me that

1617
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,687
Whatever we really get down to all of these weirdos

1618
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,479
Is it comparing everything to movies like

1619
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
If you go back

1620
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Back and look at all of the

1621
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Culture that they

1622
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
Compare everything to

1623
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
It was almost

1624
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:48,511
80% and above made by people that they would despise

1625
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
Isn't hey you know

1626
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Like all of their

1627
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
Cultural Touchstone

1628
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
These were made by the very

1629
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
People they are trying

1630
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
To destroy now

1631
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
And they have

1632
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:03,359
No way to figure that out same thing with like Lori wishing to 65 so she could get Medicare

1633
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,687
I want to enjoy all the stuff

1634
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,991
That you guys make but I don't want to

1635
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,575
Yes sir we have one last clip year

1636
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Lori asking

1637
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
If

1638
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
And that is a

1639
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,743
Are these demons

1640
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,303
Can I understand it when you speak it

1641
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
In tongues

1642
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Like if you're praying in tongues

1643
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,143
Can the demons understand you

1644
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
So is it true

1645
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
That when you're praying

1646
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
Spirit

1647
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,287
Praying with your heavenly language

1648
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,359
That's going like you were talking about Batman and it goes

1649
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
R82 godso

1650
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Can

1651
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,759
The enemy can Satan understand that prayer language

1652
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
I don't think so

1653
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
I don't need I don't think

1654
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,623
I don't have

1655
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,439
Scripture verse for that but he doesn't we speak

1656
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
With the tongues of men

1657
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
And of angels

1658
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,839
Hey so I would say and if someone told me I agree with this

1659
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
And when you pray in tongues

1660
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,423
You're speaking you could be speaking in a known language

1661
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,751
Brighton

1662
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
Yeah

1663
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
Or you could be speaking in an or

1664
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,639
Language that used to be in the earth is not here anymore

1665
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,199
We speak in the tongues of angels

1666
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,527
And I tell people I said be very careful about

1667
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:18,111
Criticizing what a tongue sounds like you might be insulting an angel

1668
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,695
Don't f*** with the game okay

1669
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,487
If someone is speaking in tongues

1670
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
Don't say that cuz I can

1671
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,935
And also really

1672
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,495
If one person you remember have you ever heard that

1673
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,519
Story about that

1674
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
King wasn't wearing any clothes

1675
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,895
You know that everybody as long as everybody was like yeah he's wearing clothes

1676
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:46,015
What's that assholes like he's not wearing any clothes

1677
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,039
He's an a******

1678
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
You kids are out

1679
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,439
Yeah I think

1680
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,559
I mean I don't know how where's yone this was but I thought there was literally no chance

1681
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,631
That I could resist telling you about heaven

1682
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Have a cart

1683
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
Is it too good

1684
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
The joy and the Mirth

1685
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:10,847
It's just too good I would like to bring some of that happiness into the world 2

1686
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
Negate

1687
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,663
The negative feelings that I have

1688
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,199
How about everybody tweeting

1689
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,271
I goddamn stupid Alex Jones meme

1690
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
Then can

1691
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
Devil's understand the meme

1692
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Probably

1693
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
Can I record for that meeting

1694
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,279
Damages what you like Dan

1695
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
Is there a jury award

1696
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,031
Can I also add this was not at all

1697
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Adequately

1698
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Disgust

1699
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,103
And that's why I need to watch more of

1700
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
What if you don't

1701
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
What you want

1702
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,503
It's not predestined

1703
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,063
Since it's not in the book so there was no prophecy

1704
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
For you to take.

1705
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,415
Is it possible that you go to court and God says

1706
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,487
Can you lose a case in heaven

1707
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
You never really addresses

1708
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Now I don't think

1709
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,607
It's a good idea to get

1710
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,911
Bogged down with all these little nuances

1711
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,239
Yeah that you're a good boy

1712
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
About havenscourt let's

1713
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
Get in the weeds with the legalese of it

1714
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,223
How do you create a god

1715
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
Perfect

1716
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
And yet still has to

1717
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
To go to court

1718
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,855
Conceptions about court order

1719
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,159
Generally really bogged down

1720
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
Specific

1721
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,999
And technicalities those are the things that like a really

1722
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:35,583
Important to the law

1723
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,655
Like to see a little bit more of that what are the major

1724
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Precedence

1725
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,703
Yeah

1726
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:46,335
Does God respect Brown V. Board of education is there anything that's been overturned it Evans

1727
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,735
Got still fine with segregation

1728
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,807
Probably

1729
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
Hotels on Friday

1730
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,767
Down the road

1731
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Couple days

1732
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,095
Until we are back

1733
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
We have wept

1734
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Sunny do its knowledge right.com

1735
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,943
But so then I mean

1736
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
The sex robot

1737
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,367
Alex
