1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:17,408
A little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Jordan

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
How do you feel about a good song

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,576
Who are you

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,416
I like a AAA concealed as a boxer

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
I like a True Skate

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,304
If I'm going for a cracker I'll probably get address

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
I absolutely have no use

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
4

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
The very boring cracker it reminds me of times that I would go to the

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
The nurse's office

13
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
XXX faking sick

14
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
Electric wire

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,880
Yep I have that Gatorade

16
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
2

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Throughout

18
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Electrolytes

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
Play Drake backup

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Experienced a good salt

21
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
Yeah it's my position on it

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,032
I love the way

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
I don't think I've ever

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,176
Experience to good salt I like a Wheat Thin from time to

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Time

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,832
How do you feel about for Keebler buttery Christmas is for you

27
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
That rounds out

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
Actors and not others

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
So Jordan today was good interesting episode back in the past in 2013

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Who's doing the aftermath

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
Sandy Hook of course we are on February

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
First 23rd

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,480
Game today one day only

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,064
Weird f****** show okay I was so disoriented by it

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
Pleasurable experiences I've had

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
Preparing an episode

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
Just because I was so

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
All over the

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Alex

40
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
Follower

41
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,680
It was a situation I felt so untethered

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
The 2013. Like it doesn't get sad

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
I'm feels different

44
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
It's just lunch

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Completely all over the place

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
It will get the how and why what happened

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,600
But before we do I need to give a little bit of a correction from our episode

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
We talked about there being reports

49
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Play Purge

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Done by Kim Jeong Hoon

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Some government officials in the aftermath of

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Failed Summit with the Donald

53
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
And as it turns out those were erroneous report

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
I apologize to everybody that I got that wrong

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
At the time that we recorded the episode

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
That was what was being referred to

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
And I operated off

58
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
What was being reported

59
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
Now the more important piece of it was

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
I wasn't

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Reporting's

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
As to stay

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
Here is what's happening in North Korea this is the news

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
I was discussing it in the context

65
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Alex Jones believe this to be true

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
And his

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Response to it is

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Cool

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
More accurately I guess

70
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,200
Not the best way to send a signal it's all right

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
So the conversation of it being whether it is true or not

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
You know we dropped the ball a little bit

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Bigger piece of it is

74
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
It's still stands alone

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
Weather the story that

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Is true or not

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
You know Alex Jones

78
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Response to that story

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Under the assumption of it being true was fuked up

80
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah that's that's a little bit like

81
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
Look we we got the reporting wrong

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
But Alex did still see that guy that's a great

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
His take on it

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah I want the reasons why

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
I find the present a little bit less gratifying to cover

86
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
As much as

87
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
There there's a possibility

88
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
For the greater possibility

89
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Things like that misunderstanding

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
Bad reporting that you read and then by the time the episode

91
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Goes up

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
Has been corrected

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
24-hour news cycle

94
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Absolutely think so

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Definite downsides of it

96
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
These things

97
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,959
2013 February 1st

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
And are supporting the show

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
Next web

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
I'm a policy wonk

101
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
You're now policy walk

102
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
Text Lillian take you so much

103
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Very much so

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Taylor thank you so much

105
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,647
Heroin

106
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
Is freakishly large

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Appreciate

108
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
So

109
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Rottweiler verse

110
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
This first clip is only interesting

111
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Central

112
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
Eastern

113
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
Very standard introduction to the show

114
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,759
Note of that before our show

115
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Yes he's doing 3 hours

116
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Another hour

117
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
Go to overdrive overdrive for like 5 minutes

118
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
For something

119
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm only making note of this to show that like he often does not know what he's going to do

120
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
Or what his schedule is going to be like when he starts the show

121
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
I did an extra hour another extra hours

122
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Think it's indicative that the spirit

123
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,623
Is Indian whatever you doing he wants to be doing because of

124
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
I don't like that

125
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Well

126
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,303
You know is that clip he did say Lord willing

127
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
I'll be back on Sunday

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Yes you could take that kind of religion

129
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Office episode quite religious

130
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,615
But I should say that he always

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Since you know that I got a little bit of

132
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
Big

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Episode

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
Post-tribulation rapture

135
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Which we know he's a big fan

136
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Kinkos Bastrop

137
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Yeah that's bulshit

138
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
He believes and we'll get into this a little bit later in the episode he believes that the idea of a pre-tribulation rapture

139
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Concocted by the globalist

140
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Because they were scared of the Christians

141
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Ability to

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
To take them out

143
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
The the Christian

144
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,343
It's okay don't worry about raptured before all the trouble that we're going to cause

145
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Okay

146
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Is either.

147
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Raptors

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,399
We're going to have to think about a little bit

149
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
But before we do Alex

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
To talk about

151
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Play the Chris

152
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Used to be

153
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
So

154
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Against tyranny

155
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
But now they don't care

156
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Because

157
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
Pre-trib rapture

158
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,295
That's today

159
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Georgia

160
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Laden

161
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Sociology

162
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Important psychology

163
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,503
If you've been listening along to these 2013 episodes in the aftermath

164
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Gruas

165
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,391
This this focus on priem post-trib Rapture is very much like

166
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
What is happy

167
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Sucking extended the gold commercial at the end of the previous episode

168
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Parks

169
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Security guard

170
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,103
What's the date before this

171
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Grunts at you

172
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
You got to start thinking about the end

173
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Perfect sense

174
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
You know first thing that happens

175
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Then the very next

176
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,439
Daddy is just like I don't know what's going to happen next but I hope there's a

177
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
It's just it's very weird

178
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
In congruence from a narrative perspective like

179
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
So

180
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Also I should say I've been hearing Alex no King but King

181
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Jesus a b

182
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,871
Emmys 2013 episode

183
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Some kind of phrasing

184
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Paraphrasing tool

185
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Scripture that I don't remember

186
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
So I just decided to leave it alone

187
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
But for some reason this time I don't know why

188
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
It hit my ears a little bit

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
And maybe it's because of that jarring

190
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Shift from

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
What he was doing

192
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
This this religiosity

193
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
Different

194
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
If I can trace down

195
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
Where that phrase came from and what we can learn about Alex

196
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
From his repeated use of it to attack Obama

197
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
Turns out there's something

198
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Too clearly right

199
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
As The Story Goes

200
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
Reverend

201
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
Clark on the night of April 8th

202
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
1970s

203
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
Clark was a pastor and said to be involved in the local militia

204
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
As the men gathered Paul Revere arrive in Warren that the Brits

205
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
British major Pitcairn showed up

206
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
He demanded that the men lay down their arms

207
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Do it the Patriots were said to have replied

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,455
We recognize no Sovereign but God and no key

209
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
King Vegeta

210
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
There's a lot of problems

211
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
Historical perspective neither John Adams

212
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Karen arrived historically

213
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
It was Samuel Adam

214
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Attended the meeting

215
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Clark's house.

216
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Brewer and Patriot

217
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
Very detailed account of the question April 18th

218
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Deep 1775 doesn't include

219
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,127
You can't trust but plenty of other dialogue

220
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Mansion had it happen

221
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
It's unclear if this framing of the quote in this fashion actual

222
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Exist anywhere prior to

223
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
John Ashe

224
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Minecraft game

225
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
At the noted Evangelical Christian School Bob Jones University

226
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Hey what she said quote

227
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
A slogan of the American Revolution which was so distressing to the emissaries of the kings that it was founded correspondences

228
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Back to England

229
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Was the line we have no key

230
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
King Vegeta

231
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Tax Collectors came

232
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
And Colin it's frequently said we have no key

233
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
King budgies

234
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
Restaurant was George W Bush's Attorney General

235
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Sobe certainly weird

236
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
If that was where I was

237
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Take me to Crossroads

238
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
F****** hate

239
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,951
George W George W bush and all things related to him

240
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
That's weird

241
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
That one though

242
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
For my Morrison

243
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Diversion

244
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
The story of that night

245
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
April 18th

246
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
That was told by Charles

247
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Eugenics

248
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
King George

249
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,551
Version of the story

250
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Almost every

251
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
Matches up with Alex's story

252
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
Mattress up also with Charles

253
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
Leader in the Christian identity movement

254
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Which was a religious group that was very popular among

255
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Extreme right in the

256
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,471
1880s for your first sentence

257
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
Right around that was popular with this that

258
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,895
Alex probably would have been right around the time he was coming of age

259
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,479
Sounds right

260
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
Christian identity members called for the liquidation of the UN

261
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
They didn't believe in paying taxes

262
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Suzanne argued that the sheriff was the highest constitutional Authority

263
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Is a heavy heavy overlap

264
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
Virion

265
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Likely to call it a coincidence

266
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
This is important

267
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
Because

268
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
The first person to articulate

269
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
The fabricated

270
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
The quote Alex's

271
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Heatedly saying comes

272
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Seems to be

273
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
And Beyond

274
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
James is also a huge races

275
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Biolage

276
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
From an article in St Louis posted

277
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
Dispatch from March 5th 2000 about Charles Jenkins

278
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Christian identity conference

279
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Being held in Branson Missouri

280
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Children sit with their parents

281
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
The speaker Charles agent

282
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Call Tim cell

283
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
And said he was pleased with the quality of our races in this room

284
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
What audience member who applauded Jennings

285
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Beach was top Rob

286
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
The Grand Dragon

287
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
The Klu Klux Klan

288
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
American Revolution

289
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
For preachers who are leaders in

290
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
The Christian Movement

291
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
It implies a very foundational problem with his voice

292
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
Namely that he believes to be actually

293
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Respect that's what I was generally means

294
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
He says lower

295
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
Strong races

296
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
Contacts at like this strong

297
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Connected Force

298
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Between neutrons and

299
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Protons and then the week

300
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
I think it just means

301
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Emphatically

302
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
This lady has very

303
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Alex

304
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Believe this

305
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Articulation of

306
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
A story that absolutely didn't happen

307
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Historically

308
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
What was used

309
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Fairly

310
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Propaganda

311
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,607
Weis

312
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
So

313
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
Episode from the 29th

314
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Steve. Alex

315
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
Robert Barnes were talking about Heather psychic

316
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Alex has long felt this way

317
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
How do you do this

318
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Pappadeaux

319
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
You're never right I'm Amazed by that myself

320
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
The present

321
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,615
Completely identical

322
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
To be like

323
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Relic between

324
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
I don't understand how that works I was waiting for and I was going to jump out my window

325
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,303
I was waiting for the simulation

326
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
So

327
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Valex is literary love

328
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Spell bored

329
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Enjoy this

330
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
I couldn't cut this

331
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Flip out

332
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Despise

333
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
Fear is the mind-killer

334
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
Philosopher

335
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Frank Herbert

336
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Is the mind-killer

337
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,471
Google petite Mort

338
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Hey

339
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
Frank Herbert comes up

340
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
Frank Herbert

341
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Doolin

342
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Yeah

343
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Amazing novels

344
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Leave the Brian Herbert

345
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
Theranos

346
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Fair enough

347
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
This cliff

348
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
In the same way

349
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
For you as a dude lover

350
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Thank you this one

351
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,639
Here's what I want explain

352
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Infowars.com

353
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Si.com

354
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
Dot-com

355
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
British royal Commission on population

356
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
It's

357
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Congress of the United States

358
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
It is not I love you f****** bragging about geography

359
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,735
It makes me wonder if he's not aware of how poorly done it is

360
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,831
Like if he just gave

361
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
And they just turned in shity homework at he wasn't paying never check

362
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,279
Yeah that sounds pretty implausible on now he's just never checked in

363
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
I just assumed

364
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
For whatever

365
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
I told Rob do f****** get the bibliography together

366
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
And because Broadview

367
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Can't

368
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Because their makeup

369
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Alex

370
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Bibliography I can't put a meme

371
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
I found a patriot Message Board years ago doesn't

372
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
Play almost like a dove

373
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,727
12

374
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
It was it was a large percentage of them but I don't know what the gross

375
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Number one

376
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
How do I do on our Wiki I do have a running

377
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,759
Completely made up quotes

378
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
I love it

379
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
I always love it

380
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Geography

381
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Terrifyingly plausible that he

382
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Just have no idea

383
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
I consider that

384
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
He is terrible

385
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Employees

386
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
You probably

387
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
Right

388
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
When is operation

389
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Not a bug

390
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
It's protective

391
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Yeah yeah

392
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,943
Next talks about Bill Gates

393
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
Speech

394
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
TED Talk

395
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
You might

396
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
You might start to notice a little bit of

397
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
At the beginning

398
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Little bit religious

399
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
Yeah talking about you no no

400
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
King Kong

401
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
And then he start he got into the

402
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
The bibliography for

403
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And he starts

404
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Weaving

405
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Kind of a lot

406
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Endgame

407
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
Well no cuz then

408
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
This is Bill Gates talking about

409
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Extermination

410
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
Bill Gates kubicek

411
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
TED Talk

412
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
That Alex is going to misrepresent

413
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Beverly

414
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Clip where he discusses

415
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Alex thinks you talking about

416
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Destroying all

417
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Extender

418
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
Which means

419
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
Branches of government

420
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
Asian

421
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
So for long time

422
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,920
What Alex was there cuz I've heard that sort of thing

423
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
I thought that represent Bill Gates

424
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Like Bill Gates made a dump

425
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
Joke and Alex

426
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
Like I thought

427
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Was it Bill Gates

428
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
The ad made a joke about that

429
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
And then like

430
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
This number

431
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:05,216
A population could be zero that would suck

432
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
I went back and re-watch that TED Talk

433
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,384
Joke it's just the audience laughing at a poorly set-up slideshow

434
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,760
That's all that's going on laughing at him

435
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
Disastrous effect

436
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
We need to get carbon emissions down

437
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Close to zero as we

438
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
He brings up his equation

439
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Where carbon emissions equals

440
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
People X

441
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Number of service

442
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
Services

443
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
X

444
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
CO2 produced

445
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
A unit of energy

446
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
This equation

447
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
He goes into

448
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Variable one by one

449
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
It says that for the equation

450
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,224
2 equal zero one of the variables is going to have to get pretty close to zero

451
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
In the meantime

452
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
Has moved on to his life or the variable of people

453
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
Search shows a bunch of people on the

454
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,512
The screen Oso everybody Rigsby

455
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,912
People in everybody

456
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
Are the Bill Gates even realizes

457
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Slide his chain

458
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Or if he does

459
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
He doesn't seem to understand why people

460
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Yeah that actually does

461
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
That sounds right on both counts

462
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
I believe that he does not understand why people laugh explicitly says that the population is going up

463
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Provide appropriate Healthcare

464
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Can slow the rate of that rise a little bit

465
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
Variable should go down go down

466
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Argument is about how

467
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
The efficiency

468
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
CO2 per unit of energy

469
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Are you actually have a

470
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Chance of bacon

471
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,544
This Peach is very clear if you listen to all of it that has nothing

472
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Population

473
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Bring you that b*******

474
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Has everything to do

475
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
With creating

476
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,808
I mean if you can't really argue with it

477
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
The people time Services times efficiency

478
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
3 * 302

479
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
A unit

480
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
That does make sense

481
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
What all those add up to 2

482
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,096
Be close to zero

483
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Closest gyro drop all of them

484
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
They will all be dropped for us

485
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:23,200
That one could be the one that's closest to 0

486
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
Variables that you may have possibility

487
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Nature will change

488
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
Is explicitly against

489
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Depopulation

490
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Rich's in Irish

491
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Yes

492
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Yeah that is

493
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,352
The reality of the

494
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
Situation is the result

495
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,984
Of the reality of Alex

496
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
It's from

497
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Anything in that equation

498
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
Korean propaganda

499
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:56,736
It is very apocalypse

500
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
He's a depopulation agent

501
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:04,416
49 Royal Commission

502
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
I'm very excited to announce

503
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,328
I figured out how Alex Jones knows the word actuary

504
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,544
All the time context

505
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Report

506
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
1049 report of the royal Commission on population

507
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Was conducted by an actuary

508
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:32,064
The 1949 result was the result of the report was the result of a five-year study on population

509
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,672
What are the concern about that confirming the conventional accepted

510
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
2.33 repeating

511
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
2 1/3 children were required

512
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
Population

513
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
And this is one of the Benny primary Quest

514
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
The commission set out to

515
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,520
What they found more less boiled down to it being

516
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
Quote the size of the family has remained comparatively stable for 20 years at about two point

517
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Two children per married couple

518
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
Percent deficient for population

519
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Airport called

520
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Itself out however for not being able to

521
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
You predict

522
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
From lowering ages of marriages which was it

523
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,512
Beginning to happen around the Sun

524
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
As well as

525
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Decreased

526
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Infant mortality

527
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
So that's 6% deficiency

528
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Replacement

529
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
It might not even been Acura

530
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
An analysis of the report which is done two years after its release mirrors

531
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Disconcern

532
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,456
It explicitly lays out how to use more data has made the 1949 after effect

533
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
The analysis goes on to say quote

534
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
It will course be argued the two years

535
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
For now projections

536
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
That is no doubt true enough

537
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
But skepticism should not be allowed to stifle all Creed.

538
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
So

539
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
There's a built

540
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,168
Trends that are happening

541
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
That make this in

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Incomplete picture but it's worth doing anyway

543
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
To know if our future analysis

544
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
These mean anything

545
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
Let's see how wrong we are and why now and then later on

546
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Recognition process

547
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
What are the chief findings of the report was that fertility rates

548
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Decreasing at whatever rate they word

549
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
What's the result of people being

550
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
It was the result of people having a

551
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Choice about having kids

552
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
For the first time it pretty much ever

553
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,264
The oral contraception would not be approved by the f

554
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
PA until 9

555
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
61

556
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896
1946 Family Planning centers

557
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
Advising people in Britain about

558
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Techniques

559
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
One level I suspect Alex probably

560
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Reported

561
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Because it was one of the

562
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
The first in Britain

563
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
Recommend the first control should be made available through Health Services

564
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Which drew the Savoy

565
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
Buri are the religious community surprise

566
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
In an article in the Catholic Herald

567
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,240
There is not a spark of religion about it is purely pagan

568
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Example

569
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
Of the way in which the mind of England

570
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Is gone pagan

571
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,200
If we give women an inch over our lives

572
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
Make sure everything is under our control the more conservative

573
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
British taxes

574
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Report primarily for that reason

575
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,048
It stands to reason that this is a groundbreaking report in terms of open

576
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Disgusting family

577
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
What all Alex's

578
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
I sincerely wish that I could say with certainty with Alex

579
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
The talkin about

580
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
He talked about the 1949 Royal Commission on population

581
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
But it's pretty hard to find context

582
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Clues

583
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
He just says

584
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
This report is at the at the

585
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
Prisonplanet the entire website

586
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,648
If you search them for any sort of irrigation two words 90

587
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,464
T49 Royal commission report

588
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
Literally nothing comes up

589
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
That can't be real

590
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,120
Forever and never song

591
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
To write

592
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
What is the point

593
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Complaining about this report

594
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
That's crazy

595
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
I wonder if Alex maybe just

596
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Fell down

597
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Drunk

598
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
Front of a library and somebody was walking out with

599
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
That Commission

600
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Somehow

601
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
His brain

602
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
I thought that's just what he referenced I strongly suspect what it is

603
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
He's heard other people in the

604
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Patriot

605
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Right wing

606
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Communities

607
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Complain about it but maybe on message boards and

608
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
And newsletters

609
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
You would read

610
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
5 these

611
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Paranoid John Birch

612
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,752
Society of Jason sweaters that would go out

613
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
In the early days

614
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
They would make referee

615
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Or W Cleon skousen

616
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Might have brought it up in

617
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
One of his writings without

618
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
What's love

619
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
His main problem was with the

620
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Dafont

621
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Who is wing ding

622
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
What does a mistake

623
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,232
Wish they could go back in time

624
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816
I think that it's possible that he's heard about it secondhand

625
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,376
Who was pissed off about it because

626
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Birth control

627
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,544
And the cycle of stupidity and the Cat's in the Cradle and the silver spoon

628
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
To talk about it from a perspective of like

629
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
I'm against this because it advocated

630
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
For people being allowed

631
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Contraception

632
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Recognize

633
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Treat you like that

634
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
I think you just doesn't want people

635
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
To know that that's his argument

636
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
It seems like that's the only thing you could possibly be

637
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Yeah

638
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
It's very confusing

639
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Figure out what year

640
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
What do you mean

641
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
Cookie Swirl of s*** is just about

642
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Contraception

643
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,384
I think that he

644
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Either

645
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Of his own volition

646
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Or based on something

647
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
He read somewhere else

648
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
It all traces back to just

649
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Resistor

650
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
The idea of the

651
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
The freedom

652
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
That is offer

653
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
By having a choice

654
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
Giving birth

655
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Yeah but Alex is talking

656
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
Hear about

657
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
This is this is why I

658
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Cuz you still

659
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Sorta talk

660
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
About

661
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
He's talking about

662
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
This is directly contradictory

663
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
Something to eat generally

664
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
Don't they have 20 kids

665
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
They want to do

666
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,472
Destroy the world and you can tell because they don't have

667
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,152
The globalist

668
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
It's just been

669
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Because they've been

670
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:58,368
Eating so many of them I guess

671
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Zion drum supplies

672
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,304
A lot of this stuff

673
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Cut out a lot of clips

674
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
That's going back over everyday

675
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Hun

676
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Post office

677
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
Endgame last night and was like

678
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:24,480
I could see him rubbing one out to his own movie

679
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
Brilliant brain rub out

680
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
It's so we have this

681
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Kind of religious

682
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Friend going on

683
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
I have this app game

684
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
And I think it comes

685
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Together in the

686
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
It's very strange.

687
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
When I told you the beginning

688
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
This episode

689
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Very untether

690
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Because of this vibe

691
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
I think that this clip really well in body

692
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
That sort of

693
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
What he

694
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
To the table

695
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
And it made me

696
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Deeply on

697
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Europe

698
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
Even my family

699
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
3 minutes

700
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,472
On the PowerPoint

701
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Child of

702
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Iowa score

703
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,184
Red pile of skulls

704
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,744
Standing ovation

705
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
So

706
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,480
I was very close to leaving the clip out of the theft

707
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
And just kind of

708
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
Trying to find

709
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
The new point

710
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,672
Alex brought him up game

711
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Little bit

712
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
Ultimately I felt

713
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
Really represented this energy that Alex has

714
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
On the show

715
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
It's Super Why

716
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
His manner is entirely different.

717
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
The previous episodes

718
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
In 2013

719
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
He has the air of a

720
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Creature to

721
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
More than he normally does

722
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
The repetition of it

723
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,552
The end of eclipse

724
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
Made me feel very unsettled

725
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Simultaneously

726
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
He's doing a shitload of rehash

727
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Is it like weed

728
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,608
We watched it the night before he was reminded what

729
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:26,240
I'll just remind you to do that

730
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:31,360
Sorry guys get back on track

731

Literally the day before this episode he was telling fake stories about grunting Park Rangers

735
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
Is today doing the preacher in

736
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Literally nothing feels right about this episode

737
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
It makes me feel really

738
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
You f***** up

739
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
I don't know what to do with it

740
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
And we'll see how it

741
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Hands up playing

742
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Bisquick

743
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Completely line

744
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
About dr. Eric.

745
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,808
Bianca is one of Alex's favorite go-to examples of members of the

746
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
The Intelligencer

747
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
Depopulation

748
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Who is playing

749
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Interesting Lee in pretty much

750
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
All the time

751
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
I was listening to Alex

752
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
The only thing

753
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
Brings up about Bianca

754
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Is this one

755
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,424
Where people gave the standing ovation for rooting for airborne

756
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Ebola

757
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Interesting

758
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,128
Let's just saw headline 2006

759
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
He's been riffing on it ever

760
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
Back in April 2006 are kyanka was giving a speech

761
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
The Texas Academy of Science

762
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
It was a speech that he delivered

763
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Or called The Vanishing book of

764
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,488
Is an evolutionary ecologist

765
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
The speech was about to

766
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
Tastrophe that was living in the ecos

767
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,144
Catastrophe that we have willed into existence through an axe

768
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,264
50 ride a new speech every year cuz you can't really tore on the same hour

769
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
I'm over and over and over again

770
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
Charlie sure how long he been doing these bit

771
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
Before this without into

772
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Alright

773
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
But on that April day

774
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
Was named Forest meme

775
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,488
Horse anasshole is named for

776
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
He's not he's not to be confused with the rapper meme

777
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
Who did that song This Is Why I'm Hot

778
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
He was named Forest

779
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
Memes Dark Forest memes is an amateur scientist

780
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Skeptical

781
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
About time comfortable saying he's not assigned

782
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
Of course it doesn't stop

783
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
The University of Nations

784
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Kona Hawaii

785
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Unfortunately the University of Nations

786
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,976
College ocfo Pablo Rivera was sentenced to prison life

787
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,048
3.1 million dollars from the school

788
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
He created fake invoices

789
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
Used to make up the money that the four left the school

790
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,568
What are the things he allegedly bought with the money was a gold mine in Sierra Leone

791
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
So that dude is real cool

792
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
That's like chicken all of the all of the boxes of evil

793
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,440
Gold mine in Sierra Leone of course I'm going to buy that I've already reached the state of Mont

794
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Osterhoudt where

795
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,816
There's no recourse for me and help well there's actually one box left the check off

796
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
You stole from the school so I don't know

797
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Nine-tenths of the law

798
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
Anyway that's

799
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
House is not in order

800
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Is what I would say

801
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,232
Kind of amazing that the guys who describe themselves

802
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
The Skeptics are the ones most often

803
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,632
Been taken in by these kind of place that I actually

804
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:11,520
General in 1988 Mims alleged Scientific American

805
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Views

806
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
This in combination with his disbelief

807
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Climate change

808
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,480
The sharp Focus

809
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Doctor

810
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
And it's an expression of them

811
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Is being an a******

812
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
First Mims was there for this

813
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,720
Can you took it upon himself to write an article on his website that was covered

814
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
5

815
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Gazette Enterprise

816
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
I believe it was just

817
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
I would say

818
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Crying and cheering fans like a baby

819
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
No no

820
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
This article of the local papers at Washington

821
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
Sensationalize report Avianca

822
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
The speech was then picked up by The Drudge Report

823
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Immediately

824
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Come on

825
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,320
Analyze the quote

826
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Provided

827
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
To The Gazette Enterprise

828
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
And compared them to

829
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Transcript of Bianca

830
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Speech

831
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Add up

832
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
The quotes were taken entirely out of context

833
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
Text an offer from different parts

834
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,680
People who were there came forward and called Mims assessment a quote dishonest mischaracterization

835
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
And said quote doctor Pianka in no way advocated billions of deaths from Ebola or said anything that would lead a reason

836
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
I've read the speech and I 100

837
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
I concur with this

838
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
I find it very hard to believe that someone could reach

839
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
The conclusions that Mims did

840
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
Without doing so intense

841
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,928
The right would never ever use that

842
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
That doesn't sound

843
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
Information becomes pretty clear that men's would likely offended by Bianca

844
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,520
Phone doesn't care for creationist in climate denial position

845
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
It is speech Bianca said quote

846
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
The biggest enemy we face is anthropocentrism

847
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,223
Attitude that everything on Earth

848
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
It was put there for RJ

849
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
To be use anyway we want

850
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Which is a direct opposition

851
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,391
Into the Bible which we know creation

852
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Generally do

853
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
Is Bianca

854
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Studio

855
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
Mims is a fellow of the discovery

856
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
Which exists specifically to

857
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
To quote make

858
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Intelligent design the dominant

859
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Perspective in science

860
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
Mirror prominent evolutionary

861
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Ecologist

862
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
As an advocate of human extermination

863
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
In the Fallout Bianca receive

864
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Rapunzel death

865
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Even reported him to Homeland

866
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
Insecurities as a bioterror

867
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
This harassment campaign

868
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Seriously out of hand

869
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
Will you take a closer look at

870
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
Absolutely based on a willful misrepresentation

871
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
The closest thing that you can

872
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Come to m

873
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
I'm saying something

874
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
He's close to this

875
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
Is in the quote he does say

876
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
Something along the lines of

877
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
The world would be better off

878
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
If there were 10 to 24

879
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:58,175
Percent of us

880
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
People wear that he wants the world

881
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
Dude I just that

882
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,551
The natural is illogical systems

883
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,623
Call Rick better

884
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
So I don't know everything is just a wealth of

885
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Mischaracterization

886
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,071
And this is the only thing that Alex knows is the smear

887
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Oh yeah guy

888
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
The right-wing is so good at that

889
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,007
Getting some small dumb and nocuous life

890
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
From some idiot in the middle of f*** nowhere

891
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
And turning it into

892
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
The

893
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Lake house

894
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
The middle of nowhere

895
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Professor

896
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
No not him

897
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
Punishment

898
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Because it is

899
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
He's someone who's

900
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,023
He does know a good bit

901
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
Self-taught

902
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
Electrical engineering

903
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Electrical

904
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,727
Yeah from from other side

905
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,823
No right I agree but because of that he had a position within

906
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
Texas Academy

907
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Appliances

908
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
Okay

909
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
Auspices that are appropriate

910
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
It's one of those interests

911
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
He got out of his Lane

912
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
And his creationist

913
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,439
Climate denial position

914
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
I think led him to

915
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
Great offense

916
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
It's like a veterinarian and we all know that

917
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,471
Also want everything is really important to remember is that Alex's

918
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Completely lying about research

919
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Slideshow

920
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
Descriptive speech and I mentioned Bianca includes

921
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Is graphics

922
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Alex's tacos

923
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
In about

924
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
Skulls

925
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
6 cartoon skulls

926
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
Next to a cartoon of Skeletor

927
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
It's a part of this

928
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Talking about trying to find images to go along with this

929
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
It's clearly

930
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
How to know that if you looked into it at all

931
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
But he would know exactly what he knows

932
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,447
If he'd only read the account from Mims that was reposted on Drudge

933
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Which says quote

934
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,055
Pionk event displayed a slideshow with rows of human skulls

935
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,871
Had red lights flashing from it

936
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
That one with red lights

937
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Flashing

938
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
It was

939
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
Skeletor

940
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
From He-Man

941
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
Is the most

942
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Annoying

943
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
It's saying that I have heard

944
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Since our last

945
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
Goddamn episode Dan reality

946
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:34,079
Is where Alex is like we looked search the image

947
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
If you search

948
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
For the images

949
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,207
Human skulls

950
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
Is misrepresenting a description

951
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
It's only unfair

952
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:06,335
Technically accurate

953
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
If you want me to take

954
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:13,759
Because it's so highlights how little work out

955
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,831
Yeah but you do want to check into what

956
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,927
Yeah that makes it very very point of lies about his process

957
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
Lies about the work that he does

958
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Because he needs to

959
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
So we get off there

960
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
Like I said

961
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Religious vibe

962
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Through

963
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
And the

964
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Don't know

965
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Why

966
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
So it's not 42

967
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
This one's more current

968
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Although

969
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
Making him hold up newspaper is now it all of these

970
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,023
Def just to confirm when the date is

971
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
This one's current

972
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Beatles

973
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
Homeland Security

974
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,175
License plate stand

975
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
Major cities

976
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
Talking about a specific veteran who got arrested

977
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:10,751
For a possession of a weapon

978
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:15,359
Full over anyone who's of that

979
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
Desperate plea

980
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Join us

981
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
And you know what we're going to do

982
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:31,487
Find all of the homeless veterans because

983
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
What do you say

984
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,863
Commercial

985
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
The story that he's talking about the Pacifica

986
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
Haddad

987
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
Veteran who was arrested after he was found

988
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Being possession

989
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Illegal weapons accessories

990
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,663
In specific he had 30 round magazine

991
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
For an AR-15 and AR 7

992
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
Then which is really illegal

993
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
New York

994
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,855
As it turns out this may not be the case of overzealous cops

995
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,415
Just pulling over

996
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
It was likely the result of a sting operation

997
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,511
What are the things that makes me

998
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,583
That is at the edge article about his arrest

999
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
It clearly states

1000
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
Doesn't seem like how you would describe someone at a check

1001
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,031
Also the article says that he was parked because he had quote

1002
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,895
Advertise the magazines for sale on Craigslist and was waiting to meet a potential buyer

1003
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Okay so you're you're thinking the cops may have found that Craig's

1004
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:35,231
Really bad planning whatever you're trying to commit an illegal sale of goods

1005
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
You don't want to

1006
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,839
You don't want to advertise it like a lot of people do that on Craigslist

1007
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:44,191
Nevermind this is a basic piece of primary reporting that all the Conservative Christian

1008
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
To gloss over

1009
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
They all say that he was arrested for possessing

1010
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Which

1011
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
But he was

1012
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
He was arrested for trying to sell them

1013
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,455
Which they don't want to because it hurts their basic argument of

1014
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
These magazines are safe and good in the hands of Ben

1015
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,343
Upstanding veteran

1016
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,743
Veteran really bad the moment hands them over in exchange for money

1017
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,911
These magazines are specifically for military use only so obviously sneakily traffic trafficking

1018
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Isn't a good thing

1019
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:21,311
Either way it doesn't matter because I just got a slap-on-the-wrist with a conditional discharge

1020
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,127
Here to pay the $200 fine but consider

1021
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,711
I became a cause celeb of the right-wing militia Patriot world

1022
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,039
He raised over $50,000 and online campaign

1023
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:35,135
It's very likely you made a profit

1024
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
Items

1025
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
Destined for math

1026
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
Not

1027
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Sara Lee.

1028
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:48,959
I don't know that yeah that's that's all I could find in the the article about the disposition

1029
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
Navigate I don't know

1030
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Entirely

1031
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
If you like reoffended

1032
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,615
Because that conditional discharge is basically like

1033
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Suspended

1034
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Kind of thing

1035
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
If you get arrested again

1036
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
We can recharge

1037
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
Okay

1038
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,295
For a certain

1039
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
Reminder time

1040
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Then you just have this Vine

1041
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
I don't know

1042
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,719
I don't know how I feel about it I think it's probably not

1043
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,399
But whatever local cases

1044
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
2013

1045
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:28,639
Someone else definitely say they would Alex is doing

1046
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
I don't I don't know about

1047
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
Skorts

1048
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
So Alex

1049
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
When I listen to this episode

1050
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,207
Alex's vibe

1051
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
Of the religiosity and endgame stuff

1052
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Really can't

1053
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
The show went on

1054
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
It started to make

1055
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
This first guy

1056
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
Fairly clear

1057
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
Why he's endgame

1058
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Why is getting back to it

1059
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
Because this gas

1060
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:03,199
He's somebody who is an expert in endgame

1061
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Type

1062
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,271
Narrative

1063
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Snow

1064
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,367
Rosa koire

1065
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,183
She wrote a book called behind the green mask

1066
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Agenda 21

1067
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,767
Channel 21

1068
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
Get her on the show now

1069
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Haha

1070
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
So

1071
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,143
She's on and they just talked about Jen

1072
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
121 and Highway

1073
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
Takeover plan

1074
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
It's a lot of a griffin

1075
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
And so I

1076
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Isolated Vista

1077
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,919
Got clip because I think it's won the most specific thing

1078
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Recess

1079
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
I think

1080
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
To this

1081
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
You can see what they're trying to attack

1082
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
When they attack

1083
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
AccuWeather

1084
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
They make accusations of Agenda 21

1085
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,607
You need to show up an occupied of government development

1086
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
Let them know that you know what it is economy

1087
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
Break that down

1088
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,087
So the argument is essentially

1089
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
This

1090
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Who is the u.s.

1091
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
Is that are under the eye

1092
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,375
Do you want to be local forces

1093
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:31,007
Plan is ecology, me and social Equity time

1094
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Things are involved

1095
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,687
Ecology equity

1096
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
Anytime you have a local thing

1097
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,063
And so you have to fight back against

1098
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,343
Involved

1099
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
The intersection of

1100
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,183
Economy ecology and social equity

1101
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
And if you do that what you do

1102
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,791
Not good stuff

1103
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,375
Automatically

1104
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
Things that you're again

1105
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,567
I proposed this Council that to we limit the ability of Coca-Cola to put pollution

1106
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
Okay well then I guess we can

1107
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
That's a perfect

1108
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
That is the utility

1109
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,999
This sort of argue

1110
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
And that's what you

1111
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Please bring to the table

1112
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,655
But I would spend a lot of time

1113
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
You should about Agenda 21 with this

1114
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
Rosa Corey

1115
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,287
She's up a group called The Democratic

1116
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,175
For a Democrat to hang out with a lot of right-wing

1117
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,735
Sing us a bulk of her media appearances that I can

1118
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,271
Can find her on Alex's show

1119
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
Hanging out with Glenn Beck

1120
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:52,159
And of course appearing on the overtly white nationalist show right Red Ice Radio

1121
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,487
Their particular complaints about Agenda 21

1122
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
Alex's in Roseville

1123
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Pretty boy

1124
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
Ramble about how it's the governor

1125
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
Let's plan to take over everybody

1126
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
I want to tell you a little bit about what you

1127
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
I need to know about

1128
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,567
First things first we discuss this matter in overtime to the Past

1129
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:14,687
Babadook

1130
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Chris called the Earth Summit

1131
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
Held in Rio de Janeiro

1132
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
June 3rd and 14

1133
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
1990

1134
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
Would have been funnier if they held it on the moon

1135
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
They would have

1136
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
Certainly

1137
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:29,791
Agrees implementation of

1138
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Parts of this

1139
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,351
Suggested sustainability measures

1140
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,143
Discussing the reporter entirely up to the

1141
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,679
Individual um

1142
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
There's no expectation to Country

1143
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
Saturday

1144
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Based on this report

1145
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,847
Is crucially important thing to understand

1146
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
How about this

1147
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
It was never

1148
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,479
Secret it was made public during its

1149
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Into secretly

1150
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,087
December 9th

1151
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,975
And that's the State of Affairs in the world were markedly different

1152
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
92

1153
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
Cold War attended there's a sense of hope surround

1154
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
In the future

1155
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Those poor dumb bastard

1156
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:12,031
The world was still dealing with the Fallout from the energy

1157
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Covid-19

1158
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
70s

1159
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
Illustrated

1160
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Problem with energy

1161
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,199
And that problem is going to be made worse

1162
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Developing

1163
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
To the world

1164
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,319
Strategies

1165
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,647
It would be unacceptable

1166
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,231
To say something like these countries aren't allowed to develop

1167
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
Industries of the realm

1168
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
They did they did it with the same Technologies

1169
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,447
Used the pollution overall damage to the environment would be

1170
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
Chesterfield

1171
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
You can't have fridges

1172
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
This was not an issue that

1173
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
Could be solved with unilateral decision

1174
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
A required everyone work

1175
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,479
Was needed

1176
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
And sustainable development became a topic of

1177
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Late 80s early 90s

1178
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,671
Alternatives to fossil fuels became more widely can

1179
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
A recycling

1180
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
The public

1181
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,351
It's in this setting that the Earth Summit was held

1182
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
And Agenda 21

1183
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:15,007
It's just a plan but the UN was encouraging smaller governmental bodies

1184
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
Create their own sister

1185
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
There were suggest

1186
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Alex

1187
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,199
Some kind of evil States

1188
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Because

1189
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
Treats private property rights as something

1190
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Be balanced with

1191
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Environmental issues

1192
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,879
Rural development issues and concerns

1193
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Indigenous people

1194
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
As opposed to how Alex

1195
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Seized property rights

1196
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,023
As the most important thing other than gun

1197
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
That Alex

1198
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
Has

1199
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,911
That problem

1200
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,471
People who have property

1201
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,615
Pretty I'm always interested to know what I would be like

1202
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
More than

1203
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
I don't even own two pairs of shoes

1204
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
I don't have proper

1205
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
No that's

1206
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,135
The Shoe Right Market

1207
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,463
This concern about the

1208
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
Or at least

1209
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:16,191
Conditional aspect of private property rights is a big part of Alex's problem with

1210
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
The agenda 20

1211
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Proposal

1212
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,775
Also the opposition

1213
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Involved

1214
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
They're opposed to anything that involves climate

1215
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Explain why a

1216
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
21 activist

1217
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
Show me hard right

1218
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,039
Nearest associated with roofs

1219
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
American policy

1220
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,855
City Center the Heritage Foundation

1221
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
John Birch Society

1222
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Eagle Forum

1223
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
But that doesn't

1224
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
White rose

1225
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Corey

1226
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Ostensibly a Democrat

1227
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Is also opposed

1228
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
To Agenda 21

1229
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
She's good friends

1230
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
Joe manchin

1231
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,215
Private property rights and the paranoia surrounding them

1232
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
Generally the exclusive territory of the right

1233
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
So if I'm just very

1234
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
Confusing

1235
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
There's one other group

1236
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
The super in the property rights

1237
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:02,271
You know I real killers you know what Cory's career was before she became a public Champion for agenda

1238
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:07,135
21

1239
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,463
She was a quick commercial real estate appraiser

1240
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Specializing

1241
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:20,191
Business of using eminent domain to dry for private use by commercial interest

1242
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,983
Direct opposition

1243
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
The government's parceling land

1244
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
Republic

1245
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
Which is an element of sustainable

1246
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
In what Public Works

1247
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
Excuse that she was involved in she said quote

1248
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,991
I was able to put together the players

1249
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,551
What was influencing restrictions

1250
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
It was related directly to agenda

1251
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
Sustainable development

1252
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
So she'd crack

1253
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,743
I wonder if the

1254
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
She is receiving a

1255
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
Further funding

1256
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
People who are

1257
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,679
I'm not entirely sure I couldn't find any strong

1258
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,471
Indications of that so I would be remiss

1259
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,567
Indication

1260
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:03,199
All the players involved

1261
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Solved the problem

1262
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
It seems

1263
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
Mostly she did that by creating two

1264
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
Deceptively named organizations

1265
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,415
You two look like legitimate neighborhood group

1266
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
But we're probably just

1267
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,255
She's literally a Russian troll

1268
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,863
Who started the Santa Rosa neighborhood coalition

1269
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,935
Begin agitated which is definitely not the same thing

1270
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
The very real Santa Rosa neighborhood alliance

1271
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Who's

1272
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
You said you believed that roses group

1273
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Carafe

1274
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
Inkay

1275
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:39,807
KB and Roses partner who is a general contractor

1276
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
Find work

1277
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,671
Coincidentally aligned interest

1278
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,487
Rosen K filed a frivolous lawsuit against

1279
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,791
Santa Rosa gateways Redevelopment

1280
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Which cost the taxpayers

1281
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
And delayed the plan for

1282
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
For three years

1283
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Bentley achieve nothing

1284
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
Other than that her strategies

1285
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,031
To be just to show up at local government planning meeting

1286
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
The disruptive

1287
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
That is intense

1288
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,663
Escoria said quote

1289
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
These public meetings are truly designed to stop you

1290
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
People from having an opportunity for input

1291
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,343
The only way to block a thing is to really shut down

1292
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,671
I really wish you hadn't gone

1293
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,695
Pro with

1294
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,743
Quit being a lunatic

1295
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,935
Council meeting should be stopped by somebody

1296
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Screaming

1297
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Conspiracy theory

1298
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
But not all

1299
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:36,895
Probably doesn't agree with you

1300
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,991
Probably inform Sarah.

1301
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
Corey is an embodiment of how deep

1302
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
Conspiracies are destructive in real life

1303
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Settings

1304
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,927
Opposition to anything that involves climate change

1305
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:54,047
Doesn't deify private property rights

1306
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
Has happened to the k

1307
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
Agenda 21

1308
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,727
Is grow up around the planned or anything

1309
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Is your city putting in a new park

1310
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,943
Agenda 21 is your city trying to put bike Lanes

1311
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,015
Framework of the conspiracy is accepted

1312
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,135
You saying that it's probably

1313
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
But even these people know they're talkin bullsh

1314
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:28,351
Outside of Infowars

1315
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,655
Behind

1316
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Program

1317
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
Agenda 21 vet

1318
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,751
Convinces them to do so

1319
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,287
Sure

1320
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,871
County Alabama on November 6th

1321
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,687
2012 all nine members of the planning and zoning

1322
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
In protest

1323
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,551
Weather comprehensive development plan

1324
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,391
It wasn't killed over budgetary concerns or anything like that

1325
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,207
It was a result of tons of people accusing their plan to be

1326
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
Too close to Agenda 21

1327
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,535
And protesting their meeting with

1328
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
The county needed to develop

1329
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
Cuz between 1990 and 2000

1330
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Increase in population

1331
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,495
42

1332
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Percent

1333
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,335
Quotes for popping up everywhere

1334
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
Little consideration given

1335
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
How many projects

1336
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
Would fit with

1337
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
Each other the environment

1338
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Future

1339
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
These nights

1340
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Problem

1341
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
And they were shouted conspirators

1342
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
These people

1343
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
AR

1344
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,023
Exactly how do we coexist

1345
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
With

1346
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Leggett there's got to be a way

1347
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
For us too

1348
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,727
Like you can still have your

1349
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
Not allowing you to influence

1350
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Maverick

1351
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Do we test

1352
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Like

1353
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,711
Dismantle Fox News

1354
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,527
No I don't think so I think

1355
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
I don't know

1356
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm obviously wrong but my answer always

1357
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
Just comes back to Greater education

1358
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,207
That's

1359
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,791
So anyway I

1360
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Text clip

1361
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
I would say that Corey

1362
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,215
Is cuz her last name

1363
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,775
Misspelled korir

1364
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,943
I keep forgetting how to pronounce it as I look at it

1365
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
Courrier

1366
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,039
She's expressing in this club song

1367
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
Expresses a lot

1368
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Real

1369
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
Salacious way of thinking

1370
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
It's the sort of idea that like

1371
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,743
People are attacking me therefore I am

1372
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,815
Is it dangerous

1373
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
Dangerous mentality

1374
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,935
We do have them on the run when you start

1375
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:46,335
That's what I know I'm winning Twitter actually out there talking about

1376
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,295
20 years you know you're winning

1377
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,855
Again it wasn't a secret like it wasn't

1378
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,135
Don't denied that it

1379
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,439
Exist your interpretation of

1380
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,767
And I will

1381
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
So f****** Danger

1382
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,911
Better give like I'm getting criticism that means I'm right

1383
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,959
Criticism

1384
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,239
You're terrible

1385
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,055
You can get criticism

1386
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,127
Or if you're getting criticism cuz you're creating

1387
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,431
Fake groups of concerned citizens

1388
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,479
I'm trying to bully

1389
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
City Council

1390
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
People say creating fake group

1391
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,391
And lying to people

1392
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
Disrupting canceled

1393
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
People say those are

1394
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
And that's how I

1395
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
I believe

1396
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,631
Probably the reason Alex's

1397
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
In his

1398
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,679
MD MedSpa

1399
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:50,079
Possibility in order to prepare for her being there

1400
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,919
Is homework on

1401
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,783
He does his homework on him so I don't remember what it is

1402
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
I don't want to read her book

1403
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:05,183
I'll just I'll just watch endgame and assume she said the same stuff I did also Alex

1404
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Just trying to sell his

1405
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Infowars magazine

1406
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
Something right

1407
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
And then he have another guest

1408
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
It comes in

1409
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Starts to give

1410
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
Understanding of why

1411
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
In the religion

1412
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
Really into

1413
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
To talkin about post

1414
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
Trib rapture

1415
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
Mr. t

1416
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
Exactly

1417
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,415
Intro

1418
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:51,519
It's because the leadership.

1419
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,295
The tribulation

1420
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:16,351
I'm not particularly interested in talking about what the Bible does or doesn't say because I feel like that's just going to work

1421
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,655
Send it to a

1422
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,895
He's also not recommended

1423
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
So

1424
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
Alex has gas

1425
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,647
Infowars.com

1426
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,631
Obama

1427
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
Steve Anderson

1428
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,335
Aggressively

1429
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,503
Remember

1430
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,063
Doing some biblical praying for Obama

1431
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
2

1432
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Brought down

1433
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
Houses of carbon that is really an Oculus

1434
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,487
People just pray for the president to be quote

1435
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,839
Brought down Pat Robertson or Jim Bakker do that everyday

1436
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,423
Probably

1437
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
You could describe as like

1438
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,543
You're not

1439
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Robertsons

1440
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
Second Amendment people to take

1441
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:11,295
Take care of Obama's a little bit too far

1442
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Steve Anderson

1443
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:17,183
In 2009 the day before Obama was scheduled to make an appearance

1444
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Clear exclamation

1445
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Heated Obama

1446
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
How do you spell that Obama could not be

1447
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Please save

1448
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,399
So praying for it was point

1449
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,287
Well then

1450
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Quote

1451
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,103
I'm not going to pray for his good

1452
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,407
I'm going to pray that he dies and goes to hell

1453
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,223
When I go to bed tonight that's how I'm going to pray

1454
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,807
The next day I Do by Christopher Brock

1455
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,367
Showed up with a loaded

1456
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,391
Obama's

1457
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,463
Which ultimately was probably more of a CR

1458
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
Anything else

1459
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Then a pastor

1460
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
Be free of a government

1461
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:00,959
Depressant

1462
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,519
This isn't praying for Obama's death from the pulpit

1463
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
One of the people who was

1464
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,871
In the congregation

1465
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,455
Speech showing up at Obama's speech the next day with a loaded weapon

1466
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
The PR stunt is a

1467
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Threat

1468
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,623
Exactly

1469
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
They were

1470
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
That's what they were doing

1471
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
And they did a good job

1472
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,511
I mean good job is

1473
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
A weird way to put it but yeah

1474
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,727
Incredibly homophobic

1475
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,687
Well he's the one who used to go on Alex's show but now hates them

1476
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,479
Boring

1477
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,599
We got a deep well if people to fall from their right

1478
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,647
A little fun update on Stevie

1479
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
First person ever to be banned from Ireland

1480
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:01,887
Good good for him I was just on the heels of a lens

1481
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
The last Americans band

1482
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,239
From the other ones were Richard Spencer and devout races

1483
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,055
Taylor Swift company

1484
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,871
These are just the 26 European countries that ban

1485
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
I plan to visit on a tour and they're like no

1486
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,559
Countries in South Africa

1487
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
As countries where that piece of s***

1488
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
Welcome

1489
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,263
We can get rid of him right when you remove his citizenship

1490
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
32

1491
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Within their borders

1492

YouTube YouTube channel

1495

Little fake hair

1499
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
Do not care

1500
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,471
Set a reminder

1501
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
Jason calixto

1502
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,919
Talking going for it talking about post-trib rapture

1503
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:22,527
Can you go back to this

1504
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:27,391
Exactly

1505
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:37,375
Yeah yeah yeah don't worry about it

1506
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
Pre-trib rapture globalist

1507
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Faricy Theory

1508

Barbarian

1509

Badabun

1510
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
That makes

1511
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,567
The least sense of anything I can

1512
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,943
No sense from a

1513
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,503
Liquid like from a strategy standpoint

1514
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,807
It makes no sense from a

1515
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,087
A goal

1516
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
He gets a call

1517
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
Who wants to talk about

1518
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
Carroll Quigley

1519
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
The book tragedy and Hope

1520
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
It whatever

1521
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,799
He just talks about a passage that I'm positive we talked about

1522
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,847
This before it's

1523
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
Completely misrepresented

1524
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
This caller is misrepresenting

1525
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,247
Quickly is talking about historically

1526
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
The difference between

1527
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
Arrows that are characterized by

1528
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,111
Complex and simple weather

1529
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,415
Embarrassing

1530
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Web

1531
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Ease-of-use for people like

1532
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Spears

1533
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,559
Or something along those lines

1534
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,887
Then you have a situation where power is much more

1535
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
Because people are able to fight with

1536
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
Each other have the weapons

1537
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
Together in

1538
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
Have conflicts

1539
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
A more specialized

1540
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
Becomes

1541
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
Power

1542
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,527
Can tend to become much more

1543
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
Concentrated

1544
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Alex

1545
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
Read that and think

1546
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Well

1547
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:07,231
That means I want to create specialized weapons in order to create

1548
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Consolidation

1549
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:12,095
And authoritarian power

1550
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,143
This is how history attended to go

1551
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,959
Yeah so anyway I don't really care too much about that

1552
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,519
But Alex do point out that he and his buddies

1553
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,103
Completely stole the intellectual property of Carroll Quigley

1554
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,575
Associated

1555
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,439
There were

1556
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,423
The caller from Australia called

1557
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,543
What's on the page

1558
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
Alex

1559
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
Personal private property

1560
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,943
Intellectual property

1561
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Pretty rights

1562
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:07,135
So I mean Carol Quickly's book only printed so many copies

1563
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,951
Scholarly texts

1564
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,327
The copy

1565
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
I wasn't

1566
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Demand for the

1567
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
So

1568
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,679
Alexandra Patriots

1569
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,471
Started reprint

1570
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,311
Is a direct violation of personal

1571
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,383
Believe their own principles what it comes

1572
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Some sort of wave they can

1573
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,711
Disseminate messages

1574
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
So

1575
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
Search for that wonderful

1576
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,975
The basement psychedelics cells

1577
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Got tragedy and Hope

1578
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,327
This is the fact that he thinks

1579
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,911
Carroll Quigley has admitted the entire Global is playing

1580
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
In this book

1581
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
All the time

1582
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
You might think that is red

1583
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Squid

1584
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,663
He shows himself to be like a college sophomore

1585
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Talking about inter

1586
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
Janet Jackson

1587
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:20,095
Illusion of choice

1588
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,359
Libertarianism

1589
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,943
In what possible world does an Alex Jones exist

1590
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,527
Hasn't read the entirety of a guy admitting

1591
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
The global plan

1592
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Alex Jones

1593
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
Can't possibly believe that this is

1594
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Sincerely

1595
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,463
Admission to the global plan

1596
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
Not make

1597
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,935
That's unacceptable it is the way everybody

1598
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
That's on except

1599
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,055
Because it you or me.

1600
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,127
Doesn't finish portrait of an Artist as a Young Man

1601
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,407
Whatever

1602
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,247
If you're a f****** person

1603
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
And you haven't finished it

1604
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,439
Go fuc yourself I'm like that undercuts

1605
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:23,839
Scholarly credit the subject matter

1606
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Expert on it

1607
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,423
You better Goddamn well it finished the book

1608
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,703
Because how could you not

1609
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
How could you not

1610
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
YouTube

1611
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:37,151
Do you remember Freddy multiple times 13

1612
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,943
It's like I'm not really into

1613
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,247
You know what I mean I'm glad I like I like James

1614
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Give me out on that

1615
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
That's a completely different area scholarship totally fine with that I'm not finding that person 10%

1616
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:58,143
Dollar Tree in the prescribed

1617
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,215
F***** up moment

1618
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
Obituary

1619
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,871
How dare he on I-96

1620
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,431
Yeah what are you going to do I had to go f******

1621
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:16,575
Yeah I assumed he had hearing him say it out loud is such a b

1622
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,903
I want you to lie to me quite

1623
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,791
Yeah we we coming to this with an agreement that you pretend to at least believe the b*******

1624
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,615
I know what other people have told me about it

1625
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:46,015
And I can make all the conclusions in the world that I want that I've read

1626
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:51,903
I know the people who are and I really don't think they've read it

1627
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,439
Have you bring really long

1628
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
I think he's probably read like six or seven

1629
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
Yeah that makes sense

1630
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:03,423
The relevant that are misrepresented

1631
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Yes

1632
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,359
Which is a big frog

1633
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,943
Yeah and the only person that we can guarantee is right it is skousen

1634
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,503
Because that's the only way I'm not.

1635
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
I'm not sure you read the whole thing

1636
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,623
Well the whole thing is long 1307

1637
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Maybe that's it

1638
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,327
So it is with Alex

1639
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Discusses like

1640
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,631
Okay so this call or called in

1641
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,655
He was talking about the

1642
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,703
Fun stuff in tragedy and Hope

1643
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,775
And Alex had a vague memory of

1644
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,711
Of that

1645
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:57,439
He says right here we don't want

1646
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,080
These

1647
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:18,688
Send stuff like a level of

1648
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,480
Quick recovery

1649
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
Of a memory

1650
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
I guess that

1651
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
Beginning of Wiz

1652
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:30,464
Right brevity is the soul of wit and of vague memory is the basis of wisdom

1653
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,280
Yeah that sounds right that's not good

1654
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,096
Overdrive

1655
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,240
The beginning of the show

1656
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,800
Because this guy brings up Carol quickly

1657
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,336
And Alex gets really excited

1658
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,128
To try and remember what

1659
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
What about

1660
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Yeah or at least gather his

1661
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,272
No into this post-trib rapture

1662
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
Souhegan

1663
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Steve just

1664
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
It's not Jerome corsi level

1665
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
It off quite well.

1666
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
Play The pre-trib Rapture

1667
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,912
Everybody of course

1668
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
Of course

1669
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
Episode

1670
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,240
Alex's Pizza

1671
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
You got to give it to all your pastor

1672
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,384
A word comes up

1673
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Become

1674
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,944
Sort of relevant to us recently

1675
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,528
Discern

1676
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
Black snakes

1677
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:04,416
Actually understand the Bible

1678
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:11,328
Well

1679
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
That's the

1680
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:21,312
Is discernment of coded word that we're not aware of

1681
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,664
We got discernment somehow I think there is a religious connotation

1682
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,200
Because I don't

1683
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,480
Necessarily think

1684
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,600
Use and when like Kevin Moore

1685
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:38,208
Or carry

1686
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
Sara Lee

1687
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
Similarly but there is a religious code

1688
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,400
For sure it is there is something something

1689
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:50,496
But discernment very very important for liar

1690
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,688
Really powerful and useful way to make

1691
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,736
Make people distrust their own intuition

1692
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:05,856
Because like you might have read the Bible and have your ideas

1693
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:10,464
Discern things

1694
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,280
Cred

1695
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
For your discernment

1696
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,376
Mcrad people to over

1697
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,448
Override their own

1698
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,240
Tuition Durham

1699
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
Perspective

1700
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,544
If I know better

1701
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
They have good dessert

1702
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,872
Eclipse

1703
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
And they are

1704
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Jumped

1705
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
Steve

1706
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,784
Weird things about

1707
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Bible

1708
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,088
The first

1709
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
About weapons

1710
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:52,960
He talks about every single

1711
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:59,360
And then also even Jesus Christ

1712
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
Alright everybody got swords

1713
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,256
82nd Amendment

1714
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Cool

1715
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
That

1716
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
Religion

1717
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
Government

1718
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,264
Prescribed by the Bible

1719
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,616
Romans 13 is really clear

1720
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:35,456
About what the purpose of government is

1721
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,552
Which is the punishment of

1722
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Exactly

1723
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,720
Exactly right

1724
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:52,864
Enforce the government

1725
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,008
To regulate Our Lives

1726
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Here's the problem with it as a Libertarian

1727
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
Based on principle

1728
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,928
If that guy is stupid

1729
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,720
Steven says God.

1730
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,024
Didn't say that the government can regulate Our Lives

1731
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,864
But how do you enforce the non-aggression principle without regulator

1732
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,448
We talked about it when we made fun of

1733
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
The idea of the non-aggression principle applied

1734
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,312
Universal

1735
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Involved

1736
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
Deep regulation of businesses

1737
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,152
In terms of pollution

1738
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Because

1739
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:42,016
You can't can't initiate you can initiate the second

1740
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
Smoke on people

1741
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Because that is in the Gresham

1742
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
You'd have to ask

1743
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,440
Completely regulate solution.

1744
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,976
So many aspects

1745
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
People's life

1746
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
You wouldn't be able to cars

1747
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,656
So a government that operated off that

1748
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
That God would be

1749
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
Involved

1750
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Intense

1751
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Regulation

1752
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
So that's kind of a little bit of vodka

1753
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
Which is like

1754
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Apply to Thai

1755
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,624
Post-trib rapture

1756
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,440
A Rapture stop and personally I don't really care about those are

1757
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
You know what I'm saying

1758
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,888
Post-trib rapture

1759
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,936
Comes from like

1760
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
Suggest that to just because you're personally.

1761
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
Rapture before the tribulation

1762
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,336
It doesn't mean that the natural conclusion is

1763
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,664
It's just not caring allowing evil system stakeholding heard everybody

1764
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
No I'm pretty sure that's

1765
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,784
What's morally cool with what God wants

1766
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,600
People work to feed the poor whose hunger they can't person

1767
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Feel

1768
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,952
So his idea that knowing the Rapture is coming means you shouldn't resist

1769
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,256
Simplistic and self-centered on its face

1770
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
I don't think that

1771
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,840
It's a accurately depicts what a lot of Christian

1772
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,608
Believe

1773
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,680
Is what motivates

1774
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Experience

1775
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
I believe there's a lot of people who

1776
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
The Rapture be pre-tribulation

1777
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,640
Would still alive

1778
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,176
It wouldn't change their

1779
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,200
Perspective Alex

1780
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
Very much narcissist

1781
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
It should just give you a sentence

1782
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
Reading colors on

1783
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,328
He talks about Australian guy

1784
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:35,168
Who wanted to bring up Carol

1785
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
But for the most part

1786
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
It's more like this

1787
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,104
For Alex to a call at the end of the show music is playing

1788
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:57,184
I just wanted to shake you God bless you

1789
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,768
Call Pastor Anderson

1790
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
That is a solid way to get a collar off of whatever it is they wanted to say a right onto like

1791
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:23,040
Yeah we'll see you next

1792
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
Yep

1793
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,648
This show is really upsetting to me

1794
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,464
Because there is

1795
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,744
Trend

1796
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,048
Bo of the religiosity and the end

1797
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Stop

1798
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
Each of these could be

1799
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
Explained by one of these

1800
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
Still doesn't make

1801
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
F******

1802
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
Different

1803
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,640
From January

1804
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
January 3rd

1805
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
January 29th

1806
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
It is

1807
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
Varied

1808
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:59,392
All the stuff you was talking about is been left aside there is no Piers Morgan talk

1809
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,952
Barely any Obama's the devil

1810
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,232
Maybe the devil

1811
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,792
Impeachment talk in the

1812
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,560
He's been focusing

1813
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,608
There's very little event

1814
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,888
They're going to take our guns

1815
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,192
This is one of the

1816
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,264
I think this has happened at least once maybe

1817
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
Two or three time

1818
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Every

1819
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
We've done where it's been like

1820
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,408
Okay well this episode

1821
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,688
For some reason

1822
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,992
Parked in between this long string of b*******

1823
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,552
Is Evergreen you have no idea what

1824
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:33,952
Evergreen

1825
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Exist

1826
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Weirdly

1827
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
Detached from the

1828
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,584
This rounded contacts

1829
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,424
Satisfying for me on many levels because

1830
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,728
I want to understand

1831
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
2013

1832
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,592
I think it just shows us

1833
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
Has these ideas that have been

1834
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
They are forever

1835
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
Inspirations of his inability or unwillingness

1836
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
To do any kind of research

1837
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Topix

1838
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Claims to be Expo

1839
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,352
The no King

1840
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Claiming it comes from

1841
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,168
The revolution

1842
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,728
American Revolution John Adams

1843
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Absolutely not

1844
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,360
He's just accepted quote-unquote

1845
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Patriot lure

1846
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
About it

1847
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:30,016
He has not read Carol quickly book by his own admission he's tried and failed to read

1848
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
To be an expert

1849
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Dr. Eric

1850
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,672
Pianca he claims he looked into his live show but it's f***

1851
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:40,000
But he's talking about. A pile of Rwandan

1852
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,048
This is b*******

1853
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,376
Even if it is a bottle episode we get

1854
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Nothingness

1855
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
Sara Lee in terms of

1856
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,984
The grander picture of his Sandy Hook

1857
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,776
It's still worth it

1858
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,616
Memphis's of his ability

1859
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
Yeah this is just been a long string

1860
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
The hymn

1861
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
Just really not knowing

1862
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
Anyting

1863
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:07,904
George Jefferson

1864
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,000
Set timer

1865
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
I do feel that way about

1866
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:26,080
Website

1867
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:30,944
Go to bed we are also on the iTunes

1868
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,040
Which I guess will no longer be something that were on anymore

1869
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,832
Since it won't exist very shortly

1870
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,136
Apple podcast

1871
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,952
I don't know dude

1872
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
I don't know

1873
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:48,096
Alright fine I'll get on Spotify

1874
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,936
Just come to the end

1875
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
And I would say

1876
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
Eric Pianka

1877
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
You killed anybody

1878
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:01,920
AmeriPride

1879
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,736
Little bit of

1880
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,016
Sensational speaker

1881
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
Prone to

1882
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,600
Skeletor's ranking

1883
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,136
Pretty cranky

1884
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,440
I appreciate that

1885
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,048
Probably has

1886
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,264
Alex
