1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
They're like a hook

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
Is there a reason you would listen to to Yahoo's talk about Alex Jones

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
That we are stuck

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:31,488
No there's not that

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
That's all I can do that

8
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,520
And it's turning out that now at 3:11

9
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
Does it

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,896
Peanut in it

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Hexohm

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,992
Still going wrong

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
It's great song

14
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Amber

15
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,256
If you like couple of there so it's not going to do it I don't want to wreck my brain trying to come up with 311 songs are okay

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Jordan soy before I believe we made the Declaration that I'm just sticking in the past

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,336
March 23rd 2008

18
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Before we do

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
From Today Show

20
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
Okay this is going to be a weird

21
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Radio show that you're not going

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
You want to miss

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Alright

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Selling it up top

25
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
But I'm learning very interesting

26
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
Is that

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
In 2008

28
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
Alex Jones radio show

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
It would not like a regular radio she was not a production

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
You didn't have a lot going for him and so like nowadays whenever he wants a day off or something like

31
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:56,224
Now maybe do a half-day

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Tekken couldn't do that

33
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
He doesn't have that he doesn't have

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
No so what he would do

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
If you would replay interviews from a couple days previous

36
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
And make it

37
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Like its lie

38
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,608
Yeah because I was listening to

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
No

40
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,104
Cuz I was listening to like the 20th or something like that March 20th

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Dr. Dina Dell comes back

42
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
And I'm like

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Call Jack Brown

44
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Broadcast which is even crazier

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,840
I'm listening to remember a bit of this

46
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
And there's a couple days where it's

47
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Just a no-man's-land of nothing

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
That's that's

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Butt stuff

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
So

51
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
I think it's the whole thing the whole thing is just rebroadcast

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Together interviews from previous days

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Diabolical

54
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Yeah I think that's what a lot of radio shows do though a lot of them will announce like I'm going to be off for a few days

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
The best robot ever

56
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
No he does not

57
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,216
What's going on

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
I'm a policy wonk

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Thanks so much for joining up with the show

60
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,176
Also like to give a shout out

61
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
I'm a policy wonk

62
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,784
Don't get mad and tell your brother

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
Appreciate it so much

64
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,464
If you like to come if you want

65
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
Mark I want

66
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048

1

68
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Do we know where Gina Del is now

69
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Yeah I think he's retired and it's Dean is the first name yet

70
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't know can we commissioned him we can email him

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
Email him

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
To call in and record him

73
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Giving

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Steve pieczenik

75
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
That's what I want I want I want every

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
Character on Alex Jones Show to record

77
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Those exact

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,399
Just go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
23rd of March

80
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
2008

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Easter

82
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
I think it's

83
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
I think they are the special going on I know because he doesn't have enough selling product

84
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
Stay in my salesman

85
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
Which actually gives the show an entirely different feeling

86
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,535
Rick the fact that he's not throwing to commercial all the f****** time

87
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
It feels totally different

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
I can't you're so excited

89
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I am and I'm not

90
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Exciting to me that this is something new in the sense that we haven't had to deal with that for like 4 months

91
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,831
The I know everything about Alex Jones you know nothing about it holds

92
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
True it's kind of boring for me

93
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
Listening to him being like I know what he's doing

94
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Now it's like

95
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,583
This is crazy

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Kind of crazy but

97
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Is it just him

98
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
Like he doesn't have co-host she doesn't have Rob do hanging around in the studio

99
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
David

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
I think David Knight might be around at this point but just doing the Nightly News

101
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
News back then as well

102
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
I know Paul Joseph Watson

103
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,927
Is around because he referenced having him right article

104
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
But I don't know if you've gotten him to be on-air Talent yet

105
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Infowars.com is still around

106
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
A planet.com

107
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
Happy most of the commercials like I said on the last episode of our essential he was all for his documentaries

108
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
They're all just like

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
He plays the sound bite of

110
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,991
George h.w. Bush

111
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Well

112
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
You'll see immediately Easter

113
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,791
And also I should say

114
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
Way worse on this Sunday show

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Because he's broadcasting out of a

116
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Studio

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Has much better sound

118
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Where is this broadcasting from

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
This is the KLBJ Studios

120
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
Austin Texas after three days he will emerge from

121
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
I guess so

122
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for inviting us it is discharge

123
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
When we worship

124
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Fertility

125
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Set my Playboy symbol

126
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Rabbit

127
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Rabbits

128
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
How many cycles

129
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,551
Each year their breeding like rabbits

130
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
That's why

131
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Pixel rabbit

132
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
Has the symbol for his Playboy

133
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Empire

134
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
And so

135
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,071
In the last 60 years our children have been trying to not be Christian

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Ion

137
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
I am bid for hundreds of years

138
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Has been called Easter the occult symbolism

139
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
Hidden in plain view the Eastern My Worship

140
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Ishtar the mother

141
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Goddess

142
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Fertility the eggs

143
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
The rabbit

144
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
And it is a huge fertility ritual

145
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
We just had the beginning of

146
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Bring

147
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
A couple days ago and then we shall liberate

148
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Lehigh occult

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
The holy that was object

150
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Nicole branch

151
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Just all over the world

152
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
From the Aztecs

153
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Shot to the Babylonians

154
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
Of course to The Druids now going

155
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Nobody's doing

156
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
He's just

157
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
Repeating zeitgeist

158
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
I want to hear him explain more

159
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Did we get that you know

160
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Banging like rabbits

161
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Because rabbits

162
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
Have sex a lot famously like throw the baby out with

163
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Time somebody threw a baby out with the bathwater

164
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Play has bunnies

165
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
But I'm almost certain that's why

166
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
That's not correct at all that is not correct

167
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
Hugh Hefner was thinking he was like okay

168
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
First of all it's not a call

169
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
Boogeyman

170
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
Easter in Latin is known as

171
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Aramaic word

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Hebrew name pesach

173
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Which is you know

174
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
That's over by also the Easter doesn't come

175
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
From Ishtar it just sound similar

176
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Wake up.

177
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
This is something it's been a whole bunch

178
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
The the name Easter traces

179
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
Most likely

180
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Absolutely

181
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
It's something that's very

182
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Commonly thought again

183
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
Goddess of fertility

184
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
In the same way if it like Greek goddesses would have

185
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Multiple purposes

186
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:54,687
She also is a goddess who is a lion

187
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
I guess not a bunny or eggs at all that's all just made up s*** that's not true

188
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
In the least

189
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487

00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
The bunny rabbit of the catwalk make a decent point

Do dogs butts

203
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Be the most accepted theory about the name

205
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703

Which is actually a whole lot more

211
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
The issue is like okay

212
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Alex

213
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
What he wants to say

214
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Is

215
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
There's Pagan ship

216
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Behind Holiday

217
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
You just say that

218
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
But if you want to play this game

219
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,967
I know all of this but you guys are actually

220
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015

Strong

226
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
Lot of bitterness in that little story

227
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
A little bit

228
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
He's wrong and continues to be wrong

229
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
And the kids have fun with the eggs

230
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
They do

231
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
The whole point is is that I don't worship Ishtar because I'm conscious of it

232
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
And I realized what it is

233
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
What's a globalist

234
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Enjoy

235
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159

237
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
They enjoy having things hidden in

238
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
In Plainview

239
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303

240
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Aluminess religions they get

241
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
CorePower

Out of things

243
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Things being in Plainview and you still not

244
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
That's all part of

245
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
The basic crazing

246
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Look up

247
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383

Different cultures they differ

255
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Would engage in different

256
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Sacrifices

257
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Sometimes it goes

258
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863

Sometimes a bowl

260
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Sometimes a horse

261
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
But there's a normal blood pressure

262
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
If you talk to her then there was obviously

263
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639

381
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
The culture and then is Amplified by the culture

382
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Troll

383
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
The peer pressure

384
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Monkey Nexus Overdrive

385
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,111
Is that what we term I just climbed there but that's basically what it it

386
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Nonna's

387
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,791
Go to popularly known as and then whatever was he and then he's like

388
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
The hundredth monkey Nexus Overdrive

389
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
Even the coin term he just came up with this stupid

390
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,919
How many reasons is that

391
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Absolutely

392
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
It's clunky

393
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Too wordy

394
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
I kind of agree with him that the idea of all cars having

395
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Killswitch is

396
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Not good

397
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Necessarily

398
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
But I also see the practical application of it

399
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
I mean

400
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
I don't know that one's murky

401
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,287
No I mean it's an interesting idea because

402
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Car chases

403
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,919
Like my cousin

404
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
Hit by a

405
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Running away car

406
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Chased by the cops

407
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
And no never caught the guy

408
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,487
Time an old person behind the wheel run through a crowd

409
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
There are

410
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,119
Terrorist attacks that used cars now as a cheap to be happening in Europe every now and again

411
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
So you're is a practical application

412
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
The only problem is now you're talkin

413
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Sing about a remote kill switch

414
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
And as we know about any kind of remote

415
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Technology

416
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
It's going to get hacked

417
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
Somebody who knows how to use it better than you do

418
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
It's entirely possible

419
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Negative

420
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
This point already

421
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Kind of stupid

422
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
But at the same time

423
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
He's also very

424
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Bluebird about how smart

425
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
Write the noise

426
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
It's not bad

427
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
You know it's annoying but it's not it's not

428
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Alex Jones

429
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,455
To get out right now is the Muslims put kill switches

430
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,551
Then we're talking Alex

431
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
Is it like

432
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Three things so far

433
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
It'll come up

434
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,327
We've got Ishtar being Easter which is not whatever

435
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,215
You want to get into your esoteric babbling about weird internet memes and s*** like that

436
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Fine

437
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Good fun

438
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,919
Good on you there is a segment of the population is because of Ishtar

439
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,991
I'm I'm susceptible

440
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,111
Like I watch videos on YouTube

441
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
And I wouldn't want someone

442
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,536
Just because it's not true to not put it out there I love it I'm fine with that

443
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
Then we have

444
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,704
The government is going to put shock bracelets on you in order to fly and then we have

445
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Kill switches

446
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Cars

447
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Are like their paranoia narrative

448
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
But at the same time

449
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
The way he presenting them and the position he's in in 2008

450
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Is the kind of guy who I'm cool with exist

451
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
Because

452
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
The absence of that

453
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Voice is worse

454
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
But you know the government's

455
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,072
Our organizations tend to overstep their bounds

456
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Their hundred percent of the time pushing

457
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
B powered

458
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Just naturally does

459
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
It so having someone who is

460
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,592
About like

461
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
He's kind of a value to it

462
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
I agree

463
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
Because the absence of that voice

464
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Allow

465
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
Something to be unchecked

466
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
To some extent

467
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:22,208
I think I think they're smarter voices that do it but possibly not more popular

468
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,560
Are granted his positions rrl alarmist and paranoid

469
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
And not based in reality

470
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
I'm not saying he's right

471
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
But what I'm saying is the this point it's

472
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
At least

473
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
Let me make it worse as yet

474
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Episode goes along but like

475
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
He's not as offenses

476
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Izzy is it like

477
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
6 years later

478
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Right

479
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
I mean yeah he's he sounds more like

480
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,880
The guy on the corner with with the sign saying beds

481
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Apocalipsis

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Yeah

483
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,328
Yeah I like that I like that available to me like if I'm walking down the street

484
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Thinking about whether or not the

485
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
Bright like to be reminded that it is

486
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
Regards

487
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,616
We know from the last episodes it's like being mean there is still bigotry going on he's still

488
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:16,736
That's still part of him

489
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
So you just didn't know he also hated it

490
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,904
I'm conflicted about the position he's in in 2008

491
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
In terms of like

492
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,024
If you could get rid of the racism would he be a valuable voice

493
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
In public discourse

494
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
I know

495
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
I'm not sure

496
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,936
There's a better argument for it then then there is now that's

497
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
For damn sure

498
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
Anyway I don't know that that's just a thought that I

499
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
I've had

500
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
I don't know what to do with

501
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Anyway

502
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
That's all we're having is

503
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
Is Alex Jones better or worse

504
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Now way worse

505
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,880
But I think it's worse for him to

506
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Anyway

507
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
Listen to this next clip

508
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
And that way he brings those sort of narrative

509
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Together

510
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Alright

511
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
Welcome ladies and gentlemen it discharges remember

512
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
Do they start favorite song

513

Purple green and

514
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Pink

515
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Easter eggs

516
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
And hopping around

517
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Fell asleep 50 years ago and I just now woke up on a cryo freezing

518
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
Turned on the news and they were proposing it we all walk around

519
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Weren't shock bracelet

520
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
I feel more relaxed in the entire public be fitted with

521
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Photoshop price

522
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Oh yeah

523
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
Definitely Al-Qaeda because

524
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
Cuz I don't want to wear mine

525
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
What's good

Cement blocks keymaster good

527
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Everything

528
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Is fine

529
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
My friends

530
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Alex loves doing radio

531
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Keith

532
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,352
So much happier 10 years ago

533
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
Edit do something to me okay I'll be

534
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Just lay all my cards on the table

535
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Are you want this Alex

536
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
To come back

537
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Identify with

538
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
You take away the racism and stuff like that and that's the life I f****** want it for a long

539
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Long time

540
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:31,392
Just being able to talk on a talk show like I have your own f****** radio show and really love it

541
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Like I can feel it

542
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
I can

543
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Feel his enjoyment of this radio show

544
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,608
And it bums me out the path we know the next decade takes in his life

545
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
Story of capitalism

546
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
We need to have

547
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
A FurReal

548
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Crisp

549
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
Was Carol situation going on

550
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
Yeah the ghost of decay

551
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Jakari Jax

552
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Sandhill go see what it was like whenever he knew a black

553
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Those were the days

554
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
Larry Elder might still talk

555
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
I will take him to the DC office

556
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
This now and he'll realize how boring Jerome corsi is

557
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
Of course you get a f****** hotel room

558
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
It'll be hard

559
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:34,368
What is an Alex

560
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Could get back together with his first wife

561
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
I don't know if that's a good

562
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
I'm going to go

563
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
He'll get back together with one of his 150 high school sweetheart that could be

564
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
And maybe maybe I'm willing to

565
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:52,032
Except that there is a part of me saying like he is

566
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
He is a

567
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
Terrible voice

568
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
In the media landscape

569
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Because

570
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
Identify with

571
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
Having your own Radio Show in Lake Highway

572
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
Siding that looks like

573
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Ethernet cable

574
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
It's possible

575
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Time like

576
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,912
I don't know I'm coming out of my mouth I realize I can't I can't

577
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Kinda like a

578
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
I can't

579
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
He's still basically saying

580
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,176
All government is evil you should be afraid of everything which is really the Bedrock

581
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
What makes my problem

582
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
So do f*** that you're saying right now like with Alex because he enjoys having

583
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:43,744
Radio show like that's a very different thing that I like his voice being available to anybody

584
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
It's it's really difficult

585
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,912
To walk because a certain amount of paranoia is used

586
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
Too much paranoia is dangerous

587
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Having a paranoid voice around

588
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Is

589
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,664
It is good to check some of the underlying assumption

590
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
That we have

591
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,016
You know you're saying he's not the Overton window

592
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
Not know

593
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
No

594
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,928
More towards paranoia but not all the way

595
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Know what I'm saying is back then

596
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
There is a there is a purpose and

597
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
Society videos fulfilling to some degree which is being

598
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Like you said that crazy voice

599
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,240
That guy who yells stuff and like maybe one time out of 50 is right

600
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,104
But they put because of how crazy it is it causes you to take a step back

601
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Re-examine your

602
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
He's not that now

603
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
But going back and listening to this like

604
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Same guy doing

605
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Something very different back then

606
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
I guess maybe it sort of

607
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
Growing Pains or shock

608
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:52,352
Of jumping back in time that I've experienced in this

609
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:58,752
I think that's just because the bar is set so low

610
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
He needs to be arrested killed now

611
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
Are you just going to get people to believe dumb stuff

612
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
X-rays of relatively benign character underlying racism

613
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
More fears of various

614
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
If you look at what was going on on like Fox News in 2008 it's really not that different

615
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
It's no different than libertarian or conservative

616
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Just stocking trade

617
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,104
I don't know I'm having a very

618
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
It's not something that we want to

619
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Yada yada yada over

620
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,784
No absolutely not I don't think it's good

621
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
That means in terms of what we talked about

622
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Alex

623
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Far worse than that.

624
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
I can trade stuff now

625
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,816
Sandy Hook and all that stuff

626
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:01,216
Not 2000 like Timothy McVeigh

627
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,824
Yet I haven't really heard him talk about it much

628
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
Very complicated it might just be because of e doesn't

629
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
But listenership

630
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,000
That makes up his race is horrible

631
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
These shows

632
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't see how

633
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
He ever got

634
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Popular

635
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,776
From what I've listened so far does yellow stuff every now and again but it's not like

636
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,688
Like his voice right now he's got that little upturned at the end of it is

637
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,040
It's interesting to think of the trajectory of like

638
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,392
This being 10 years ago and we know that he go the only goes up

639
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
Right gets to like this

640
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,024
I mean is it a plateau now

641
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
He's going to crash

642
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,424
Very Hearts what are the things that forced in my mind is it like that growth is not organic

643
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Play can we listen to that

644
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
Bill 15-minute interview we had with all of his narrative

645
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
Why you got to be careful

646
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,248
Statistics you got to read other studies

647
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
Conjunction with the studies that you're trying to

648
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
And I don't understand how anybody listening

649
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
To his show

650
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Think like

651
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,888
His own positions are being undermined on his show

652
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
Yeah but never underestimate the

653
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,824
Absolute hatred that a lot of Americans have for anybody who knows fancy learning

654
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Yeah that's true

655
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,152
Anti-intellectualism does go a long way

656
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
Alex Jones junior varsity

657
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Narrative of the show

658
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
It's about your blood

659
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
I don't want our blood

660
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Department of Homeland Security

661
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
I want to spend some time on

662
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
You all of your children

663
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,680
35 or younger you've been putting an illegal International database

664
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
All of now

665
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Your conditioning

666
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
36 years old

667
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
I know that I'm going to read the actual document

668
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
This is real

669
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
Blood they say go to the health department for a blood test

670
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Did you ever ask why

671
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Why the hospital can do a blood test

672
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Your blood publicly went to

673
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Federal database

674
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
International

675
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
Okay for DNA testing

676
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
DNA background

677
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,304
They claim they own their child's blood they make DNA patent

678
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Who's out of it

679
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
New proteins and things

680
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
But now

681
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
It goes to Homeland Security in the National Crime database

682
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
Wood murderer

683
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Bank robbers everything else

684
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
Celebrities too much paranoia paranoia

685
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
One of the reasons that your ospital doesn't

686
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
It's kind of expensive to have that kind of

687
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,240
Issues and the ACLU in particular is working and has worked

688
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Towards

689
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:55,200
In terms of blood from your baby and you get screen for all sorts of diseases

690
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Because some of them

691
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,856
Are things that can be dealt with very easily immediately

692
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,416
Will be under on reversible later

693
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
So it's very important

694
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
The genetic condition

695
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
To do that sort of thing

696
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
But the issue has become the

697
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
The information

698
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
From

699
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Store

700
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Depending on the state

701
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Furlong

702
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Periods of time

703
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay that's great

704
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
The test can be done in

705
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
In terms of

706
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Incredibly valuable

707
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
In terms of

708
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,392
Correlations in order to track.

709
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
Dreams for other Jeanette

710
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Conditions

711
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Things like that

712
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
No lot of the time that information

713
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Yeah it's on identifier

714
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
Has all the identifiers taken

715
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
What's your name is

716
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Connected to it

717
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
Or anything like that very weird

718
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Terms of consent and privacy

719
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
And the ACLU is working

720
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
And has been for years

721
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
Trying to like

722
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Allow people to

723
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
I have the right

724
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
In terms of invasive

725
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
And that sort of thing which is

726
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
How much more

727
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
Well there's there's the story of the the black woman

728
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Blood and genetics

729
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,256
Material that was cultured again

730
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Again for like

731
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,888
60 years or something like that and it's one of the most important

732
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Samples

733
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
Medical research history

734
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,264
But I've never told her about it

735
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
We only found out that

736
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
It happens

737
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Like recently in the pack

738
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
And it was all done like

739
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Hey we just stole your stuff and now it's

740
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,296
Copyrighted in Patanol that said I'm not sure if

741
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,416
Driver but they just stole her information and used it

742
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Willy-nilly

743
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,536
But I don't want to

744
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
From

745
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,680
And the B wait what I don't want to minimize it but like what was she going to do with it

746
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,240
You know what I mean

747
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
I don't I don't think

748
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
It's great to be

749
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Blind

750
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,920
Depressed but at the same time

751
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,224
You right to be blindly paranoid about

752
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Yeah because there are

753
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,600
Credible medical advances that were probably made by users woman

754
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Yeah but I like Isaac

755
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
I think it's a licensing fee

756
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Right

757
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
Feeling use your blood

758
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Bellingham Herald

759
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
I would say give him a license

760
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
They can have my blood out

761
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Alright I'm not using it

762
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,824
We're going to be like 15 damn timers

763
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,456
Maybe great awesome podcast

764
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Loving Network

765
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,624
I was reading up on this propaganda

766
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
There's an article in Newsweek

767
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
From 24

768
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,864
How's read you here sooner than average with serious Shadow dies

769
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
1036

770
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
Has worked as a filmmaker 4 / 2

771
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
10 years

772
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:01,568
He's traveled throughout Europe in the Americas producing sports videos news packages and documentary shorts

773
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Ressentiment

774
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
He was diagnosed with a rare genetic

775
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Condition commonly referred to as

776
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,760
KU where the body cannot properly break down

777
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,344
Throughout his life he's taking medicine involved special low protein

778
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Diet restrictions

779
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
Enjoy the healthy life

780
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
Recently though he stumbled across the

781
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
This video that showed people with undiagnosed

782
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
UK you

783
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,144
Well you heard stories about what would happen if you never treated his condition

784
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,984
I never seen pictures of it I've never encountered it myself

785
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
So it wasn't quite Realty

786
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
You says

787
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,360
I want to watch that video he Trails off choconut deposit

788
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Until the Heartbreak pass

789
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
It just captured me

790
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,016
I have the sudden realization that I would have become mentally retarded

791
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
I would have

792
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
The tution had it not been for

793
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Newborns

794
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
And that story is true for

795
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Thousands

796
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Thousands of

797
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,536
People every year with PKU but with all sorts

798
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Two conditions

799
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Curate their life

800
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
It would be nicer to it like I said

801
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Things are treatable

802
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
And manageable

803
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Initially

804
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,080
But later will not be you can't go back

805
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
Write this screening stuff is absolutely essential

806
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,272
Yeah but it's preventative medicine

807
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
He hates vaccines

808
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
Going to see the doctor you should

809
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Just buy like bulshit pills like

810
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
He despises any kind of

811
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
Actual

812
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Solution

813
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,144
By every account newborn screening is one of my day

814
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,936
Biggest medical success story

815
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,776
That's what I would say

816
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,896
23andMe

817
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:46,272
That company were you send a swab in and they tell you your genetic history

818
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,416
020

819
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Here

820
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,400
23andMe consumer genetics company will genotype your DNA and provide you with a 3 related reports in a raw data

821
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
Previously 23andMe reports

822
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
Ratios for certain Medical

823
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,104
In November 2013 the FDA prohibited the company from

824
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
Continuing to sell Health Report

825
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,968
Isaiah. Could not be analytically or clinically validated

826
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
In reality a health

827
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
Report may just be the most in

828
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
Enticing carrot 23andMe was able to dream up

829
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
In order to get your DNA in it

830
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
It's computers

831
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,512
As noted by the authors of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine

832
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
Quote 23andMe has suggested that it's longer-range goal is

833
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
List of collective massive biobag of genetic

834
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Information

835
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
They can be used and sold for medical research

836
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,520
It could also lead to patentable Discovery

837
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
This characterization is not denied by

838
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
23andMe

839
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
This characterization is not

840
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,784
Denied by 23andMe

841
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
Accelerated genetics

842
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Discovery

843
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,928
F****** amazing

844
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,072
The real money then isn't selling you a health analysis using selling your data for biomedical

845
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
It's not much difference

846
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,216
How Google Yahoo and Facebook give us email and social networking for free

847
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,312
Only to sell all the information they gather to anyone wishing to market products to us

848
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
23andMe is already conducted research

849
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Funded by the NIH

850
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
And collaborated with academic and Industry partners

851
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,064
The company offers customers who buy Personal genetic reports

852
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,880
The option to participate in this wider research program

853
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,464
Currently 23andMe stores data from more than 700,000

854
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,840
Genotype customers more than 80% have not only opted into the research program

855
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
But it also actively answer survey question

856
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Here's here's where comes down

857
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
The way it does

858
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,568
The way information becomes really valuable is when we can start

859
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,384
Look at genetic information and also understand phenotypic

860
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Big Data

861
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Explain the company representative

862
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Research looks something like this

863
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,344
After first isolating all the customers who have stated on a survey that they have a particular allergy

864
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Erasers

865
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,976
Might run a query to see if these customers share some genetic mutation

866
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,048
It would further analysis find out where those variants are located

867
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Quote

868
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,144
Those are the things we want to explore 23andMe

869
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
But we can only do that if you answer question

870
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,056
Predict your participation in biomedical research then really has two parts

871
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,640
Consenting to use your genetic data and providing your personal information to

872
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
The value of the data

873
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
So

874
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,320
If you look at that just from a consumer model that's a 23andMe

875
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
That's what

876
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
These bio Bank

877
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,488
The information that comes from the babies

878
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Are going into

879
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
Same sort of thing they're tricking people

880
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Chances are

881
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
They were just sending out

882
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Random generator

883
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,384
Right I don't know I don't know that they can't do that anymore is because

884
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
We can't

885
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:01,087
We don't know if we can confirm this so you could be lying I think it was random they probably would be sued

886
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,903
Because that would be the sort of thing

887
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,463
Because that's what you would have to do it come up

888
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
That would come up

889
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
An audit

890
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
Or something like that

891
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
If the FDA is telling them not to

892
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
To do it anymore they probably looked

893
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Into what they're doing

894
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
I would assume

895
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
Because the idea that

896
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
You can't back this up

897
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
They would have an opportunity

898
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
That would be a conversation

899
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Yeah

900
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
That's what I'm saying so

901
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
That's because it's like a random ass thing

902
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Same thing is like

903
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
Giving a horoscope

904
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,071
Pretty much either of us can prove it

905
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Next point

906
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Neither of us can prove any

907
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Fair enough

908
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,519
Keeping in telling your genetic information

909
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
You're giving up all of that in

910
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
Information to them keeping a keeping it and selling it to you

911
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
Towards

912
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
Breakthroughs in science

913
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
They can be

914
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
Used to possibly

915
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:07,647
Isolate where these allergies come from a table to make it so people don't have to suffer with those allergies

916
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,463
Is anymore allergic to liquid

917
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
I know somebody was allergic to Sun

918
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,167
You know like there are really crippling allergies and if there were some sort of breakthrough that could be made

919
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,543
I think there's a lot of people whose lives could be greatly benefited from it probably

920
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
Now that's a super good offices

921
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Able to be sold to

922
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Do anybody though

923
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,599
It's in their f****** small print people are paying to use their service so

924
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,671
I don't think these people have any leg to stand on

925
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,999
I was looking for it I can't really find any abuses

926
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,399
Like I can't find instances of abuses of this genetic information flus

927
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,239
You think that's because of the whatever

928
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
Is if I was going to use a database

929
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
To genetically engineer a

930
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
Strain of the flu

931
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
That could kill 90% of the population

932
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Call 23andMe

933
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
This flu season did not kill.

934
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
I'm positive test run

935
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Could be killed

936
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,327
Dry run

937
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
I know Alex has

938
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,447
Again the Cradle of something that's like there is a privacy issue

939
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,031
Little more responsible bodies like

940
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
I've been aware of an active

941
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,383
Yes

942
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,943
He's paranoid

943
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Ignore the more important and

944
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Socially

945
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
And medically important

946
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
That seems to be sort of a runner

947
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Yeah

948
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:49,023
Yeah I mean I don't have too much what would they do with like Ikea

949
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Information

950
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,215
Copyright your jeans like I own your body

951
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
Or something like that

952
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,799
Think so

953
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Courtney

954
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
I don't know I don't know exactly what the fear is he

955
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
He's never really super specific on it

956
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Let's go to the textbook

957
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Cuz it's what you might down

958
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Another delightful mama

959
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
In 2008

960
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
Alex Jones

961
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
Out in the west Texas town

962
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:48,159
The police demanding drug test me I refused so they tasered me five times

963
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
Basalt

964
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,423
It's so much fun oh please

965
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
Feed me more

966
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,967
Wild America Wild and Free

967
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
Face scanning cameras everywhere everything to do track

968
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
My town

969
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,407
But I wasn't allowed to own a gun in America anymore

970
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
And I wasn't allowed to

971
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
To fight either

972
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
The kids aren't allowed

973
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
Now they're banning

974
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Running

975
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
During recess again everything

976
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Risen

977
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Great

978
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,351
So that was Marty Robbins El Paso musical comedians

979
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Who are

980
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Jealous right now

981
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,735
Improv Musical

982
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783

983
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Still

984
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
Kaiser things the wrong song over another Zone

985
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:32,095
It's nice that he takes time out of every episode 2 mi of Empire

986
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,959
He wasn't doing entire country song every episode

987
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Who is the life

988
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,127
I think everyone knows that because of the penultimate episode of Breaking Bad

989
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
Teachers at 2

990
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Great song

991
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
El Paso Marty Robbins

992
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
AutoZone

993
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,975
Mischaracterization stories

994
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Which is fun

995
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
I gave that woman

996
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
I've been a little bit

997
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
Too generous to Alex throughout

998
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
The show perhaps already

999
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,919
Get to now Wyatt

I'm we sold out for helicopter

1005
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Just flying

1006
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,767
Like it's real close to ground

1007
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
Backup

1008
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
Call on the highway

1009
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,447
Highway 76

1010
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,751
Big lot of cops

1011
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
Operation

1012
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
That's good

1013
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Giving you safe

1014
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:52,735
But if you say you don't like what they were doing that they don't exist but you say you appreciated one of the police state they do exist

1015
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Saladworks

1016
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
You got to learn how to work or do you have a

1017
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
As long as

1018
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Around mine

1019
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
They're winning

1020
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
And they're on top of

1021
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
They are

1022
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Is that

1023
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
The analogy is Somaya

1024
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
Business is falling apart

1025
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Oh that I might competition

1026
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
Deep trouble

1027
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
You want to answer

1028
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Certainly.

1029
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
What

1030
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
Hey we went up

1031
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,575
What's a candidate there were four helicopters in the police operation

1032
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,391
Go to town Alex tell me what was going on

1033
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Give me a conspiracy theory and I was just like

1034
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Nope

1035
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
No cuz I have excuses for me

1036
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
Alex is using it in service of a bigger

1037
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
Conspiracy theory at Matt is that like you're not supposed to worry about that stuff

1038
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
First second but those believers

1039
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
If you believe

1040
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,591
Probably just there doing

1041
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,919
I'm sort of a routine

1042
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Is waiting

1043
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Other

1044
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Hilarious

1045
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
The next clip

1046
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Just like

1047
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,823
You're an idiot if you believe anything is

1048
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Nautica

1049
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Conspiracy

1050
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,943
And that's a really dangerous mentality for him

1051
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
I like I sounded Young

1052
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
The caller sounded Young

1053
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
We went up to Canada with

1054
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
Is Dad all right

1055
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,391
High School

1056
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Can you speak

1057
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Two people

1058
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
You should not

1059
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
You shouldn't reinforced the worst parts

1060
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
Of there

1061
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
Their mentality

1062
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
I think he's doing

1063
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Wizkid man

1064
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Because of stuff like that

1065
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
I get my but my car and I drive down to the studios of Newsradio 590 KLBJ

1066
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
Can we check into the satellites

1067
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
FM dial

1068
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,887
Communities across this country

Travel cast on the internet for way worldwide we're not giving up

1070

00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,895
The New World Order scientific dictatorship

1072
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
The robber baron

1073
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
Valium Cisco

1074
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Ladies and gentlemen

1075
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:01,407
Afraid they try to dumb you down

1076
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
Turn you into a bunch of nerd and understand the world really works but you're starting to wake up

1077
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,855
Feel the freedom again

1078
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
And you're starting to wake up

1079
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,183
Big brother doesn't like that

1080
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Play pop in there

1081
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
That's right

1082
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
We're back live

1083
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
High School football speech

1084
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:25,471
I have ever heard my tire life

1085
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
They're moving over today Weird Al coach Taylor get out of the way closed hearts

1086
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Cantler's

1087
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,319
So f****** into this

1088
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,647
I love it I love it

1089
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
There isn't like

1090
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,279
You know when someone likes what they're doing and it's infection

1091
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,167
Minute-and-a-half how much he loves his job

1092
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,543
Nobility

1093
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,943
Shuffle

1094
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,991
Stuff is soaked like it's all not true

1095
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
Man the passion is

1096
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Oh yeah

1097
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,415
RadioShack

1098
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
I do not like

1099
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
The others

1100
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
I don't like the other stuff about like

1101
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
Those moments

1102
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
I think what I'm getting at is

1103
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
I want I just don't want to be a nerd

1104
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
I want to rap

1105
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,135
I want to admit wrapping up the show but I want to wrap up my feelings from earlier I think

1106
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
We have empathy with human empathy

1107
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
To our detriment

1108
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
Where I say it like

1109
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,423
Alex is much better than

1110
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
Probably comes

1111
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
A place where I can

1112
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
Feel him

1113
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Being

1114
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Yeah

1115
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
I can feel him

1116
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,407
Even if you thinks all this stupid government

1117
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
Paranoia fear

1118
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
All this stuff even if he thinks all of that's real

1119
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,575
His place in life is right

1120
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
This is where he belongs

1121
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
That's a really good point

1122
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,767
The worst thing that ever happened to him is whatever artificial

1123
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
Success he had

1124
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,327
At some point after this

1125
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
Because he's lost his way

1126
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
He lost his soul entirely

1127
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
It probably has

1128
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,495
Much less to do with Trump than we think

1129
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Play cuz it's probably

1130
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Before that

1131
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,871
Even like his stuff from like

1132
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,919
2013

1133
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,735
2014 he wasn't on the Trump bandwagon

1134
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
He's still like not as happy as he is there or when he's listening to Highwayman

1135
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
New plan to

1136
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
To fix

1137
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
Alex Jones

1138
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:59,071
I don't think it can be done but I think I know where you're going but I don't think

1139
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
We get him

1140
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
To coach

1141
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
A little league hockey

1142
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,215
A little

1143
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,151
He'll fall in love with Anna realize that that's not the woman

1144
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,991
For him to get a cutout of George do exactly

1145
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
Conspiracy theory

1146
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,839
Alex gets really blow Hardy about history and religion and

1147
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
Even use the same

1148
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Quad Squad together

1149
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
So I can make

1150
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Judgment about a culture

1151
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Metrobank

1152
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
Degenerate

1153
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,151
And the Aztec culture was.

1154
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
And very satanic I'm not to go down there

1155
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
Thousands of

1156
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Skulls

1157
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Walls

1158
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Hellraiser

1159
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Like hell

1160
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Majestic Power Trip

1161
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,975
Priests whacked out of their mind on drugs

1162
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,047
Meet

1163
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
For the pub

1164
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
The General Public

1165
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Sacrifices

1166
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
Is that a couple sacrifices every day even the smaller

1167
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Nope

1168
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Call centers around villages

1169
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
Nope all around

1170
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
Central City

1171
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,335
Where they got their orders

1172
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,639
And they would kick the dead bodies of the people

1173
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Play chakra

1174
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Everyday

1175
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
Sundown in the people would get select

1176
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Makeup

1177
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
In fact you got the look

1178
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
Sub priest-class with hanging up

1179
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Father feet

1180
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,647
Cut-ups

1181
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,719
Does price

1182
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
And cellulite Lester. I don't think

1183
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,351
Until the main

1184
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
Meet

1185
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
It was out of the children

1186
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
So I

1187
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
Apologist on the subjective

1188
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
Just let me know

1189
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,175
Just worshipped Ishtar bunny

1190
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
I want to know.

1191
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Just be ignorant

1192
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Just March

1193
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Google

1194
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
Google

1195
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,999
Human sacrifice

1196
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
Ester cultures is actually really fascinating

1197
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
First of all that happen monthly there is a like 80

1198
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,519
Gmod calendar that the Aztecs operated under and they'd have different

1199
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
Sacrifices of a dude

1200
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
Pacific Theaters

1201
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,455
Sacrifice

1202
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
Is actually really into

1203
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
Christine as well

1204
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
Generally speaking with the Aztecs believe

1205
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Was

1206
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,719
That their gods who came

1207
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
Before sacrifice

1208
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Themselves that

1209
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
Humans might live

1210
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
That was a foundational aspect of Aztec

1211
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Believes

1212
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:46,751
Christianity sacrifices we would live without sin

1213
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
It's not uncommon in religious

1214
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
Traditions Christians are just less hardcore

1215
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
They weren't always

1216
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
That's true

1217
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
That's a good point but

1218
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
The people who were being sacked

1219
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,831
Generally speaking were very willing

1220
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,135
Fencing at because they understood their role

1221
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,695
In the the drama the cosmo

1222
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,719
Drama that was being

1223
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
Anthropologie

1224
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Just to study they find it

1225
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
Three almost unbelievable the people were forced into

1226
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
The sacrifice

1227
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,679
Most of the time

1228
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,519
They couldn't really have been

1229
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
Because so much went along with being attacked

1230
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
Sacrifice like you had to leave

1231
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Procession

1232
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
Beaches

1233
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
Have people sing songs

1234
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,735
Go and talk to people

1235
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
Like there was a really ritualistic

1236
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,575
Part of being the sacrifice

1237
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,927
Right into this idea first of all they were doing it multiple times a day is

1238
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,231
Absurd

1239
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Except

1240
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
In an instant

1241
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
Like christening Duty

1242
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Temples 2

1243
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
Then it would be like

1244
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,775
They're very reports on it but like

1245
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
People who

1246
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
You really study to come away from

1247
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,479
Spaniard propaganda

1248
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
Spanish who came in in Concord

1249
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
They needed

1250
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:08,159
To justify a lot of their atrocities the way they did

1251
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:13,791
By their actions a lot of time with you like they killed 80,000 people trying to

1252
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,143
Krishna Temple

1253
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,983
Which is a lot of people

1254
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
Festival Foods

1255
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
You know it's spread out a little bit

1256
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
Organize

1257
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,639
Right

1258
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
The infrastructure

1259
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
For being able to kill thousand

1260
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,479
The people in one

1261
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
Enough

1262
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
A few days

1263
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
That's right

1264
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
That's a lot

1265
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,391
It's a well-oiled machine

1266
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,183
How many how many how many

1267
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,719
Our

1268
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,375
I've never asked the question how many sacrifices can you do per hour but now I want to know

1269
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,215
Propaganda argument that's just what I'm

1270
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
I'm choosing to call it

1271
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
Cuz a lot of people have suggested that it is

1272
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:01,919
Was it over the the Great Pyramid of temperature

1273
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:07,551
In 1487 when it was built that they sacrifice 80400 people in 4 days

1274
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
U14 sacrifices of minutes

1275
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
For the 4 days

1276
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,951
Which is

1277
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,975
Generally speaking

1278
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,767
Pretty unbelievable

1279
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,583
The real number is

1280
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
From people who have like

1281
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Critically is

1282
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,959
Baby 10001

1283
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,311
And then I old Aztecs to talk to missionaries told of a much lower figure

1284
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,359
Probably about 4,000

1285
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
Which is still a lot

1286
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,967
But it's part of their religious cosmology

1287
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,879
I don't know enough to fully break a lot of his stuff down but from looking into it

1288
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
The role of sacrifice of human

1289
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
In their culture was

1290
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Fascinator

1291
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,303
Play doubt Wars

1292
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
Between different Aztec cities

1293
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,143
Where do the goal of the war

1294
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
Was not to kill each other

1295
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
It was to injure someone bring them back

1296
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
To be sacrificed

1297
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
And the people who were on both sides

1298
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,383
That was their rule were they to be injured

1299
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,711
It was like playing out a drama through Warfare

1300
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,039
Where you were actually trained in Warfare at like

1301
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
Target practice

1302
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,415
Yeah but then also you know you know sacrifice

1303
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,231
I'm head with a rock you're probably going back in

1304
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Taking to the top

1305
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,815
It's it's fascinating stuff

1306
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,143
I looked into it and I realized that

1307
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,703
Is not the inspiration 24 Flag Day

1308
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,775
Know the false cognate

1309
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,199
Other cultures are fascinating and looking at them through solely the prism of our own culture is

1310
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,551
It's a definite way to end up hating other cultures

1311
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Things are worse than you

1312
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,879
Saudi cannibalism affect

1313
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
What's cannibalism

1314
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,487
I like the way that he described because he was like

1315
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,815
You get sacrificed and then they kick you all day

1316
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,119
And then do the cricket down the steps

1317
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,191
You repeatedly all day

1318
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,239
Call Daddy

1319
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,639
I don't think they would hand out the me like what he was describing is that beat

1320
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
Because of the kicker

1321
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
You'll get really

1322
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
Hinder human

1323
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
You down the temple stairs

1324
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
That's what that's

1325
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
He said all day though

1326
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
Sacrifices all day

1327
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Whatever

1328
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
The issue isn't like

1329
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
Early

1330
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,215
Anthropologists thought that because of the

1331
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,263
Ecology and the

1332
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:40,127
Where the Aztec cities were located that they wouldn't have had a ready source

1333
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
The protein

1334
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Emmet Sullivan

1335
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,991
Sacrificing people was away too

1336
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,527
Create a source of protein

1337
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,111
Later Studies have shown that that

1338
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,975
Yeah because there were plenty of plenty of

1339
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
Sources

1340
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,559
Protein

1341
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Lizard

1342
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,375
Weasels

1343
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
Salamanders fowl

1344
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
There's all sorts of birds

1345
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:08,287
Amazing other other crops

1346
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,079
They could feed their carbohydrate needs

1347
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,407
Theory of human being

1348
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Protein

1349
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Is not not accurate

1350
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Don't get me wrong

1351
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
Some people take it eat

1352
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
5

1353
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
People

1354
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
Sometimes you're going to get eaten

1355
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,415
But

1356
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:30,303
If it was bit like this big societal need and everyone was clamoring for human flashing would have you

1357
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
It doesn't make sense that they would then

1358
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:37,727
Take a lot of the organs that would be the best eaten and sacrifice those to the Gods

1359
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
You know what I mean like

1360
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Illinois

1361
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,687
What's the new rumor Crystal Lake

1362
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Okay

1363
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,527
I'm fine and they sacrifice the choices cut

1364
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
The tastiest giblet

1365
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
From here on

1366
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Alex

1367
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Freedom

1368
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
I would say

1369
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,399
Holidays

1370
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,703
What starts off on one topic

1371
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,263
And jumps to this is another reason why I think

1372
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
Loves doing radio known being able to tell him what

1373
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,127
To do this make any goddamn sense

1374
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,407
In this clip

1375
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Use ghost

1376
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
One topic

1377
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
Max the max

1378
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
Mexico it's a show

1379
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
It's real simple Christianity was

1380
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Oppressed dominated

1381
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
Attacked several hundred years

1382
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Never cries

1383
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,743
Then a Roman Emperor decided to adopted

1384
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
Wouldn't go away

1385
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
And so they hid

1386
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Everything

1387
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,191
Basically in plain view in all of the Saints

1388
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
Holidays

1389
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
When they celebrated

1390
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
Christ's birthday

1391
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
You know that's

1392
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103
Middle of the winter the dark

1393
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
The winner

1394
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,687
Just a way of

1395
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
Like looking at

1396
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,039
Probable reality from the other side

1397
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
You could say that those

1398
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:02,463
Pagan symbols and Pagan figures already existed in Constantine took over in the

1399
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Early

1400
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
So like 3:30 maybe was that when he became a Flipagram

1401
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,983
Christianity you took the pre-existing things and relabeled them

1402
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
In Christian

1403
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,335
Populace is together

1404
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
You're trying to run

1405
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
Empire

1406
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
Isn't on there because it's like

1407
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
A massive

1408
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,039
Government is telling you what religion

1409
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,439
To to follow you should be on the Pagan side

1410
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,231
Me what God to worship

1411
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
When it starts in

1412
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Getting wider app

1413
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
After that

1414
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Celebrate going

1415
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Cheyenne

1416
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
To the winner out of the

1417
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
Fall I mean they have all the

1418
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
They're all on

1419
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
Kia cult day

1420
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
It's all over Europe

1421
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,103
All of them

1422
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,151
Again riding to Asia

1423
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,199
You looking at this backwards

1424
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
They hide them

1425
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
In Plainview

1426
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
Fertility symbol

1427
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,879
Symbol for tin star

1428
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,439
The Babylonian goddess of

1429
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Infertility

1430
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Was worship all over

1431
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
River names

1432
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Every culture has

1433
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
Freak

1434
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
Christianity stop

1435
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
Churches with big balls

1436
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
That is the male phallus

1437
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
The Martian Monument theater

1438
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
Is a giant mailman

1439
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
Cat scale

1440
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
Women's breasts

1441
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:27,967
Dick

1442
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,527
The doorways into them I'm not going to go any further

1443
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,087
This is mainstream Architects by pussies

1444
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
Temple priestesses

1445
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,487
Are the Washington Monument or of the text

1446
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
For the goddess

1447
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
On top of

1448
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
Of the Texas Capitol

1449
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
They're very point-blank

1450
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,495
The match because predating

1451
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
Christianity

1452
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
A Judaism

1453
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
Under solemn

1454
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
The son of King David

1455
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
Do you know what that is extra

1456
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,295
Most powerful in a cult black magic

1457
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
That is the most powerful symbol

1458
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
If you read the old test

1459
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
The genie

1460
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
The demon back in the bottle

1461
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
And so he

1462
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Tapped

1463
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,095
Total control over devils

1464
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Real or not

1465
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,935
So the Star of David is

1466
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
Black magic

1467
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Shalimar

1468
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,687
Nothing you've been told is what it really is so

1469
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:35,807
They openly call Eastern boys yours you run around talking

1470
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
King about

1471
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
Jesus

1472
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
Play walking around animals

1473
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
It's three months off from

1474
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
He was actually Chris

1475
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:50,143
Does down for a long time to get them to like why does the sun look red when you look at it it's Josh.

1476
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,543
It's dust it's a lens effect it looks shut up Alex

1477
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,615
Ramblin from topic to topic

1478
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,479
Whatever it is just what you think of that moment that you're wrong about it

1479
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,623
Jesus being crucified

1480
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,927
It's just another guy named Jesus

1481
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,743
Crucified

1482
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:21,631
They Crucified a lot of people that he's referring to from the histories of like juicy fifth

1483
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
The other historians from back then

1484
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Is not the Jesus

1485
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
That

1486
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,287
Christianity

1487
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,359
It was a it was not a singular name

1488
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:35,455
Well they're talking about it

1489
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,271
Jezebel

1490
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,551
From what I understand

1491
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
Religious studies professor

1492
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
Not not my dad

1493
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:48,511
Historical Jesus

1494
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Conflated

1495
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
The one that Alex is referencing

1496
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Who got

1497
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,215
And there was a rabbi

1498
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,799
Slightly different time periods don't quite match up perfectly

1499
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
Do all the sayings are attributed

1500
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,919
Historic history and especially

1501
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
You know what I hear especially Paul

1502
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Paul is pretty

1503
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
Particularly guilty of this because he

1504
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
Was the one who wrote all those goddamn letters

1505
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
Corinth

1506
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,719
That Bass

1507
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,279
His his work

1508
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,559
Probably had a lot to do with

1509
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Complacent

1510
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
So I don't know

1511
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:30,239
But whatever else is talking about isn't accurate is a prince and the Pauper

1512
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,383
That is already what do you mean why would you have a hippie rabbi

1513
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
Why would that come about

1514
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
No way would that happen then

1515
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,343
Through a lot of them

1516
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:50,463
Who is walking around Navy met this other guy named Jesus they looked a lot alike

1517
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Twins

1518
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,255
They were twins

1519
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
Jesus had a secret twin

1520
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Okay

1521
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
Switch clothes

1522
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
And live out their lives

1523
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
And it turns out

1524
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
This is a real morality

1525
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,543
Okay

1526
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,847
If he didn't have his robe

1527
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,871
He would have just been

1528
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Criminal

1529
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
And that's what he became

1530
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Okay and the Jesus

1531
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,759
If he

1532
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
He would have been Jesus

1533
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
This makes perfect

1534
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,903
That makes total sense

1535
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,719
Finally got

1536
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
To the bottom of the G

1537
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:29,375
All you need to do is add an explanation for why

1538
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,447
I was going to switch to a King Ralph butt

1539
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,591
Goddess worship

1540
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,687
Just be aware of it I'm not saying you're going to hell if you put out

1541
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
And the occultist

1542
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,135
They openly laugh about it

1543
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
Say look at all these

1544
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
It's out here

1545
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Practitioners of

1546
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Dragnet

1547
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
Where the Tom Hank

1548
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
And Dan Aykroyd

1549
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,679
Notice

1550
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,983
The local preachers actually devil worshiper

1551
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,007
That's how it

1552
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
It works

1553
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
The cops the drug dealer

1554
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
The big mega church pastor

1555
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
He's the hyper

1556
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,271
Locally generally

1557
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
And that's just how it works

1558
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,695
Dragon fruit

1559
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:31,071
Are you saying that you have a big

1560
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
Church what is that

1561
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
Oh that's a big dick

1562
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
You're all in there and it

1563
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
That means

1564
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Jose

1565
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
Patriarchal

1566
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Religion

1567
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:50,271
Hooked askew

1568
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:54,879
About oppressing

1569
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:00,767
It's kind of a weird esoteric

1570
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,559
Anna Anna

1571
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,375
Goddess worship

1572
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Remixon

1573
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,799
Domicile

1574
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,615
Otherwise rhetoric Secret

1575
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,943
Wherever you find a war memorial at a capital or anywhere else

1576
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Look around you

1577
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,551
The 5000 dead

1578
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,111
Cavalry Battalion of whatever

1579
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
From Civil War

1580
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
Stop

1581
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
And look around you

1582
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,535
You you will see within 100 yd

1583
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
Up on top

1584
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Pillar BB

1585
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
And she'll have her hand

1586
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Towards the Sun

1587
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
We're in or vice versa

1588
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,591
You're driving along and you see a goddess on top of the

1589
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Impeller

1590
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Are you sure

1591
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
Capital r

1592
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919
UCO University

1593
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
Go in

1594
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
Within about a

1595
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
100° in front of

1596
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Also

1597
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,207
I bought a courtyard courtroom

1598
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,231
Still have like

1599
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,255
Lady Liberty

1600
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,583
You know there's a goddess

1601
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,631
In the courtroom because he demands in just

1602
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:18,335
That's nonsense in the world

1603
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,663
Football field

1604
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
Square footage

1605
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,295
Think about it

1606
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,391
So dumb

1607
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
Places that there are memorials a probably graveyard

1608
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
Some sort of Big Mama

1609
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,119
The idea that there would be some sort of

1610
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
That's right in line

1611
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
It's not

1612
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,615
It does not ring of like some esoteric order

1613
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
But that's alright

1614
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Generally straight

1615
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
It will be a shocker

1616
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
They will put a

1617
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
Memorial in front of her

1618
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
She needs blood

1619
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,047
Answer the practitioners

1620
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,375
They had to be secretive about

1621
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
Are mystery cults

1622
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
And there's a star called

1623
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,471
The rest of it

1624
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,263
Shoved are there

1625
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
You load your coach

1626
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Colts

1627
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,383
Remember even ABC News admits that the bushes worship

1628
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Eulogio

1629
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Goddess

1630
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
At

1631
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Robert

1632
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,415
And this is just what I did

1633
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
To your question

1634
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
You haven't

1635
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:44,095
What would that have been the answer of a question

1636
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
I remember what the caller asked

1637
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,751
What can I put on eggs

1638
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,335
The beginning of the eclipse you said you're not going to hell if you put out eggs

1639
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,383
What question

1640
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,943
Could it be answered with

1641
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,991
Worship the goddess

1642
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,039
That sounds right

1643
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,391
Do you know about the Greek goddess eulogia

1644
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
No

1645
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:12,255
You couldn't cuz she doesn't exist

1646
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
Well that's what happened

1647
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,519
Neither do wmds

1648
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,383
Must be

1649
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,759
The code is created by

1650
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
Creative mythology around themselves

1651
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,111
They first started

1652
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,159
Yeah it's very dumb

1653
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,255
Look into the beginning of the skull and bones and More You Realize like it

1654
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
It's a lot of dudes

1655
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,071
Into another frat and then they started

1656
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,607
Something really weird

1657
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
It's gaudy

1658
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
What is it

1659
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:57,567
Anytime weird repressed White

1660
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:03,455
Lego

1661
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:08,831
Your Amway for racist lyrics

1662
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,183
Baker Alec breaking into Bohemian Grove

1663
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,975
Repressed old white dude

1664
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,511
Getting weird with a

1665
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,815
A showpiece play in the middle of the Woods

1666
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
I don't know I'm not sure exactly what kind of identify with

1667
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
You probably get bored

1668
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:31,359
That that's sort of pageantry probably I can spices

1669
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:35,967
No maybe go do some stuff in the woods for a little bit

1670
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,295
Probably much less mysterious than we

1671
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,647
Are our brains like to make it up to bone

1672
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,695
All of that stuff like about

1673
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Jacking off

1674
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,279
10 coffins and stuff not true

1675
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
Or if it is it's just a weird dude jerking off

1676
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:58,239
And more likely than the reality is

1677
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,287
F****** dudes back in like the 1800

1678
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
Couldn't get into other prestigious

1679
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,407
Frats and orders

1680
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
Was it Yale

1681
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
I think probably cares

1682
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,623
Weird and their problems

1683
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
Is it a like

1684
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,927
Do something

1685
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:23,327
That's stuff they watch they read a little bit

1686
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,935
Not the Good Ship

1687
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,823
Anyways

1688
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
Anyway

1689
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Is it snowing

1690
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
Because this this show is not like

1691
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,575
He just talked about it start

1692
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
Can't beat that drum

1693
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,743
I'm too hard but you said something towards the end of the show and this is how we exit

1694
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,791
And I have a lot to say about it

1695
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
Is it

1696
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
There's a lot of problem

1697
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Just like our government

1698
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Serbs

1699
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
On the starting spot Back Bay

1700
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Gus Robert

1701
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
Search

1702
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
You know the history

1703
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Report on that

1704
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,383
I want explain this again you very very slowly

1705
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,943
Are criminal government

1706
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,735
Created Al-Qaeda they use them to attack

1707
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Servicenow

1708
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,087
That is enough for criminal media

1709
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Corporate controlled media

1710
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
They them come out

1711
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,255
That Iran is funding Al-Qaeda

1712
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
And that Iran was behind 9/11

1713
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,607
That Iran is attacking Iraq with Al-Qaeda

1714
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,447
Group War with

1715
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
CIA and I'll tied up

1716
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,311
Now I'm not saying they're good all governments are evil

1717
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,127
The point is Al-Qaeda

1718
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,175
Is run by our Criminal

1719
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,455
That insurance

1720
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
It's all documented my film

1721
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,575
Prisonplanet.com

1722
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
Centurions the show

1723
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:59,071
It's only with 9/11 was an inside job

1724
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,631
It's not

1725
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,679
Also

1726
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
Right but his films are also not

1727
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
Accurate

1728
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,455
I want to say is first that mentality of like all governments are bad is really I think

1729
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,807
Motivating Alex stuff

1730
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,111
He's really an anti-government guy

1731
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,415
And it's weird that now

1732
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Pro

1733
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,207
Trumpian governor

1734
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,047
Really sums him up in terms

1735
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,679
Except inasmuch as that Libertarians want almost

1736
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
No government

1737
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
Buy highest

1738
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,799
Highest Authority in the land of the local

1739
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Absolutely

1740
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:48,479
That's just the true facts Al-Qaeda being used to start things off

1741
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,015
And I in Serbia

1742
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:54,623
Recently booked

1743
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,647
It's called

1744
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,463
The trigger hunting the Assassin who brought the world to war

1745
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:06,911
Franz Ferdinand

1746
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:13,824
The reality is in the nineties there was an Islamic faction from out of Cu

1747
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
The country called

1748
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,944
In Bosnia

1749
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,528
Presenting this is really f***** up

1750
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:27,904
I'm just going to read to you a passage here from this book that I read reasoning

1751
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:35,072
Is from Bosnia we're highly secretive during the war but while I was researching the book I made a breakthrough by tracking down one of the

1752
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Before in Muslim Fighters

1753
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,912
A few miles from my hometown

1754
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
Shahid but was just two years older than me boards Birmingham to parents originally from Pakistan

1755
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:49,920
Working as a reporter I'd first seen him in a yemeni court in 1999 after he had been arrested

1756
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,480
Can charge the terrorist activities committed an FM

1757
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,808
His brummie accent being memorably out-of-place

1758
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
The far edge of Arabia

1759
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,976
That would be it would be more than a decade before I was able to sit down and talk to him about Bosnia a cake shake

1760
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,768
Cake shops Irving Arabic tea

1761
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,816
The pastries in a Birmingham suburb with a

1762
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
A particularly strong

1763
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
Islamic

1764
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:12,448
Quote the thing you have to remember is that when I was growing up in Britain

1765
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,264
Nationality

1766
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,872
This is a time when the streets around my home would have walls painted with ATL

1767
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
Huge letters

1768
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Packy Lee

1769
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,808
And all through my teenage years people like me were being abused in the streets getting beaten up

1770
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,856
Having dog set on us that sort of thing

1771
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
Back then just leaving your front door to get you in trouble

1772
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
When I'm at school all I wanted to do is serve as a filter

1773
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,048
I wanted to be a royal Marine right

1774
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
It was a time of the Falklands War

1775
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,168
The best all over the talion in the papers

1776
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,240
I went to recruitment office and asked to join the Royal Marines

1777
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
You know what they told me

1778
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,336
They said we cannot have you because you're a fat pack

1779
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
So do you know what I did for the next year

1780
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,224
I ran around the streets near my home in boots with a rucksack for the brick

1781
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,064
I went back to the recruitment office 12 months later and asked to join the Royal Marines

1782
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,112
And again this time you know what they said

1783
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,928
Well you're not a fat Paki anymore but you're still a pack

1784
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,744
In the early nineties I started to attend boss

1785
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
For some of the first radical clerics were beginning to preach

1786
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,864
It was around this time in the war in Bosnia began

1787
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,192
You watched video cuz that's showing Bosnian Muslims victims of the war

1788
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
It's very confusing to begin with

1789
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,520
Stevie's Muslims

1790
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
Blue eyes and blonde hair

1791
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,872
It was not like anything I've seen before traumatic

1792
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Overwhelming

1793
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:28,224
Just to learn the people were suffering like this just because their mother

1794
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,832
He joined an aid Convoy arranged through his local lost that sent out to coaches

1795
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
From Britain

1796
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
Supplies

1797
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
Intended for Bob

1798
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
With a plan to bring back Refuge

1799
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,792
Chaos is the vehicle got no further than Zagreb in Croatia

1800
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,816
I was unable to cross

1801
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,096
The border into the war zone

1802
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
Quote there were these guys

1803
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
To wear eyewear Metro organized

1804
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,264
You said you were going to do one thing and you end up doing another

1805
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
We fell out it was useless

1806
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:57,664
So after some prayer I joined up with a guy from London

1807
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
Driving to baz

1808
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
I never been out of Birmingham

1809
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,272
And there I was all of a sudden towards

1810
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,064
We gave out the food

1811
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,880
There were lines and lines of people and they took it all

1812
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
And that's where it came into my head

1813
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,464
The media likes to say a Muslim like

1814
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,280
Meiomi fights because we're some kind of crazed psychotic

1815
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
It was not like that

1816
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,120
I went to Bosnia to bring humanitarian help

1817
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:21,728
What other humanitarian help could I give up

1818
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Protecting them

1819
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,568
These people cannot protect themselves and that's how I could help

1820
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
I would fight

1821
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
My mate with the van went crazy

1822
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:34,016
It's not like it is in the films he said are you for real how are you going to fight you don't know anyone here and you don't have any weapon

1823
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
He went on and on trying to talk me out of it but I made up my mind

1824
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,648
I wrote a letter to my wife what you took with him

1825
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
And then he was often

1826
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,744
Is van in the morning

1827
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
The sun still Rising

1828
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Next to the road

1829
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,816
The town called track

1830
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
The mujahideen forces

1831
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,336
So you most mostly restraining in training.

1832
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,664
I don't want to say I was here or anyting but the times I took Park

1833
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
Attacks with a really heavy

1834
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,504
Yeah guys on either side of me getting hit

1835
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
That sort of thing

1836
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,576
I saw myself as a traditional

1837
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,880
I was a fighter sure but I was fighting to help

1838
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
The oppressor

1839
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,184
To protect them against

1840
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
It was a noble a

1841
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,000
I want that I would do again

1842
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,328
These guys are takepart and suicide attacks they're not true mujahideen

1843
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,400
They're killing innocent people that makes no sense at all

1844
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
From any point of view

1845
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,216
It makes no sense from a religious point

1846
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,008
As it's not part of my religion

1847
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,568
And it makes no sense from a military point of view

1848
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,592
The Strategic perspective

1849
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,944
How are you going to win the hearts and minds of people to kill people who are not involved

1850
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:39,296
Bosnia's role in the evolution of modern Jihad has largely been overlooked

1851
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,368
Example of what

1852
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,416
From the anger of young people is ignored

1853
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
Western politicians

1854
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
Who stood by when the worst atrocity

1855
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
Lease of the Bosnian War

1856
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
Replace ethnic cleansing

1857
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
Death camps genocide

1858
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
Inadvertently provided Islamic militant

1859
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,448
And cry they would later use to just

1860
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,472
Stuff I act of Terror

1861
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,592
Yeah there's there's another there's another path

1862
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,896
I really short one that I think really

1863
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
It sums up some

1864
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,992
Stuff that I just want to grab here real quick

1865
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,576
This is a quote from another guy

1866
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,880
He was traveling with the author

1867
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,904
Temperature

1868
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
Jim Butcher

1869
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,232
Interpreter

1870
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,352
He's describing what they ended up experiencing cuz he lived through the

1871
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
He was a Serbian Muslim

1872
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,288
Who were

1873
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
Difficulties

1874
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
In terms of

1875
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,128
The croat the Muslim

1876
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
There's a lot of

1877
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,968
Complication in terms of what

1878
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
Caused

1879
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:41,504
After the worst

1880
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,808
Parts of the Bosnian War

1881
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,136
Yeah but

1882
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,208
This guy was a Bosnian Muslim

1883
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
And those times

1884
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
This this quote I really stuck with me

1885
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,840
Is it all this s*** comes along in the 90

1886
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,400
Suddenly it matters if you are Muslim Erick Rowan

1887
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
That stuff has been parked

1888
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
4 years for decades

1889
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
Those people who said

1890
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,032
These people have always hated each other

1891
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
We're just being lazy

1892
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:10,176
In my own life I saw people from different communities works together live together getting married even

1893
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,992
There's nothing

1894
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,272
It was just that a

1895
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
You the extremist

1896
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
The elite

1897
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,648
The greedy so nationalism is a way to grab what they want

1898
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,792
So

1899
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Everything

1900
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:33,984
Yeah if you want to go to Germany in 1930s

1901
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,288
When you go back and you hear those stories of like

1902
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
We live

1903
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:41,920
Perfectly well next to all of our Jewish neighbors it up one day it was like

1904
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,712
No Jews allowed

1905
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,272
And so many people just will go along with

1906
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:50,624
Nationalism

1907
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,160
Yeah everything I've read

1908
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952
About that

1909
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,232
Particular conflict

1910
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,024
Always goes back to that's

1911
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Situation

1912
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,560
And then

1913
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
After the after the war

1914
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,376
End

1915
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Switch

1916
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
You know

1917
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
Is ending is a

1918
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Is up four.

1919
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
Everybody tried to just four

1920
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
Forget you know like

1921
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,176
Oh that wasn't made that wasn't part of me I never hated you guys

1922
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:20,576
Because you have to try and live together again like that's why

1923
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
He's writing

1924
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,416
He's writing a travelogue

1925
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
Follow the footsteps of Gabriella

1926
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,536
Received from a small town to Sarajevo

1927
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,352
The car lot

1928
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
And I'm Muslim

1929
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,216
Along the way everybody is kind of

1930
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
Like

1931
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,032
Almost it seems like there's almost

1932
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Confusion

1933
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,080
About what ended up having

1934
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
Because it

1935
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
It's very difficult to look at

1936
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,456
In the face the reality of what

1937
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
Caught up in

1938
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,552
And the importance of that I believe

1939
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
Because first of all Alex's

1940
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Inline

1941
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
About Al-Qaeda being

1942
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
Used to start

1943
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
War

1944
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,976
Hi in Serbian

1945
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
In the night

1946
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Sprite

1947
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,328
Courtyard that's that's absolutely

1948
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,608
Nonsense

1949
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
But beyond that

1950
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Z

1951
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,448
The greater truth

1952
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,984
What happened there

1953
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,800
Are so applicable to Modern

1954
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,104
Time

1955
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
Good lesson

1956
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
For Alex to learn

1957
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
Especially seeing that the guy who

1958
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
He

1959
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,528
Really is in favor of

1960
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
It 2018

1961
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,368
Is presiding over one of the worst

1962
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,392
Census of race

1963
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160
Scapegoat

1964
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
Seem

1965
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,000
Maybe in our lifetime

1966
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
For sure

1967
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
The idea of

1968
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
The

1969
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
The ramping up of ice

1970
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
Deportation

1971
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,680
The the attempt

1972
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,496
Pinpointing every single Hispanic voter

1973
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
Disapprove the voting rolls

1974
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
The idea of

1975
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Posting

1976
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
Publicizing

1977
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
Immigrants

1978
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Crime

1979
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Those sorts

1980
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,760
Two things are all

1981
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
The steps

1982
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,576
That you will find

1983
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
If you look

1984
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,112
Deeper into

1985
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
The history

1986
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Ism's

1987
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,928
Did end up taking

1988
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Can place

1989
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
Like what happened

1990
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
In 1930s Germany

1991
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,584
Like what happened in the lead-up to the war in Serbia

1992
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
These sorts of things

1993
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,424
That you're talking about when people just

1994
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,008
Break with my Jewish neighbor and now I'm not

1995
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,568
They don't happen mysteriously like

1996
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,896
It's not like you wake up one day and you hate your neighbor

1997
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,176
Teach you to hate your neighbor

1998
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,480
Those are the steps

1999
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
People take two

2000
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Get you to hate your neighbor

2001
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,832
And it's fascinating to me

2002
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,856
Very depressing

2003
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:33,952
Well if the story tells the story of

2004
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,232
Terrorism in miniature

2005
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,792
Like the guy was

2006
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
Attempting to do good

2007
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:42,400
Start doing everything you could to try and

2008
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,424
Help people who

2009
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,216
The Western governments just

2010
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
Watch.

2011
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,336
Like that's a whole another foreign policy

2012
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:55,200
You can have like what's the correct way to do all this example of

2013
01:29:55,456 --> 01:30:00,320
The more realistic story of the beginnings of radicalization often

2014
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,136
It's for him and

2015
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
The world I guess

2016
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:09,024
He didn't end up going down some sort of I'm going to bomb people

2017
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,584
But you understand how easily

2018
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
I can get flipped

2019
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,912
The wrong influence

2020
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
The wrong

2021
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,728
A person in your ear

2022
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,544
Could be the difference between someone who goes

2023
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,848
Trying to give humanitarian Aid who decides to

2024
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Suffice

2025
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
Back to the oppressed

2026
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,688
The guy who

2027
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,712
Straps

2028
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,808
It's not but that's not the but that's not the initial inside

2029
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,368
I mean the inciting factor is

2030
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,648
Complete

2031
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
Oppression

2032
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
Before

2033
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,816
You know what if you want to talk about horrible s*** that

2034
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
The government is done

2035
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:50,240
Killing one-and-a-half million civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan and everywhere

2036
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
We f****** drone bomb

2037
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
Great murdered

2038
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,968
Like we're we're not the good guys

2039
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,528
And the same thing is true there with

2040
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,552
Terrorism

2041
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,416
We send a drone bomb to get a terrorist in wind up killing 20 people around

2042
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,000
And you know what you're one of those kids who survived

2043
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
And you look in Hugo

2044
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,816
Great you kill the terrorists

2045
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,352
You also killed my family

2046
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,424
Who's who's bad

2047
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
Your beauty killed my family

2048
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
I would absolutely see why people

2049
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
Become suicide bombers

2050
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
To become terrorists

2051
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Because

2052
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
F****** you kill my family

2053
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
You don't like

2054
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
I'm I totally get

2055
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
Via

2056
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
Blue understand

2057
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,720
If you want to go if you want to go with me

2058
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,024
Who perpetrated 9/11

2059
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,888
If you want to go through there that goes back yeah that's it

2060
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:56,288
I understand that I understand I understand

2061
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,128
Wondering

2062
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,920
The direction you're going to go with

2063
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,456
Rationalizing

2064
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:06,784
90s okay

2065
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:13,440
The reasoning behind it is America's actions protecting Israel and doing all of those

2066
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
Seduce

2067
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,632
Terrorism happen

2068
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
And you find that it

2069
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,448
Oftentimes just

2070
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,472
Play constant tit for

2071
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,496
Protec going back

2072
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
And back and back

2073
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,872
It's not like 911 happen because they hated are free

2074
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,432
Sprite and it's not like any of this stuff happen

2075
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
Because

2076
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,272
Muslims are crazy

2077
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
I think

2078
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,624
It may be bored

2079
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
Eloquent way

2080
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,696
To put what you're saying is

2081
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,256
The results that you see always have

2082
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Macaws

2083
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,048
Pause is

2084
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
Is generally

2085
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
Trauma

2086
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,120
It's

2087
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
Directed

2088
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,472
In the same way that senior like

2089
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,520
Your town blown up by a drone

2090
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,056
Or whatever would

2091
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
Create

2092
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:07,968
It would definitely make you susceptible to somebody saying that you can

2093
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
Do something

2094
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,088
Causation

2095
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,880
That we have in society

2096
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,184
And I mean we can go back in

2097
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
4th and conser

2098
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,000
Bicker and argue about like

2099
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
You know hey

2100
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
Well

2101
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,328
Have

2102
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,120
Drones at Village

2103
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,680
If there wasn't that terrorist we were looking

2104
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,288
Then you can play out like what was that terrorist beginning

2105
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,312
Ohey

2106
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:35,360
Had some other atrocity

2107
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:39,968
Befall him because we were fighting ex-wife

2108
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,016
You go back to the root of it but

2109
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,552
I genuinely think

2110
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
That

2111
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,392
I don't know I think I'm more productive

2112
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
Empath would be to record

2113
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
Nize that

2114
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
We are the ones

2115
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
Things

2116
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Much more

2117
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:54,816
Effectively

2118
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Stopping

2119
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:01,472
None of this to happen

2120
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,520
Ultimately the if you go back in

2121
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,800
Time if there was one thing that

2122
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
Change about

2123
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,384
It would be immediately afterwards

2124
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,920
If we Act

2125
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,712
Billy said as a country like

2126
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
We forgive you

2127
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,040
Like for real

2128
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,088
You know what

2129
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,744
Fine we're going to build it back up the exact same way that would really hurt the country did Arts

2130
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Would have

2131
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,864
Gone insane but that's the only way

2132
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
Really to stop that Circle of violence

2133
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,704
Perhaps really what it is

2134
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,752
I'm not entirely sure but you might be right

2135
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,896
Eventually somebody is going to drop

2136
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,456
And I think the only way to stop

2137
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,248
Everybody from dying is

2138
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,296
The government to go like

2139
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
That's at

2140
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,648
I don't know

2141
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
I don't know

2142
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,608
Conversation that's full of all sorts of theories and who knows

2143
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:06,752

6 times a day to not wait no.

2152

I want to

2153
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360
Because of

2154
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,896
F*** myself yourself
