Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have a great respect for Tenaya Lodge B B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,144
Alex Jones Jordan

6
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,568
Go first I have a I got a double bright spot

7
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
I got a rare double Brightside precedent it

8
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
By my partner

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Summer

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
School is out my friend

11
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Summer vacation

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
School's out for summer forever

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Absolutely

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
And then at the same time

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
We just discovered a new show

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,024
But that's old For All Mankind

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
It's alternate history what if Russia won the Space Race To The Moon sort of like a man in the High Castle

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
Absolutely

19
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Who's f****** grade

20
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
I want to be an astronaut so bad

21
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
No it is they told me my eyes were too bad probably too late

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
They haven't gotten better in the interview I feel like you're just going to need to wait

23
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Until it's really normal to go to space

24
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
And then you could be a space cowboy type of guy

25
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
Just going up there a Ruffian and that'll be pretty cool

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
For sure

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,448
I'm going to have to I'm going to have to learn Jeet Kune Do that'll take about Mandalorian right

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
Spike Spiegel my man bouquet

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Okay that's the way to do it all right

30
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
I don't have a ride for

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
I'm not cool enough

32
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Because I can be jet though I can cook

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
I'm tall

34
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,528
Those are my qualities

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
Attempt

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I guess

37
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
I wish you the best.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Thank you very much actually is

39
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Itrip

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
2 St Louis

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,496
Planned in the near future I get to go my

42
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Mutual friends what do you do for my stand-up days is getting married

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
And

44
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,432
Destination wedding

45
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
He must be back in Missouri Maya my buddy Nick

46
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
The gift was there so absolutely

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
Good time

48
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Weather

49
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
I was going to see this as a bright spot but I'm going to put it in as a sort of an addendum

50
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
Dreamy creamy summer is going on as we all know of course

51
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
And I have been

52
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
Some creams some of them have been dreamy

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Some of them have been

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Dreamy creamy

55
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
I have to say

56
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,600
Jeni's Ice Cream is being treated by everybody as like

57
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
This is such great ice

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:44,768
It's a tie level everyone loves it and I've got to say the price tag

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
What do you do to believe

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
I got Boston cream

61
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Green pie Jennings flavor

62
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
I look

63
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
No shade on Jenny

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
She's great

65
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
I'm sure she is

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
I got to say

67
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Fudge

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Is really hyped up on the package

69
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
We got this great fudge

70
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
It's true

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Is

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,904
F****** Hershey's syrup

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
The Taste exactly like Hershey syrup

74
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Now that's something you getting a bottle and you pour into your mouth when you're high

75
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
Here's my problem with all ice cream

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
No one person

77
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Can make that many flavors

78
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
Alright you can't do it though it's not just

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
I understand it's not just an entity a hive-mind if you will

80
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
Only create so many flavors Baskin-Robbins did not have

81
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
126 flavors

82
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
The correct amount

83
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
31

84
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Maximum that can be made one for each of the most days of the month I have to say if if I can be frank I would say that

85
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
I don't think Boston cream pie is like

86
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,703
Number one an Innovative flavor nor do I think it's that difficult to emulate

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
It's got custard you know what channel 8

88
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,943
Chocolate somehow

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,015
That price I am looking for a little more than Hershey's syrup Jenny

90
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
You realize

91
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,743
It was actually not too bad I just felt like a little bit

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
Change nothing fun about things

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Okay

94
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Could have been better

95
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Nobody could have

96
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
It wasn't f****** Hershey syrup

97
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,359
So Jordan today we have episode in front of us minisode I suppose

98
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
I will see what

99
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Entailing

100
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
But Didi situation I wanted to just give a little bit of

101
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Does a

102
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
Context and maybe a little bit of an apology

103
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Feedback about this

104
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
People

105
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Are reaching out then

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
More people may have

107
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Felt this way

108
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
I

109
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
They want to just say hey sorry that we did not give more of

110
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
The point to

111
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
Mike Tyson's history of abuse and rape conviction

112
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
On our last episode

113
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
I know that

114
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,599
It's not your responsibility Jordan to bring things up responding person

115
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
Falls more on me and the reason that I didn't include

116
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
More of it as a point to bring up in

117
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
Really thought that we talked about it before in the past

118
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
I'm pretty sure we had more.

119
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Detail

120
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
That might be a misconception on my part or or whatever but I

121
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
I I felt like it would be sort of redundant

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Rite Aid

123
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Bye

124
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Do you know Microsoft

125
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Options maybe off on that

126
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
I am 22 weeks and felt like we were just given short shrift to that I I apologize I don't that

127
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
I want that to be the perception that

128
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
It's not you know who this is

129
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,255
Awful history isn't a big deal

130
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
I suppose it's the best

131
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
But it sure

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Today the situation we have in front of us is

133
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Trouble

134
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Trouble yes

135
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Alex

136
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Has been

137
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Studio C

138
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
June 6th pure

139
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,967
Sure he has been on vacation or a work

140
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,807
Location share

141
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
And you know there's a lot of stuff that's been going on

142
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
I think

143
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
I think bears

144
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
His response

145
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
But I'm interested

146
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Where he's at about these things

147
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
From the proud boys being indicted for sedition

148
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Conspiracy

149
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
And the fact that

150
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Barry's video of

151
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:43,103
Enrique tarrio the leader of the proud boys meeting in the basement of a parking garage with

152
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Stewart Road who are being charged with sedition

153
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
Conspiracy meeting in a Clint that they would pay they work together

154
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Conspiratorially

155
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Curious buddies take on

156
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,463
Some of that his absence might be a little glaring even

157
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,351
CNN apparently Ramsey documentary about Alex that you know curious

158
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
What his thoughts are on that

159
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Joe Biggs

160
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,775
Apparently hired nor pattice

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Curious what Alex thinks about to have to stay there

162
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
I was thinking about this

163
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
If I were Alex I would have fired Norm immediately

164
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
If you was going

165
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
Represent

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
It needs seditious

167
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Conspiracy trial because

168
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
It provides to close of a link

169
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,767
How could you be like well of course we share the same lawyer but I've never met this guy before in my work for

170
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Diagnose

171
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Come on man

172
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
I would be like no you cannot represent

173
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,751
Yeah it really must being that the

174
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Cool is that shallow

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
The pool has to be that shallow which is almost reassuring

176
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
If you

177
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Afford to fire Norm baddest

178
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
That means there aren't that many options

179
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Or

180
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Conversely Alex

181
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Got Joe Biggs

182
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
A lawyer

183
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
Because otherwise Joe might say something

184
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
I don't know but it's it's

185
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
It has the appearance of the lake

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Rank shadiness

187
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Norfolk

188
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,543
Do you think that would be like if in the wire you don't have the cartel and they had that

189
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,175
Huge lawyer Maurice Levy

190
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,551
If they had literally Foghorn Leghorn has the cartels

191
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Don't worry

192
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,207
You're going to do 5 but we got a good lawyer for a I'll show you the proud boys did nothing wrong now you're here

193
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
Exactly why are you hiring also like

194
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
You know it would probably look even worse if

195
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Thank God this

196
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Isn't the case

197
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
If Alex

198
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Didn't publicly join the proud boys

199
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
That would be a problem

200
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
Oh there was a McGinnis

201
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
Initiated him alive on the show that's not good

202
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,647
She was he hasn't been in studio so we don't have any episodes where he goes

203
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Listen to talk about these things

204
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Time since he's been on

205
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
He's called in

206
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Ameriben

207
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Some

208
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Little Snippets

209
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
And we're going to go over a little bit of that

210
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,287
It doesn't Merit a full episode and also when I was on the phone or doing this

211
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Pre-record

212
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
It's not really that interesting

213
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
No cuz

214
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
He's going to just hit kind of standard he knows like what I got to do about that

215
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
The tight time here not like when he has to fill three hours and there's like plenty of time for him to expound on

216
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Dumb Fox to be able to have

217
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Freewheeling

218
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
Explosions of improv he can't be held into a small

219
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Container

220
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
Noticed as a performer

221
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
He needs to be able to explore the space absolutely

222
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
And yes it's kind of a bummer

223
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
On the 7th

224
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
There's no call

225
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
No, he doesn't call in on the 7th

226
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Xavier

227
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Comes along and Alex

228
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
Calls into agitate about of a migrant Caravan

229
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,671
There's migrant Caravan

230
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
Where is he that he's catching migrant Caravan

231
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
It's mostly just an excuse to be like

232
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
And then the economy will collapse that's why you go by my survival

233
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Nothing happens until the 10th

234
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
And

235
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
Is the day after the first January 6th committee

236
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
And so

237
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,759
And here is him introducing a little phone

238
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Conversation without

239
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,647
Just being in this historic moment seeing where the Democrats are going

240
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
There's never been such an evil force in this country I don't know if the country's ever experienced

241
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
The government weaponize against the people like we're seeing right now

242
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
How do we harness this energy for good how do we

243
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
How do we take these trying times

244
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,079
And turn them into a positive for America to unite the people to bring people together back with love

245
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Desire for freedom and prosperity

246
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Cuz I know it's there Alex

247
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
I know it's there

248
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
That's exactly

249
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Starting a civil war there

250
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Organizations

251
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
The New World Order

252
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,263
Really f***** up

253
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
Bears

254
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
Do the show as long as we have

255
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
You know that

256
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Periodically colors

257
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
We'll ask Alex

258
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
When is it time to start shooting

259
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,927
When you see this at you know various qna

260
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Big directly asked out

261
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,583
They were always in a Cold War what we went when does it turn hot Alex

262
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
Well apparently it's hot now yeah

263
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Yep

264
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Definition

265
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
This is something good Alex just says as a throwaway doesn't mean

266
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Anything to him

267
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
But it's

268
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
To the right

269
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Year of his listeners

270
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
This has the potential for them to be like this is Alex giving massage

271
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Go ahead

272
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Do it like that

273
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
It's got to be dramatic

274
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
I mean it listen

275
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
You would not get

276
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
You would not believe Alex

277
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Calling for it from a phone

278
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Yeah you would know

279
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Because you would think maybe

280
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
He's in a bunker

281
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607

00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,047
Alex Jones Infowars pirate underground post-apocalyptic radio beat

I want to go back to last

299
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Dot-com

300
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
They are framing

301
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
The Americans

302
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
People terrorists

303
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Position as terrorists

304
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Decided not to surveillance

305
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
We're just two weeks ago the

306
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Two random people

307
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
In the middle of the street

308
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Colorado

309
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Okay

310
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
People

00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,103
Cialix is hanging his hat on that bring it up as a sort of a counter

312
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
Example or whatever

313
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
The situation where they were

314
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,039
Car that was not slowing down before running out of the way

315
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,135
The guy ended up accidentally hitting two people

316
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Shooting them

317
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
And they both

318
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Ask for restored

319
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Justice opposed

320
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Analogous

321
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
At all and it's not worth using as a example for like

322
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
Oh yeah

323
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
What about that one guy from that one time way back over there in a small town as opposed to the capital of

324
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Knighted goddamn state

325
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Yeah

326
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Square

327
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
It appears

328
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
That

329
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,439
Some representatives were complicit in some stuff and she knowingly or not

330
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,071
Perhaps and there were multiple groups of real f*****-up weirdo ride

331
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
With plans guns

332
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Alex's friends

333
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Long-time gas

334
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Like for instance

335
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,919
They played a video of Stewart Road

336
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
Alex is like

337
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
So I never heard Stewart Roads

338
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
People talk about

339
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Information

340
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
We were all concerned

341
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Security for some of the events we have

342
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Before

343
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Everybody knows that

344
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
Hey look we got a million

345
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Joe Biden

346
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Campfield

347
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Jeep dealership

348
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
Maybe one of the reasons that Trump could draw these big crowds and Biden was unable to his cuz Trump's fanbase thought that ignoring public

349
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
Health advice was a central tenet of their political ideology

350
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
Big part of it

351
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
To do with it

352
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Owen Shroyer was burning a black lives

353
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
A matter of like outside his hotel the night before cuz he was afraid of Antigua if you burn a black lives matter

354
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Butterfly gets like it's at you no like me

355
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Mosquitoes can't

356
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,623
Get to the Zumba the smoke it said that's what he was thinking you know right I guess I don't know

357
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,023
Now just seems like bulshit 100% lies that they made up that they were not absolutely afraid of it all

358
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Alex saying like I've never heard Stewart

359
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
Talk about going into the capitol

360
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,079
Astor was talking about going as a capitalized in Eldritch

361
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
I wonder if you heard Matt Bracken

362
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
Talk about it on Infowars

363
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,855
A 31st remember when we played that on the are your buddy

364
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Guy who

365
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
This is not anymore

366
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
I hope he's okay

367
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
6 anymore

368
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
If this looks a little bit longer because

369
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Speed the direction it goes

370
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Is

371
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Not good

372
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
American people

373
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Preposterous

374
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
16 days

375
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Baldy

376
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
The real issue

377
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Because

378
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Daily contacts

379
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Constantly

380
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
For two years

381
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
You got

382
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Hollywood star

383
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
His hometown

384
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
The police live

385
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
40 + X Change

386
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
18 *

387
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
For now

388
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
State Police or the

389
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Was this on January 6th

390
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
We know we're being lied to

391
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
All of this right on

392
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
On time

393
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
For the midterms

394
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Didn't happen

395
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
What I'm saying is

396
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
This thing is

397
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Well I can't

398
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
All I'm saying is

399
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
Is the season and the timing

400
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
McConaughey's town

401
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
President

402
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Later

403
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
This is

404
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Massive massive

405
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
If you were going on everybody

406
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Like

407
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
I don't know how else

408
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,591
You can really interpret interpret it as

409
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Keep living 20-24 that right all right all right

410
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Ends in the White House

411
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,463
Right we had the Michelle Obama Hillary

412
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
That is a stupid

413
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Amazingly stupid yeah

414
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,423
Good road to go down Alex

415
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,751
Two words from your brain you would have to spend a lot of money to go

416
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
Get Sandy Hook removed from his brain and safe

417
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Billion dollars right

418
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
I mean if your damn yeah

419
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
Like Eternal Sunshine that's not just bring up Sandy Hook

420
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
You know he number of anomalies Within

421
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Sandy Hook

422
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,048
I know from being in a deposition room with him

423
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
Talking about this stuff

424
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,656
He doesn't know any anomalies about Sandy Hook

425
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
Well then he is making it a completely accurate state

426
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Will 10:00

427
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
Exactly but yeah this is

428
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Yeah they're not not good

429
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Not good

430
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Now is the time

431
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
To be like

432
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Listen

433
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,344
There were a lot of anomalies at Sandy Hook why am I talking

434
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
What is happening

435
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:54,048
12 because you need to do something with the like the January 6th comedian talking about that a hearing is probably not for

436
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
You're the best

437
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,912
So you got to put it in the context of this is all part of

438
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
Demonizing Us in order to win the midterm

439
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
Bill's big part of that is also this

440
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
Buffalo shooting in the Uvalde

441
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
The shooter

442
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
And it's all this

443
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Season the

444
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
Planning

445
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Is just

446
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
I'm saying it was staged

447
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,416
Maybe not actors and no people died maybe wasn't totally fake

448
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
But yeah this is

449
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
This is bad

450
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
I think this this

451
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
This Blake form of this info is got a

452
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Run its course

453
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,728
Actually write like it all sounds exactly the same though the Russian to send photo the

454
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Whenever MBS

455
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,384
Khashoggi like the all the denials are so similar in just like this

456
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,016
Absolutely didn't happen and if it did happen it wasn't that big a deal but it didn't happen in there lying about it

457
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,880
They're lying because they don't want you to talk about that thing that they did right there and I definitely didn't kill khashoggi

458
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,184
100% okay well I did it but

459
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
You can't do s*** about it like that

460
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,072
It's the same way ever yell Benghazi and throw a smoke bomb

461
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
Yes it matter where it's coming from

462
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Tell me a fact

463
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Right

464
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
Certainly not so long or legs

465
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
X's and O's snap bracelet

466
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,688
Good because I think it appeals to people's emotional w

467
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
They walked

468
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Denial

469
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
To give it to them they'll accept it

470
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
They just really yeah

471
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Well it's easier than admitting that you have

472
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
Participated in a horrific violence against

473
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Text everybody

474
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,096
I think the Alex I still don't know

475
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
There's strong evidence

476
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Alex

477
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
Knew anything about what people might have

478
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Been doing

479
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Haunted

480
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
And if that evidence has come out

481
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
Thrilled to see it

482
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
But

483
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
If Alex were to take seriously the things that are known

484
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
And have come out

485
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
The weather be from these indictments

486
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
Or the testimony

487
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
And be things that we've heard from the commission

488
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,608
Alex would really have to do a little bit of soul-searching about why it is

489
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
He promoted

490
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
The Oath Keepers and Stewart Road

491
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
For as long as he did

492
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
Doesn't instantly as he did Even though Stewart Road was constantly talking

493
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
About wanting to shoot people

494
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
And wanting her to be

495
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
A situation where Trump would

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
Deputize him as the sheriff of the United States

497
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Basically

498
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
You'd have to wrestle with y

499
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
He helped promote the proud boys

500
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Gavin McInnes on

501
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
In the earlier times and supported

502
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,864
Rufio panman based Stickman

503
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
And all of these people

504
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Like

505
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
He'd have to wrestle with the fact that there were these group

506
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
That we're actively involved in planning

507
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
To do what happen

508
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
He is a part of that

509
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
Constellation weather he was knowingly

510
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,808
Involved in any of that planning or do anything about it

511
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Or if

512
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
He was just

513
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Be louder

514
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Cheerleader and facilitator for these groups

515
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
For the last

516
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Decade

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Yeah you know it

518
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Well I mean

519
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
The thing that he's got going

520
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
That dumb is

521
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Not just that

522
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
But

523
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
The time that he was like this and I'm not going to tell you

524
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Anyways my sources Donald Trump

525
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
What's you know that that's going to happen you just don't

526
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Tell Alex that s***

527
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,760
You don't tell Alex anything that he's going to say on air

528
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,856
So that became a known quantity I think among that group so

529
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,184
I doubt he has anything that is I doubt they gave him any information

530
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
That he could repay

531
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
Well I think I said this before

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
I think I feel like that

533
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Still feel this way until

534
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,168
Someone could provide any like real evidence but like

535
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
I think that Alex would have behaved the exact same way he

536
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
He did on the six

537
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Whether or not

538
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
He knew any

539
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
You don't need to tell him of any plans

540
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,760
Nokia's just a guy who's going to try and incite a crowd and yellow 1776

541
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
All the time so

542
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,672
If you just plant him somewhere he's going to do whatever he did

543
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,256
Telling him the plan only gives him something to rage again

544
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,352
Right you know he would be a chaotic agent against your plan

545
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,424
Where is if he doesn't know the plan he can be the 8th chaotic age

546
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Agent that you want him

547
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
I think

548
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
I feel like

549
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Strategically that would be

550
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
And you're best if it makes sense

551
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,480
Now I have these people acted in their best interest 100% of the time no

552
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
No matter also kind of dumb

553
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Yeah

554
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
Be at the other thing I wanted after wrestle with

555
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
It was is the fact that Joe Biggs

556
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Used to work at Infowars

557
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
For quite a while

558
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
And was

559
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Involved in the

560
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Conversation

561
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
With proud boys

562
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
In a planning a

563
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Senior leadership in

564
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
The moment you ask

565
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
Ask yourself the question why are all of my friend

566
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Nazis

567
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
There's really only two ants

568
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,104
Add you can say yes or no to what

569
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
You know

570
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
Yep is it cuz I'm a Nazi

571
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Yes or no

572
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
And I bad news raps

573
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
The

574
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
The next day's a little quiet

575
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
And we get to the 14th

576
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,768
And this is where we hear a little bit more formality

577
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
Infowars has been inundated the last week

578
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,424
Viewers asking where is Alex Jones if I

579
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,264
I've been on a business / vacation trip

580
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
On the West Coast

581
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,128
I have had a lot of people

582
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
And the answer is

583
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
I never take time off

584
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
We also have a lot of

585
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Sponsor opportunities of the things

586
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,976
Edward needs a personal touch that I've been involved in

587
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
I am taking off

588
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
OurTime

589
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
At least for the rest of this week

590
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
In studio

591
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,264
Crazy world

592
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Alex needs to disclose

593
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
You gave him that money because

594
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
He got eight million dollars in Bitcoin and then took a week off on a

595
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
Very uncharacteristically long

596
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Work vacation

597
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
It kind of

598
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,672
Lead someone to think that maybe that mystery donor

599
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
Looks like you got to come

600
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
I visit there you got it we got to talk about

601
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Plans or something

602
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
I gave you a million dollars guess what you're going to give

603
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't know if that's the case but that's the reason that Alex needs to be a little bit more transparent

604
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,080
Because it does create the impression it's a possible conclusion people could come to

605
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,432
Absolutely

606
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
Like I think the

607
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
That's what

608
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Start to get suspicious of like

609
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Hey what's going on

610
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
You doing

611
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
Yeah you know

612
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,792
At the end of this I'm so worried that we're going to find out that his listeners are like there's just a

613
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
The total of 1000

614
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Some people but there's

615
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
Two of them who by

616
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
A trillion dollars worth of product everyday

617
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Unlikely done like

618
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
But come on

619
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
This is so absurd how can you

620
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Still be trapped in his

621
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Brady

622
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,688
Well I think that one of the reasons is because no one looks

623
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
This is critically and no one

624
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,344
No one who's not sort of in a conspiratorial mindset really

625
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Pays attention

626
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
Google look I'm saying

627
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm saying

628
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
That Alex is vacation

629
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
Could be entirely about sponsors that he's going to visit it could be something where he needs

630
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
The new supplement line

631
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
But

632
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
The lack of transparency does

633
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Weird one

634
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
To think

635
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,080
Maybe these things are connected

636
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
Conspiracy theorist listening to a conspiracy theory show and a guy conspiratorially got a billion dollars and then

637
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
And ran away for awhile I think maybe there's a

638
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Conspiracy

639
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,184
But none of that is jumping to that conclusion that is just a logistical things like

640
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
A + B could

641
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,816
Sequel see this is weird right you should clear this up so people don't

642
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
If this isn't

643
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
The case you would think

644
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Realistically this is more what is Audie

645
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
Where is

646
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
Conspiracy here

647
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Doing all right now January 6th

648
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,136
Thinking maybe that I was going to repetitive the hills or something it again

649
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
That is not

650
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
This has been planned for a long time

651
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Separately

652
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,400
If I try to respond Olivia January 6th lies or just CNN lies

653
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
Let it be fair last Sunday

654
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:37,056
Important

655
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah sure

656
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,688
His audiences more like Alex's disappear

657
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:49,088
If you run away in the bunker

658
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Did they give him is he in the gulag

659
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Yeah

660
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,256
Remind of The Listener is far more creative

661
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
They come up with more abstract and a toriel explanation

662
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
For why Alex is gone as opposed to like

663
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
Probably some sort of shady business

664
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Yeah I can't possibly

665
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Just be that somebody

666
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Gave him $8000000

667
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,688
Weird why would you suddenly take a trip for $8000000 that's practically

668
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
More than seven million dollars

669
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
A little higher

670
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
We have one more clip here from the 14th

671
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
And

672
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Good news

673
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,000
Course

674
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Are going to

675
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,472
We are real

676
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
We are legitimate

677
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,616
And the people

678
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
I am travel to multiple States

679
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
On the West Coast

680
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Last week

681
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
All four of them

682
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Mob

683
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Grocery stores

684
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Bob

685
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
Mom at hotels I mean

686
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Bob

687
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
25 people

688
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,752
Chapping pictures asking for autographs

689
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
What are we doing

690
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
We know you're right

691
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,640
We know you told the truth hero Legend

692
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
The point is

693
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
A couple of things

694
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
First

695
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,848
Celebrity ding dong

696
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:53,248
Think about me

697
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Give me I'm with this a******

698
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,928
Take a picture you show your friend and I think people would want to know that your kind of violent

699
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,768
So maybe don't want to fight you in about maybe

700
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,632
Also yeah sure

701
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,472
It's the same strfkr either that he treats other people with

702
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
He's being treated by

703
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
By the labors

704
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Second thing

705
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
I know that we've heard

706
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Alex

707
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Disgusting sort of

708
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
Perceptual distortions

709
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,624
Yeah like when people in the grocery store turn into demons and go back

710
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
I think he might have some

711
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
A+ versions of Suspicion baby

712
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
This is his inability to gauge reality

713
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
I will say

714
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
But that sounds suspiciously like

715
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,312
Every movie scene where the guy is looking in the mirror after having a huge crisis

716
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,896
Confidence and then builds himself back up Psychopathic lie with that

717
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Do you know what

718
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
You are right

719
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,016
Everybody loves you every time you see somebody on the street they come down and they say

720
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
You know what your Greek god

721
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
That's exactly what that was

722
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
Yeah

723
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,232
But it's good news is good news great news

724
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,280
Great news tell me better news is in the

725
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Bibleman

726
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,376
The author of lies that has children

727
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
And they want to tell you that Infowars is no good

728
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,568
They are the writers assistance of Lies

729
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
So stupid

730
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,552
So I honestly think like there isn't

731
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,416
Much that's interested like a lot of the stuff their response you'd have

732
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
To the January 6th and I even the CNN thing is kind of

733
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Same thing after talking points

734
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Boilerplate nonsense

735
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
So like I don't even

736
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Listening over this I don't even feel like

737
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
Most of it was

738
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Worth

739
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
The time but

740
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
I think honestly

741
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Clip where he's

742
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Talking about

743
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,504
Uvalde in the Buffalo shooting his outrageous

744
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
It shows end illegal mentality

745
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,792
Will be back on Monday with the Fuller episode

746
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,144
To be a little bit too nebulous territory cuz Alex did say he's going to be gone

747
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Until

748
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Next week

749
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,520
Sprite and so by Monday or Sunday when we record there won't be

750
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Any content

751
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Two golfers a lot that

752
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Figure something out right we will ya

753
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
We will and I'll tell you what

754
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
It based on his going rate we

755
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
We cannot afford to

756
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
To get Alex back in studio

757
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,880
No we do not have that kind of scratch neither doesn't for Bitcoin her otherwise

758
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
Another thing to ingest real quick

759
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
I

760
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
I wanted to give this

761
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,400
Qualifier about next episode

762
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,984
We were making a big joke out of like how Tyson needs

763
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
To lick the toad

764
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
And like how

765
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,640
It's cowardly.

766
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,968
Very much

767
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:11,392
Safe responsible service message

768
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,000
I do think that we did

769
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,328
Make a point that there is some research into

770
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,400
Chemical

771
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,752
Could have psychological benefits

772
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
But maybe we didn't

773
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
Maybe we were a little bit more derisive of the whole thing then

774
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
Maybe we should have been takeaway that's not

775
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,576
It was not our point it's worth it

776
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Licking toads is very funny

777
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
Nothing else

778
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
I don't know if the benefits

779
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
It are the certain thing where you would

780
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,424
Do it 60 times I don't know I don't know

781
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
That's not but I'm not I'm not a shaman

782
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Yeah I don't know either

783
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:07,200

Which school I chose the Black Eagle

788
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,536
Right you couldn't be the same so I chose

789
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
In the blue lions

790
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
Hope you all have a dreamy creamy summer

791
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984

792
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
