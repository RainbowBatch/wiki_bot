00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Shrimp scampi

191
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
Anyway let's get down to business

192
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
Just so Alex starts off the show here on November 11th

193
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
Standing in front of his desk

194
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
As if you some sort of a real professional news

195
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
And he knows that this is weird so he decides to explain why

196
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,839
In front of his desk asking why lately I've been out

197
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Front

198
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
When we start the show many times

199
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Behind the desk

200
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,615
Probably years many times I've got nothing over the map wall or go to a video feed and

201
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Pointing things out like a weatherman would do

202
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
Political weathermen

203
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
With only

204
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
357 days left to this historic election

205
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
I'm doing it because

206
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
I want a note

207
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Visually

208
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Everyone

209
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
We're not in Kansas anymore

210
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
The world is really on the brink

211
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
A total breakdown disaster if good people

212
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Don't exert our full political

213
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Cultural economic and spiritual will

214
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,991
Because if we fail with that we're going to have to exert our physical will because we have no other choice

215
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
Grandpa's coming at a show damn evil there will be worldwide massive

216
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Civil war and violence

217
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Until he got to the end there I was sitting here like why did I cut this clip this is so uninspired and boring and then I realize

218
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
We lose the election we're going to have to murder all of our political enemies

219
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Clip to cut

220
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,799
There I think that would this is why I'm political weathermen

221
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
I know of other political weatherman that Alex hates

222
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Yeah

223
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Bill Ayers

224
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
But yeah so that's a bad note

225
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Start the show offline

226
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Yeah

227
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,719
His main storyline throughout that least the beginning of this episode is about to the revelations

228
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Nikki Haley

229
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Brought forth

230
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
About how

231
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Rex Tillerson

232
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
And

233
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Who was it

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,263
McMaster Kelly Maybe

235
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
They were trying to

236
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
Stop Trump from causing

237
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Trouble

238
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
And I Alex describe

239
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Have this

240
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
As treason

241
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,783
I'm going to lay out information here on the show today

242
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
That is of the

243
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Complete Paramount

244
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Importance

245
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Nikki Haley

246
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Former governor

247
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
Ambassador from the US

248
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Battery issues my I've had problems with her

249
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
But she least understand that is treason

250
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
When you undermine the president

251
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
And try to set him up and when he signs executive order you take control and trash can

252
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
Or what he says bring me infowars.com articles daily

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
You refuse to do it

254
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
That is

255
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Freezer

256
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,327
Quite frankly not allowing him to have Infowars articles is not true

257
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Disobedience turned into trees and real quick right yeah yeah

258
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
An inability to disentangle those two things

259
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Not kowtowing

260
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
2 and doing exactly what Trump tells you to do

261
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
A man who's made his brand on

262
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
Defying Authority and disobeying a every possibility

263
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,791
Getting headache while you're just replacing forwards articles with whatever

264
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
You're not getting a coffee

265
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Who is this

266
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Ridiculous

267
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
So they were trying to keep him for his articles away from

268
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Because

269
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
They were on

270
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
To the mainstay

271
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Early

272
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
High-powered

273
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Billionaires

274
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Drunk

275
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
I'm so fool

276
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
We hear the establishment under run things you'll be out in just a few months

277
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Call the president

278
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
Couldn't even get them on the phone so they called Rodger Stone

279
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
The next day and so did I

280
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
We got told if you don't keep your mouth shut your dead

281
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
Ilevel CIA unit

282
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Piss up a rope

283
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Are you better

284
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Better make sure I don't see you coming

285
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
I'll piss on you how's that sound

286
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Family Show

287
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,399
You piss up a rope and don't act like I thought you was going to say if you see me coming I'm going to kick your ass not I'm going to pee on

288
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
Very strange

289
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,823
He's gross weird

290
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
How is it that we're on we're going to

291
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Kill everybody could start a new Civil War and then

292
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,575
Backstage bulshit now we're peeing on people I don't know

293
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Stuff happened for particular reason

294
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
That I think I'll

295
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
I'll be able to lay out as we go along

296
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,583
Also how is this supposed to work with that whole notion of like Trump's it's up till 3 in the morning

297
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Just sitting by the phone

298
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
The people normal people can call him

299
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,567
Too busy talking to some guy from Idaho

300
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Have a good day

301
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
I think this show starting out weird

302
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Because

303
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
What Nikki Haley is bringing out does matchup

304
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
Pretty closely with what Alex has yelled about

305
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
For a long time

306
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Assertive

307
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
Miniature version of he doesn't know how to win

308
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
He doesn't know how to take this and

309
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
And just run with it. There's got to be more

310
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,679
So Alex says starts talking about the plans to demoralize the

311
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
The country should know

312
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
You just see them everywhere

313
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,639
Receipt you can see them they're there their manifest all around. Let's see what they are

314
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
Because when you are conquering a nation and selling it off

315
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,271
Butchering it a dumbing it down

316
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
Psychologically demoralizing it and poisoning

317
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Breaking up the family

318
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
That's how you do it from

319
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
There are the 49 secret plans of the Communist to bring down

320
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
Alma famous senatorial reports

321
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
What's the Russian communist

322
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,199
Started taking over Russia we're using the same poison on us we gotta

323
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Read those lists are on air today that we will

324
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
I don't know what

325
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
WikiLeaks

326
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
Stuff he's talking about cuz he's always so vague with that stuff

327
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
I know that he's talked about those demoralize and

328
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
Divide and all that stuff

329
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
Relation to like the podesta and Clinton

330
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
And so I decided like I have no idea what he's ever talk

331
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
I'm about he never

332
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
I'm going to look through those emails

333
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,359
I didn't read all of them cuz there's words

334
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
If you so I

335
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
I searched around

336
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
For articles

337
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
About like the most damning thing

338
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Things that were in those eat

339
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Because

340
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,671
You know I'm not going to look through everything for the podcast there's just there's no way I have that time

341
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
So it's a little bit voyeuristic of annex

342
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Exercise for me

343
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
You two like to read these emails because I know that

344
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Then they weren't meant to be public

345
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
320 process feel like it's less like

346
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Research and more like Snoopy

347
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,079
No that's to say that there isn't stuff that's worth the being covered in those email dumps I just think they've been covered pretty

348
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Play this boy

349
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
And I can't really find any material about demoralizing

350
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Society

351
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Being the Cornerstone of some democrat globalist

352
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Can't find any articles

353
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Citing that

354
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
Well did you search for corn

355
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Cornerstone

356
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Globalist plot

357
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Is there a lot of words

358
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Demoralize only shows up

359
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
And completely unrelated context in the Hillary

360
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
And only in one

361
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Email in the protest

362
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Files

363
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
Email from May 24th 2015 with a campaign cable that served as a rundown of stories in the media about

364
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Out Hillary

365
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
The word demoralize shows up in a copy and pasted Chung

366
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
From an article on real

367
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Clear politics

368
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
With a headline quote why less competition

369
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Is hurtful

370
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:35,231
The article is basically positing that without a strong rival from within the Democratic Party

371
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,303
She won't have an opportunity to defend her record in the prime

372
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
So questions about her controversies

373
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Controversies will still be on the table

374
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
When she answers the general election

375
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,567
This Dynamic also means that all the media attention would be on Hillary prior prior to the general

376
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
The article says quote

377
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Well media attention is

378
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Appositive

379
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,271
Out for a candidate being it's almost Soul focus on the Democratic side has not been easy

380
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
And this could well serve to demoralize Democratic voters

381
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
They're already signs that in the Nash

382
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
National polls

383
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,023
I'd like to say that this is what Alex has taken and misrepresented but honestly I have no idea

384
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
That's Amore lies Democratic voters

385
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Podesta emails

386
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,799
I don't know I have no idea he always just says it's in the Wikileaks and never explain to

387
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Any further so

388
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
I don't

389
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
You know if he doesn't care to be more specific

390
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
Pacific I'm just going to Zumiez making s*** up until

391
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Find

392
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
To the contrary

393
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
You might as well just say look it up it was on the news in the sky

394
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,487
Plane flew and it wrote it in the sky

395
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
What's be more specific look into it further but as it stands

396
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
It's now but I don't know what is you talkin about babies

397
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Some sort of a

398
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Like other

399
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Email dump

400
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
Some other documents Wikileaks one of the lesser-known ones you know

401
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Is the B-side

402
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
He's he's a real into the original way

403
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
So now about those 49 plans of communism

404
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
The first thing I should tell you that there's only 45

405
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
And I should tell you that it's b*******

406
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
On January 10th

407
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
1960

408
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,535
Three representative Herlong of Florida took her to the floor of the house

409
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
He said that a constituent of his was an Ardent an enemy of communism

410
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
And requested that he read the 45

411
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
Goals of communism

412
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
Into the first official Congressional Record

413
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Because a representative ready

414
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,407
These goals and it was recorded now all these people think that it's something real

415
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,063
These 45 goals of Communism were red directly out of the naked communist by W Cleon skousen

416
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Jamaica capital

417
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
No that's his other book

418
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
He has

419
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Fall Guy Tv the whole series it's just these to make a communist was about justifying

420
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
McCarthyism

421
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,887
It's a it's a misrepresentation of a lot of that communist

422
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:55,263
Right Red Scare s*** is about Carol quickly

423
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
And misrepresenting the anglo-american

424
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Establishment

425
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
And tragedy

426
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Anyway

427
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
He didn't even

428
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Finish the trilogy

429
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,039
I mean I guess you could say the five thousand year leap was

430
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
Maybe that butt naked franchise going

431
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Naked leap yeah absolutely so anyone who's listen to our show long enough knows that W Cleon skousen

432
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,119
He was an anti-communist propaganda Stew was probably too extreme

433
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
For the John Birch

434
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Society in the late 5th

435
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
And his books the naked capitalist and naked communist are bedrocks of Alex Jones is stupid world.

436
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,431
These 45 goals of communism a part of a rich tradition of forgeries pretending to be Revelations

437
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
The secret machinations of the communist

438
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,391
They were yeah I mean to some extent a lot of the stuff is that is part of this

439
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Literary tradition of yay

440
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,303
There was a list of communist rules for revolution that popped up in the mid-50s

441
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
Which was said to have been discovered by Allied soldiers back in 1919

442
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
Of course it was a complete hoax

443
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,055
But it served to give Focus to the fears and paranoia is that were popping up in the Cold War era

444
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
The Communist enemy was so mysterious

445
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,175
List of people that it became insanely easy to demonize your enemy

446
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
By releasing

447
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Fake documents

448
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
The purport to show that's a wet Vista

449
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
40 secretly in line with the secret plans of the commies

450
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
We're basically commies

451
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
And therefore the end of

452
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
That's all skousen blisters

453
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a completely fake pile of s*** you wrote to pushes politics

454
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
He disagreed

455
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Number 13 being

456
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Party hard was a

457
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
So this is a huge problem because Alex clearly think

458
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
It's categorically not real

459
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Also it's

460
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
Kind of funny when you actually read the rules because Alex Jones himself is furthering some of these fake Communist goals

461
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,440
Number 24 is quote eliminate all laws governing obscenity and calling them by calling them sense

462
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Shipping a violation

463
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
The free speech of the Free Press

464
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
If I'm not much mistaken Alex fancies himself a bit of

465
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Absolutist these days

466
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,216
Absolutely would support getting rid of all obscenity laws that limit free expression

467
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
I guess either,

468
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
Number 35 is quote discredit and eventual

469
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
We dismantle the FBI

470
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
If I'm not much

471
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
What's Alex's spent the last

472
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,600
3 years of his on-air career screaming about how the FBI's completely infiltrated by globalist in Trump needs to

473
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
The clean house in jail all of them

474
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
Skwarkami would do

475
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Most damningly

476
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
Number 42 is quote

477
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,144
Create the impression that violence and Insurrection or legitimate aspect of American tradition

478
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
If I'm not much mistaken In This Very episode

479
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,312
Alex's discussed the necessity of insurrection if his team doesn't win the next

480
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Alexa

481
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,688
Goddamn catchphrases the answer to 1984 is 1776

482
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
Alex Jones is someone who is very very into making violent

483
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Insurrection illegitimate

484
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Aspect of America

485
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Tradition

486
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,208
Just like a commie would we all heard it here first

487
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Alex Jones is a,

488
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,840
To be fair the that rule about insurrection

489
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Is in the contacts

490
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
Text of the rules

491
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
The fake rules that skousen road

492
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
It specifically about disenfranchised

493
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,384
Minority and special interest groups

494
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,760
Not getting the idea of its interaction is part of it

495
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,880
Anyway just listed stupid Auntie, this chain email bulshit Bay

496
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,440
Stupid to know

497
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
How many

498
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Well you're you're forgetting the

499
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
4 secret gold

500
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,520
So Alex you know he's saying here that you got

501
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Does globalist plan

502
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
It's being furthered by people like Kelly and

503
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
McMaster

504
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Tillerson and

505
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,808
Nikki Haley at least you stood up against it denotes all to demoralize society as proven by the WikiLeaks

506
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Fake 49ers

507
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
List of

508
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Globalist

509
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Communist plot

510
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
And how it's going to manifest

511
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
How it Hazmat

512
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Manifested

513
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Curses Upon Our Country

514
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,376
What the Alex Reid's coffee just starts

515
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
Discussing going to take these one by one

516
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
After this clip and explain

517
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,104
We already knew what Nikki Haley has come out and said was true

518
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,712
That they would come to her and say Trump is an idiot

519
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Destroy the country

520
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
You've got to help us undermine him

521
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
A Nazi

522
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Comporium

523
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
And block his agenda

524
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
When the globalist have sat here and presided over

525
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
The industrialization of America

526
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
The dumbing-down of America

527
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Life expectancy Plumbing

528
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Plummeting

529
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
Immortality exploding

530
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
And all the other curses that are upon the nation

531
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Trying to undo all that

532
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah Saudi industrialization

533
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
First thing you brings up more complicated of an issue than Alex

534
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
I think and honestly I have no idea what statistics

535
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
To even look into to discuss his point

536
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
I don't know what he defines the industrialization is

537
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
I don't know what data point is going to be like and if you do if you do whenever he gets

538
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,312
Said he'll change his definition it's none do I don't care possible

539
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
I move along I'm not conceding the point now I'm saying irrelevant to the conversation

540
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
Move Along

541
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Concession it is

542
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
The next is the dumbing-down of America

543
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
What does it mean by

544
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,464
Is it based on IQ scores cuz those are the perfect test of intelligence

545
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
And even if they were a January 2018

546
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
Paper in the journal intelligence notes that

547
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
While there were drops in Nordic

548
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,520
IQ scores that have been observed the US was on an upward trajectory Rising point three points.

549
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Plus again IQ scores don't really mean

550
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,688
To demonstrate how dumb this whole conversation is 11

551
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
U2 headlines

552
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
From the Inc

553
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
The website

554
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
The first is quote

555
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
We're all getting Dumber new science proves and no one is sure why

556
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
That was from June 14th

557
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
2018

558
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,816
Flash forward to June 27th 2019 and you get this

559
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,168
Humanity might not be getting Dumber after all new study suggests

560
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,056
A year apart the same publication and both articles were written by the same person

561
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
There's too much

562
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,784
Weird people just have too much, then you got to fill space

563
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
You just got it sometimes you can just let it go man

564
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
In 2018 everyone saw this study about a drop in IQ that was observed in the study of people living in Norway and

565
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Reported it super response

566
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
When more data was in

567
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
It was all whoops

568
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Dumber after all

569
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Every single article I can find that the

570
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,824
Discusses me we're getting Dumber idea as being proven links to that Norwegian study

571
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
And it's all s*** or very least

572
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Woefully oversimplify

573
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,248
If Alex wants to suggest that the population is getting Dumber he needs to

574
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Explain what you mean by that

575
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,136
I'm almost certain that you just read headlines that came out in 2018 about this Norway study

576
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
You haven't cared to read any of the newer information

577
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
The completely contradicted

578
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
And I actually shows the office

579
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,608
IQ scores don't mean anything standardized test scores

580
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,240
I don't think that's early believe is even a good indicator of Intelligence on this on this scale

581
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
You get tattoo even have

582
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,688
A full conversation about the idea that America is getting Dumber you really need to dig into figure out what

583
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
What are your indicators but how do you define intelligence

584
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,392
And I don't think he's equipped to have that

585
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
The kids

586
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
He doesn't want to have a conversation with me like all kids with Tik-Tok I don't even know what it is so life expectancy

587
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Plummeting according to Alex

588
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Talkingshit

589
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,984
In 1970 the life expectancy in the United States was 70.81 years

590
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
In 2016 it was 78.69

591
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
That is not a plumber

592
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,200
Turley speaking life expectancy in the United States is on the upward path it has been for decades

593
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
Are there was a point 15-year drop

594
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
From 2014

595
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
2015

596
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
And you can find plenty of Articles taking this very seriously

597
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
I'm not suggesting they shouldn't

598
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
But I think it would be a little bit much to call that a plumbing

599
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Strong suit

600
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
A suspicion that Alex isn't talking about us

601
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Expectancy

602
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
I think he's talking

603
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
About white people

604
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
A very specific

605
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Group of people

606
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
I believe

607
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Perhaps

608
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Menor wine

609
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
A recent paper in the journal population in developed

610
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Review

611
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,712
Observed life expectancy rates among non-hispanic white Americans

612
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,784
Increasing at a lower rate than the general population

613
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696
They weren't able to pinpoint the exact reason for this but some of the prevailing theories had to do with the opiate crisis killing more Young

614
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Rural White

615
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
People and with obesity levels

616
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Yeah I'm going to go with

617
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
Whatever the exact reason for the phenomenon is you can find articles of headlines that are you know you could just imagine how easily they would

618
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
From Science Daily

619
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,336
Quote for non-hispanic whites in the United States life expectancy Outlook worsens

620
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
From ajmc quote

621
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,480
Study review reveals declining life expectancy among white America

622
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,136
There's some real issues behind this stuff for sure like dealing with what reach researchers called deaths of despair

623
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Like overdose

624
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Suicide

625
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,256
But from listening to as much Alex's I have IP very inclined

626
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
Please read some of these headlines about white life expectancy

627
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Got really mad

628
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
Yeah that was excited life expectancy

629
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Good life

630
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
That's that's my

631
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Especially yeah

632
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640
Infant mortality Alex is saying it's exploding

633
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
It's not according to data from the

634
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
CDC the u.s. infant mortality rate decreased 14%

635
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Between 2007 and 2017

636
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
I have no idea what else is talking

637
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
There are no other curses that are abomination

638
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Alex Jones everything you just said

639
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
In that clip means nothing

640
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
And for the most part it isn't based on any reality

641
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,888
At very best symptom headlines

642
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,680
Does using whatever they made him

643
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,984
Feel fuel

644
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
I'll just the anger that he gets for these

645
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Headlines

646
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
I know a

647
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,016
Lack of critical thinking

648
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
Ease of lion yeah

649
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Is that the percentage of that

650
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160

652
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
You know we got

653
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
These curses that are upon America which don't really see

654
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Seem to be real

655
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
B

656
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Even even if they are real

657
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
America's finally away

658
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Finally waking up

659
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
We're weak

660
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Because of all the curses

661
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
But we're awake okay

662
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,552
Getting clearer and we see what's going on

663
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Define Ali

664
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024

The highest bidder

667
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:10,336
I personally

668
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,040
The only way I can do that is when you spread the word and when you buy the products When you pray for us you do that damn

669
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
Wow

670

Like send me money and you'll get better at allowing me to kill Goblin

677
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104

00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
So

681
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
That was pretty gross

682
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,744
This is how Alex goes out to break

683
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Noticed a weird phrasing that

684
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
He keeps using

685
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
I wonder if you lie think you'll get I don't know exactly where that comes from

686
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
I'm telling you that this whole country

687
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128

For True infowars.com where the defense of human Liberty

690
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,792
So he's he said guard yourself for True a number of times and like I know that's from something I recognize that

691
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Salford

692
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
From Dune

693
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,656
Yeah that's what I like

694
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,984
It has to be from somewhere else

695
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
Is this motorcycle

696
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
Gird yourself he was using

697
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Miss speaking but now.

698
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,456
Yeah the phrasing guard yourself for true so specific

699
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Yeah yeah

700
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
And saying it's insane how many things are just like

701
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
Little little things he's ripped

Frank Herbert

So Alex did that shity I can kill goblins if

711
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240

715
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
Long rant

It is still going on

718
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Everything is not gone

719
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Whatever

720
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
So much is selling out that he

721
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,648
He has to end this sale but he keeps not ending the sale

722
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
It just keeps going on

723
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
I meant and you know it

724
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744

726
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304

727
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
Local affiliate

Give your money to local radio stations

Civilization

732
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672

736
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,680
Is it weighs one part of that if somebody X he gets a cut

737
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
No not what I would

738
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Days that Alex's

739
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,824
Aware that almost nobody would send

740
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Send money to a radio station

741
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Play that errors

742
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
A certain show

743
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,064
And so if you are like working at the radio station right some people even if it's a miniscule amount

744
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
Send money as like I hear thank you for airing Alex's show

745
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,976
Hugely popular show

746
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,816
Much less inclined to take it off the air cuz it went like

747
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,216
In the same way they talk about how like one phone call is equivalent to 100 people in Congress

748
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Congress members

749
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
View that as a as being representative of a much larger

750
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Will think this thing but not

751
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Follow through with it

752
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
You got to assume if you're getting off

753
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Ifucking check

754
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,624
From somebody because they listen to Alex's show at you your radio station that airs it

755
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
And you're still making all the ad

756
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
It'll be like that's got to be a hundred thousand

757
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
F****** people represented by this one check

758
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
And that's probably not true but if Alex

759
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Pinprick like

760
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
No no

761
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
5 people around the country to do that he's got five stations

762
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
She's far more secure

763
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
He would be otherwise

764
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
It's just it just good strategy

765
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
I mean it's sacrilegious

766
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
For sure

767
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Wrong it's wrong

768
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
On a number of levels

769
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
So we get back to this stuff

770
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
About

771
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Nikki Haley

772
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
And

773
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
So

774
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Alex

775
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,328
Is mostly concerned about how people like General Kelly

776
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
And Taylor singing

777
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
They were trying to

778
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
Keep Infowars away from

779
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
What seems to be the spokes

780
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
In this wheel that he's most

781
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Concerned

782
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
And it's because Alex

783
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Broke really

784
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Important stories

785
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Long before anybody else

786
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
This isn't like

787
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
Claiming with a zeitgeist

788
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Zeitgeist

789
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Literally

790
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
With Kelly

791
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:19,584
New York Times Washington Post everywhere but I confirmed the inside the White House it was do not

792
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
Not let him have infowars.com

793
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Do not let

794
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
The president

795
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Talk to people

796
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Dinesh D'Souza

797
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Wow right they tried to keep

798
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
Using the truth

799
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
No

800
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Avista

801
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
Until people show him and he knows we've supposed

802
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Fiona Hill first

803
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
We exposed

804
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Ciaramella

805
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
Hear simultaneously with Mike cernovich

806
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
And

807
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
The Deep state

808
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,080
I had the same sources we learned later they were

809
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Eversource

810
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
I never outsources

811
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
He had quite a few

812
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
Still dies

813
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
It was public

814
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
That

815
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Don Jr

816
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Whatever Alex

817
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Play whatever games you want

818
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,152
So here we have Alex insisting the general Kelly wanted to keep Alex's information away from

819
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
Chop because Alex was just so accurate

820
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,528
Based on the fact that he been yelling about Fiona Hill in the past

821
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,112
And apparently you'd mention Derek's your Mirella ciaramella

822
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:52,256
Which is the name that's being thrown around as being The Whistleblower brought up concerns about Trump's phone call with Ukraine

823
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
President

824
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,352
I'm not sure if that is accurate it very well could be

825
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
I didn't care to look

826
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
But beyond that

827
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
All this is bulshit

828
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
The bigger picture is

829
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,800
Is b******* and I want to parse through this pretty careful

830
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
In terms of Eric ciaramella I can only find references to his name being on the Infowars dating back to November 1st

831
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
29

832
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
And it's based on a tweet from Benny Johnson

833
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,136
Who's the guy who has found a job working with Turning Point USA

834
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,976
And forgetting unceremoniously fired from multiple Publications for play Juris

835
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
He someone has zero credibility

836
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
And whether or not he has the name right about this

837
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
This alleged whistleblower

838
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,912
It's unwise to basic reporting on his face

839
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,520
This is the source that Alex is pretending you some high-level guy

840
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Just some dude at turning point

841
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Benny Johnson Twitter at this guy's name

842
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Old 2 days

843
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,968
Prior to Infowars even having an article about this

844
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,344
It would seem like if the globalist in the White House like Rex Tillerson were concerned about Rogue

845
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Recording like this they would see

846
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
Keep people like Benny Johnson and turning point out

847
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,536
Not people like Alex or just reposting the shity days later

848
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
You've already put out

849
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
An interesting Lee

850
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
They don't

851
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,192
Turning Point USA has a very close relationship with the trumps

852
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
And in fact

853
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
Just the other day they host

854
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Studebaker event for Don Juniors new book triggered

855
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
Which was disrupted by trolls associated with

856
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Straight up white nationalist

857
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Nick Fuentes

858
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
Very very careful about this

859
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,856
It's I hate to to use this sort of

860
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Language

861
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Necessarily

862
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
That's an important

863
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
Things pay attention to the phone on right now

864
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Nick Fuentes

865
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
And his dudes

866
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
2

867
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
The way I would

868
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
Describe it is try to usurp

869
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
Turning Point USA

870
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
Disrupting their events

871
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
And heralding their true conservative values

872
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,896
Which are really just Christian whites

873
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Christian

874
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
More or less

875
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
Took the like

876
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
We need to

877
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
We need to be very aware of that

878
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,416
Cuz it looks like a situation where you like I let them fight

879
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
Yeah yeah but in reality what you have is

880
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,512
A vapid grift

881
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,072
In the form of Charlie Kirk and turning point USA

882
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
Did that what they're doing is

883
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Dumb

884
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
Also full of some racist

885
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,800
Yeah yeah for sure but the diversion

886
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Nick Fuentes

887
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Is involved in its Farm oryx

888
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
That version of

889
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Conservatism

890
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Is way more f***** up yeah

891
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,088
And what he's doing is trying to use Turning Point platform in order to increase his own

892
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Right

893
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
And I think that probably be

894
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Successful because

895
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Well I mean that's why you

896
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,304
They were trying to keep Infowars and

897
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
Dinesh D'Souza inch it away from Trump

898
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,168
Is because you're not supposed to get high on your own Supply

899
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
You can't forget that you're running the game on the roofs

900
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
Because if you start to believe info worship

901
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Senor

902
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
It's it over

903
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
You got that virulent

904
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Conservative

905
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,760
I think this is one of the problem

906
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
That you see

907
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Of

908
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
These things like

909
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Infowars are turning point

910
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
Entirely is that they are really

911
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
Not so when Infowars exist

912
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
As this conspiracy theory

913
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Bulshit

914
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
Entity for really long time

915
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
It leaves it the audience

916
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
And Alex himself

917
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Pray

918
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
For someone like Trump to come along

919
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
You know you have Rodger Stone, and he completely

920
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,968
We validate it's not a hostile takeover necessarily

921
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,552
But you have this thing that's much more powerful than him

922
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Common

923
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
In-N-Out

924
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
Alex has become that

925
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
Turning point is

926
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Pointless

927
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,024
The desert of what would you call it even

928
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,632
Pseudo libertarian values that they express are not appealing

929
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,728
Two college kids they're not appealing to the younger generation

930
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
And so you have this thing

931
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
This entity that

932
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
That is just ripe for the picking

933
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
For someone like Nick Fuentes to come along

934
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
Ayan

935
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Use is trolls

936
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
Whatever

937
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,135
I think it's actually I think it's a pretty dangerous thing

938
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
I think it's

939
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,975
I think I don't I don't know if it'll amount to anything

940
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
But I do think it's something that's important

941
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
For people to recognize cuz

942
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
When we talked about Nick

943
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
He was on Infowars because he

944
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
He disrupted HR guys

945
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Disrupted the Charlie Kirk of

946
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Yeah and

947
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Waldorf

948
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
It's like you might just be talking

949
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,455
There's a clear targeting that's going on by Associates of Nick Fuentes

950
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
Vets are there trying to

951
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Attack

952
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Turning Point

953
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
And it's not because of some

954
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
They're trying to Annex

955
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Turning Point

956
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
And then they're going to use that leverage they're trying to

957
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
Peabody of it but not

958
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
For some better reason

959
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Let's to radicalize

960
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,191
The people who are there to be ratified

961
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
And that's dangerous

962
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Because

963
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,567
Every turning point in

964
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
Worst version of the election

965
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
Trump

966
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Entirely is Jay

967
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
This massive system that has

968
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Has been

969
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,599
Praying upon people and trying to keep them inert

970
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
And

971
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Just trying to fuc

972
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,255
I convinced them of all kinds of things that aren't real

973
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
Will be inevitably taken over by somebody who is simply simply

974
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Simpling

975
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
Who is making the message

976
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Simple clear and pretty

977
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
Tending to stand up for

978
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,359
The worst makeup

979
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
Doubt how like

980
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
What was it that you read some

981
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Great

982
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
That was like

983
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,527
You always end up

984
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
The waves

985
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
Conservative Shirtworks you always

986
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
End up falling Victor

987
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Jump to someone who claims

988
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,207
You're not the real conservative

989
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,279
And they are you're not standing up for True conservative values

990
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
Because that's what you said when you took over right

991
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
It's how it works

992
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
So I'd you know

993
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
Turning Point USA is very deep

994
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Entwined

995
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
And get this

996
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
One of the places that Benny Johnson was fired from

997
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,223
What's the Independent Journal Review

998
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
Before he got fired the ijr was the only media Outlet invited to come along with Rex Tillerson on his tour of a

999
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Asia

1000
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:17,535
Seems like Alex's narrative doesn't make a whole lot of sense here because the guy who outed this alleged whistleblowers name

1001
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
Is a guy who works for turning point

1002
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
And

1003
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,191
Tillerson was involved with the organization that he used to be at and now

1004
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,007
The Trump White House is totally fine with Turning Point

1005
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,079
They're not trying to keep that information away from him

1006
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
That Justin for the wonder why maybe there's another reason

1007
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
So now it's 4

1008
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Fiona Hill

1009
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
That one's a little more

1010
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,855
As you may recall Hill is the former National Security Council official who is testified

1011
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,463
After becoming aware that there was a bit of a quid pro quo situation going on

1012
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
People in the Ukrainian government

1013
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,071
John Bolton told her to lawyer up

1014
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Angie's testified

1015
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
About some stuff

1016
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
And that testimony is going to be pretty important

1017
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
In terms of this impeachment investigation

1018
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Because it's very expensive

1019
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,103
She was in meetings were people like Ambassador sondland words

1020
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Discussing the ship fruity open

1021
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,991
So whatever actually ends up happening on that front it's very important

1022
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
Alex to discredit her as a source of any of her

1023
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
And luckily for him he's already done that

1024
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
On May 31st

1025
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
2070

1026
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,999
Rodger Stone appeared on Alex's show and announced that he'd learned

1027
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:25,631
The George Soros had infiltrated the Trump Administration by installing Fiona Hill into the National Security committee

1028
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
Weirdly she was appointed by Trump himself

1029
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
So I'm not exactly sure

1030
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
I thought you were so many masks

1031
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
I'm not sure how this

1032
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,687
Conspiracy is supposed to have played out in the real world and unfortunately Rodger isn't big on the details

1033
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
I wonder why

1034
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
There's a couple important points

1035
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
The first is that

1036
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,927
Alex and Rodger spent the better part of three years calling literally everyone they disagreed with Soros infiltrate

1037
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
Reince priebus

1038
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,559
Steve Bannon Sean Spicer

1039
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Kushner

1040
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
And Ivanka

1041
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,935
Have all been in the crosshairs is Zoros plants and Globus meddlers

1042
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
At at various points in time

1043
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,775
Alex don't get to pretend that he was Pro

1044
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,895
Prophetic about Fiona Hill eventually testifying about Trump because he said on-air Jesus or rose plant

1045
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Because he calls everyone a Soros

1046
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
Doesn't mean anything that'd be

1047
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
You should have one episode

1048
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
An hour and

1049
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:22,463
Reads off every single name in the in the executive branch entirely just be like

1050
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:28,863
Let's see where we at where at assistant deputy director of the that's a Soros plant

1051
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,239
That way 6 months from now he can be like I told you it was this one

1052
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:40,639
Yep so probably the more important element to this is dating Hill's recent testimony she talked about the real life

1053
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
Impact of Alex and Rodger Zack

1054
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,063
My entire first year of my 10-year at the National Security Council was filled with hate

1055
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Calls conspiracy theories

1056
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,159
Which has started again frankly

1057
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:57,023
As it's been announced that I've been giving this deposition accusing me of being a Soros mole in the white

1058
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,375
She went on to say quote I received I just have to tell you deathrun

1059
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,167
Kohl's at my home

1060
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,239
My neighbor's reportedly reported someone

1061
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Coming and how

1062
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Hammering on my door

1063
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
Jonah Hill's life very

1064
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Well could have been put in.

1065
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,943
Very least and insane level of harassed

1066
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
What was directed at her

1067
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
Directly because of Alex

1068
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
And Rodgers on-air Behavior

1069
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,855
According to her own resume

1070
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
What you can find

1071
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
It's very public

1072
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,719
Do the member of the Central Eurasia project

1073
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
Advisory Board

1074
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
Of the open Society

1075
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Institute from 2,000

1076
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
The 2006

1077
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,655
A good decade before she was appointed to the NSA

1078
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
SE bikes

1079
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Himself

1080
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
That's the connection

1081
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
The Smoking Gun that's enough for people like Alex and Rodger 2.2

1082
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
That's all they need to risk your life

1083
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,735
Because they're so desperate to come up with any kind of rationalization for weather supposed god-king

1084
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Isn't getting anything

1085
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
I'm done

1086
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
You people are vile irredeemable mans

1087
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,695
No one should feel pity for Alex when he has to pay the Sandy Hook families for what he did to

1088
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,791
We should instead feel for the countless other people who will never get any rest

1089
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
Institution for the abuse David subject

1090
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Did you buy Alec

1091
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,167
I don't I don't give a

1092
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
F*** about this

1093
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,287
Because I did all we pointed out that Fiona hill was a Soros

1094
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Plant

1095
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359

Societies

1097
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
Who cares

1098
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:23,295
Who cares choose anybody on the NSC I bet you can find something 2.2 if you want to call them out

1099
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
F****** b*******

1100
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Careers

1101
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
There

1102
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,927
This is how that world works

1103
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
You just jump from weird position to weird position

1104
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
And even if they

1105
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Yeah

1106
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
And if you have a certain

1107
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
Sporty's go finder

1108
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Play it your way somewhere

1109
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Like I I just

1110
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Think

1111
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
It's so

1112
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Insane

1113
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
To look at this sort of thing

1114
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
And recognized

1115
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,615
The real life impact

1116
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
You never hear about

1117
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,735
I do generally wouldn't hear about what Fiona Hills experience was after

1118
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Being targeted by

1119
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,927
Thoughts or whatever you think about it because

1120
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
He does this with so many

1121
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
But

1122
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
There are real-life consequences

1123
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
She had to deal with

1124
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,703
Clearly dachshund cuz if people were calling her home and have someone showed up at her house

1125
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
Like

1126
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Ensure

1127
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
A lot of other

1128
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Conservative Outlet

1129
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,127
We're pushing that she was a Soros mole

1130
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
The traces back to Rodger

1131
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
So that

1132
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
He better do.

1133
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
There's another funny wrinkle to this but

1134
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Have to wait till a little

1135
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,231
Alex Goes to break after yelling about how we broke this Ciara Morello what you did

1136
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
You just

1137
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
F****** posted a tweet

1138
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
MacGyver

1139
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Point

1140
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
And Fiona Hill staffing

1141
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
A prune

1142
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Pointless

1143
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,471
She goes to break

1144
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
When he comes back

1145
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
I think that I did one of the grocer

1146
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
I've heard Alex

1147
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Sixth-rounder main funder of the

1148
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
Helmets

1149
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,063
So Isis

1150
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
Al-Qaeda could jump

1151
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,927
Force between the ambulances

1152
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Mortars and heavy machine guns

1153
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Just got found

1154
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
Almond turkey

1155
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,775
Show called James Bond

1156
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
Found out the James Bonds just a fantasy

1157
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
This is the reality

1158
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
Pushing Daisies now

1159
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
Wonder

1160
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
Wonder what happened to me looks so young and healthy

1161
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
Yelp set all that up to

1162
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
He's not doing too well now

1163
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
So

1164
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
Your phone calls starting next segment

1165
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Gross

1166
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Buck

1167
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,615
First things first the founder of MI6 died in 1928

1168
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,735
The person who Alex is talking about is a guy named James Loomis CA

1169
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,295
Intel was a former officer of the British army

1170
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
And a co-founder of the white helmet

1171
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,719
That's an organization that literally everyone in the world other than Alex and his weirdo friends

1172
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
View as a humanitarian

1173
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,839
At this point it's pretty unclear with the situation

1174
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
About this death

1175
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,031
Sky News was reporting that James's wife told police that she and her husband to taking sleeping pills and gone to bed

1176
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,847
Then later she was awoken by people knocking on her door

1177
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,175
She went outside to find him in the street surrounded by police

1178
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
Haven't fallen off the balcony

1179
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,295
As someone who's taking sleeping pills before I can say that it's

1180
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,855
Entirely possible that he might have had a weird react

1181
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Sleep walked off the

1182
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
That's paws

1183
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
I don't know if that's the case for sure

1184
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,767
But pharmacologically that is a possibility

1185
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:49,887
His wife is also apparently told friends that James had just begun taking

1186
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Can

1187
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
So the possibility of him dying

1188
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
By Suicide

1189
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,799
Is also not totally outside the realm of possibility

1190
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
There's a lot of

1191
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,151
Possibilities of what could have happened

1192
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
But Alex is intact

1193
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Sing like those things are pause

1194
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
He's treating this like it was a murder

1195
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
And he's f****** gloating about

1196
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,135
That's grotesque Behavior no matter what the reality is

1197
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
Alex is acting like this is a murderer because

1198
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,255
He believes that Russia killed this

1199
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,887
This is based on the fact that three days prior to his death the Russian foreign Ministry tweeted Out quote

1200
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:26,239
The white helmets co-founder James limit Serie A is a former agent of Britain

1201
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Am I sick

1202
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Who has been spotted all around the world

1203
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Including in the Balkans

1204
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
And the Middle East

1205
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,687
The proof Alex has for his claim that this dude was MI6

1206
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,759
This is just a Russian foreign ministry's Twitter account

1207
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,599
And because of the street Alex has decided that Russia killed him and Alex's happy

1208
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
About this turn of events

1209
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
I know that I sound like a broken record

1210
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
These modern-day episodes

1211
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,279
But Alex Jones is severely mentally ill

1212
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,839
He's imagining a foreign government killed a man

1213
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
And he's relishing it

1214
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
It doesn't it doesn't get better from here guys

1215
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
Likes get this guy to a

1216
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Yeah that's

1217
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,591
And then just bring him then just bringing McCain up like

1218
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,383
Okay

1219
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Alright

1220
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
So

1221
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
We're just going to

1222
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
Gloat about people dying

1223
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,087
That's what we're doing now that's he's doing

1224
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,415
It's not so outside of his

1225
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,071
No David Rockefeller died he was so celebrating a lot it's

1226
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,607
It's grotesque childish behavior

1227
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Eve needs

1228
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
He needs to figure out

1229
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Yeah he has a lot of work

1230
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
To do on himself

1231
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
While I don't think he has the

1232
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
Emotional capital

1233
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
Everything I read about mysterious

1234
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
He's a cool dude

1235
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,759
Yeah yeah hoo a cool dude

1236
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
I'm not one

1237
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
To pretend that I know

1238
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,903
Lots or at like that I'm an expert in the sea

1239
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,487
Civil War but everything that I can find that isn't

1240
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,119
Ideals this is a humanitarian organization that rescued civilians

1241
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
And we're caught up

1242
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
Battlezone

1243
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
So I don't

1244
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,847
I mean even imagining that he is

1245
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
A bad person

1246
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
This Behavior still no good

1247
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
I just

1248
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
But

1249
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,063
He's also needing me

1250
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Begging you

1251
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
For yourself and your family's future

1252
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,767
Commitment of this broadcast if I wanted to feed these people

1253
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
Please

1254
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Please remember

1255
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,143
But it is only Your Word of Mouth

1256
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
It gets us around the sensors

1257
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,031
Your financial support to fund the operation

1258
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
And only your prayer

1259
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Dino

1260
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,639
Two of us

1261
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
That is your intercession

1262
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,271
That is literally

1263
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
Giving us discernment

1264
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
It's

1265
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
But

1266
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
I need that

1267
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
That

1268
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
Absolutely

1269
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,055
Explain real fast and loose with the Bible here yeah

1270
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,639
So that first versus paraphrasing is Matthew 18:19

1271
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
Which says quote

1272
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:20,319
Truly I tell you that if two of you on Earth agree about anything they ask for it will be done for them by my Father in heaven

1273
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:26,719
You can read that verse and think that you can get a buddy to join you in agreement about whatever you want then God's going to make it so and Heaven

1274
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
Liza painfully dumb reading

1275
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
A text

1276
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,607
If you take the verses that come before this and around it and

1277
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
Context for the book

1278
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Acts it's very clear

1279
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,471
This is about the functions of the early church

1280
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
This is what this is this versus

1281
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Has nothing to do with

1282
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
You know hey

1283
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,871
You know you guys get together

1284
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
We can make my operation

1285
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Functional

1286
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
Yeah we're like what do you want

1287
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:56,159
A pool a pool

1288
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,207
The Department of Treasury up in heaven

1289
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
But what

1290
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
What if we want

1291
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Haven't not to

1292
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,383
The other one siding is closer

1293
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
That one is proverbs

1294
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Going to be outside

1295
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,295
Man chooses his path but God guides our steps

1296
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
Well I was just looking that one up those we can make sure he actually knows what he's talking about Universe future times he wants to cycle

1297
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,255
You should read the rest of proverbs

1298
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,071
16 years versus 27 and 28

1299
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,911
Quote a worthless man digs upheaval in his speech is like a scorcher

1300
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Fire

1301
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
A perverse man spreads dissension

1302
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
Anna gossip divide

1303
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
It's close friends

1304
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Haha

1305
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
I don't understand

1306
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
Maybe he prefer proverbs

1307
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
32

1308
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Quote

1309
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,991
He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior

1310
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,575
And he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city

1311
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,903
I know I remember exactly why I hated reading proverbs

1312
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,183
When I was growing up his cousin

1313
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Real judgy

1314
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,047
We're judging who the f*** are you Solomon

1315
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:09,375
Seems like that is a whole lot in this one chapter of proverbs that Alex didn't

1316
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Seem to absorb

1317
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,215
If I had to bet I bet you saw that f****** verse on a mug

1318
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,751
Oh yeah 100%

1319
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
104

1320
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
Cannot stress

1321
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Strongly

1322
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
Enough

1323
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,455
I do not believe that Alex's

1324
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Ever read the book

1325
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
No

1326
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Not even close

1327
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
In the same way that all his Thomas Jefferson quotes come from like memes and right-wing extremist

1328
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
I bet a lot of

1329
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
Does 2

1330
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,583
Like and the weird servings of extremist reggae

1331
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,143
Christian identity preachers yelling about stuff

1332
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,727
So we got this this whole vibe

1333
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
Going on man

1334
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:54,431
Where you know why is everybody so worried about Infowars until like 8 and obviously answers the Alex's rhetoric

1335
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Answer is

1336
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
Because we revealed

1337
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:02,111
Fiona Hill sharing this whistleblower we we have all this accurate information it all

1338
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,439
Now the real answer is because your behavior leads to

1339
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
Two people's lives being a

1340
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Well yeah

1341
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:13,119
That too that's the real reason the people take this seriously and are like this

1342
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
Probably

1343
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
We should be aware of this

1344
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,983
So Alex

1345
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,543
The idea of people being concerned about what

1346
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
He's doing

1347
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
And then he lists on some good

1348
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,943
The people in Congress

1349
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,735
Price of worried about Trump

1350
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
You say

1351
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,575
Princess Dave

1352
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
Sold out the shy comes and others

1353
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,951
Pretty easy to run

1354
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
We're fighting back

1355
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
Not a bunch of Yes Men

1356
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
Kaleesh

1357
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Congressman Jordan

1358
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Congressman Nunes

1359
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
That's Senators that are up there

1360
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
But the senator from Missouri

1361
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
Charlie Charlie

1362
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
All those guys are fighting hard

1363
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
Alex is trying to remember editor

1364
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,575
Josh Holly's name

1365
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
Got to feel bad for Josh Hawley

1366
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,927
You're from Missouri

1367
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:14,047
Weather at office when I live in

1368
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Hurly-burly

1369
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,935
Hurly-burly I voted for Donovan the Hurdy Gurdy Man

1370
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
Some people call him mellow yellow

1371
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,543
Now as for the other people that Alex

1372
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
Things are good in the house

1373
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,919
Steve scalise once described himself as David Duke without the baggage

1374
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Hey come on now

1375
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
That one's not great but Jim Jordans even worse

1376
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
Just this week it came out that a man who was one of the victims of the Ohio State athletic doctors sexual assaults in the mid-90s

1377
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
Directly reported the ACT

1378
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
To Jim Jordan

1379
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Who is that the school's wrestling coach

1380
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
And Jordan did nothing

1381
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,191
43 man and filed a lawsuit claiming that they were victims of this doctor

1382
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
An

1383
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Investigation that OSU did found that he abused at least

1384
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
177 students

1385
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
In the 20 years that he worked at the school

1386
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,015
Consistently in the past Jordan is tried to claim that he never knew anything about the doctors abusive student

1387
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,855
But this definitely seems to make that sound like b******* especially considering this

1388
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
The second victim

1389
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,183
To say that they directly told Jordan about

1390
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,023
And to be clear this is a much bigger issue than just focusing on Jim Jordan

1391
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
There's a whole system of

1392
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,351
Complicity that needs to be held to account

1393
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:25,727
And the plaintiffs in that case do not deserve for their day in court to be reduced to a political sideshow

1394
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
Please do not

1395
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
Let that busy images

1396
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
My point

1397
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
All that being said

1398
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,199
When Alex has to come up with any politician season 2

1399
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,015
All you can come up with is a dime-store David Duke

1400
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,551
Thrift Shop Joe Paterno

1401
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:43,135
Devin Nunes and a guy from Missouri whose name he doesn't know but remembers

1402
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
It said some f*****-up things that he liked it

1403
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,767
I guess Rand Paul doesn't make a cut anymore

1404
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:55,423
That's not in there anyway that's not making headlines that's not he's not he's somehow a more moderate

1405
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,703
Version of these

1406
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,239
F****** Looney Tunes cat

1407
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,127
It's so not that Alex is like he's going with the guy from Missouri hurdy-gurdy hurt

1408
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,199
I'll come up with Ron Paul's kid

1409
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,039
So I told you that there was going to be another wrinkle

1410
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
2

1411
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
The situation with Alex's coverage

1412
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
Fiona Hill

1413
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
And it comes up in this

1414
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Clip

1415
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
Is Alex accidentally plays the wrong

1416
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
But it's from the same

1417
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Today

1418
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
That Rodger did the Fiona Hill

1419
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Okay

1420
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,727
And it reminded me of something that a lot of people might not

1421
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
It wouldn't

1422
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,031
Jump out and other people's minds

1423
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
Because I'm

1424
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,127
Borderline obsessed with all this stuff it made me laugh

1425
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
So f****** hot

1426
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
Here's Rodger Stone

1427
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,319
In 2017

1428
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Breaking down

1429
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
John Kelly

1430
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
Heather working with Steve Bannon to bring in the Deep state

1431
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,255
Dolly saurus voice

1432
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,583
Ciaramella

1433
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,447
What does Bannon do the leaves in August

1434
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,079
And by October he has a financial deal with qua

1435
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,919
Finance Finance Breitbart

1436
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:16,319
As of the Mercers who I do think our Patriots appeared to be ready to throw in Ontario

1437
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Trump a traitor

1438
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,207
At the same time talking to a snake reporter that he brought into the hen house

1439
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,535
And at the same time using National Security Intel

1440
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,863
To them go basically get money off of somebody

1441
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,727
Protector

1442
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
Historical yardstick

1443
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
This sounds like treason to me

1444
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
Particular clip dealing with

1445
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,455
The eclipse we have

1446
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
Do you want

1447
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:50,111
So on one level that clip was funny to me because once again out to staff can't Vonage

1448
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,671
Play any of the Clip Clips that he wants

1449
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:59,583
He sets up what supposed to be a slam-dunk of Rodger talking about Fiona Hill and this whistleblower and it's just Rodger from that same

1450
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
So talking about Steve Bannon

1451
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
But here's where this gets really

1452
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
You might have heard Rodger say something about a guy named

1453
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Clock in that

1454
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,847
And there's a reference to a man named Miles Kwok

1455
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,687
Having nefarious intentions behind some alleged financing of Breitbart

1456
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
You should know that Miles Kwok soon Rodger stone for defamation for this claim along with a few others like Rodger saying the Quan

1457
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,391
Blockhead can be out with convicted Criminal

1458
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,975
Answers for 100 billion dollars

1459
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,559
On December 17th 2018 Rogers settled that case

1460
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:36,959
Made a public apology and admitted that he repeated lies on Infowars

1461
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,263
He had to pay for three advertisements

1462
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,823
I can get statements in National newspapers

1463
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,479
Part of the story that Alex is currently using to attack Fiona Hill is based on stuff that got Rogers sued

1464
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,039
Invite to him having to buy ads in the New York Times

1465
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
Wall Street Journal and Washington Post

1466
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:58,975
Oh also I hope that re-airing the story doesn't end up getting Rogers settlement agreement void

1467
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
That is hilarious

1468
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
IPad

1469
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
So funny

1470
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,215
That is so goddamn

1471
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,847
Oh God that would that would bring such a smile to my face

1472
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,407
I have all the sudden Alex got

1473
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
But man

1474
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,039
A part of his narrative that Alex is now trying to repurpose because Fiona Hill is

1475
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
Was testifying against

1476
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
Trump

1477
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,159
Impeachment verification

1478
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,535
Part of the original context of it is stuff that got Rodger sued and he had to retract

1479
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,839
They got to figure out a way to like

1480
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,375
Quarantine

1481
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,679
Thanks you know you should

1482
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,727
Yeah well

1483
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Together exactly

1484
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,103
No that's what I'm so now Alex Bri bring it up I think actually could put

1485
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
Rodger in legal Jeopardy if anyone care

1486
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,247
I think you I think you're right I just mean like even if it doesn't

1487
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
Even if it does

1488
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,855
Whatever Alex is repeating of Rogers stuff

1489
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Is all

1490
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
Under the Umbrella of stuff you subtract

1491
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Yeah yeah

1492
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,535
No that's cool enjoy

1493
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,607
Just take all of the days footage

1494
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:15,263
Be like a but a big red x on it with a circle around it

1495
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
Jesus can't do it

1496
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
If we can't put this what guys

1497
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,127
One I don't trust you your s***

1498
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,455
I you know it I know it we've been doing the show for a few months

1499
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
Yeah hey you guys suck

1500
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,295
Yeah so don't touch that no

1501
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
Look at my eyes

1502
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,879
Don't touch the red tapes

1503
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:38,047
If you play this again Rodger might have to pay miles Kwok 100 million dollars so

1504
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
Goddamnit will start

1505
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,287
So I told you the beginning of episode about halfway through were so you'll get to like a very

1506
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,591
Clear reason why I need

1507
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,615
We have to do this

1508
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,663
Here's what it is

1509
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
Alex believes

1510
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,759
That that book that the New York Times is putting

1511
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Where is

1512
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,367
I don't know if the New York Times putting out there with the anonymous

1513
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
It is about that warning about Trump

1514
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
Whatever who cares

1515
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
F*** off

1516
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,839
Alex is convinced that John Bolton

1517
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Wrote the

1518
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
Anonymous book

1519
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
And

1520
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,935
I almost

1521
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Gasp

1522
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
When he told

1523
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
The audience why he believes

1524
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,847
We have the New York Times coming out

1525
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,175
New York Times published

1526
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,735
This Anonymous book the word is

1527
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,551
It's John Bolton we know wants to testify

1528
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Against Z

1529
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
President

1530
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:43,071
Even though there's a separation of powers the president bylaws post able to keep from doing it he wants to go Bare The Faults with it because he's a mean

1531
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,655
Neocon was always a neocon but lied to Trump's face

1532
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
But he would try to carry out the president's agenda

1533
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
The person that

1534
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
We elect

1535
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,103
Book review is a warning Anonymous author makes case

1536
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Against re-election

1537
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,223
Dusty

1538
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,295
I said the John Bolton is today's Benedict Arnold

1539
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
Areas from his YouTube channel

1540
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
Is it.

1541
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
I want to talk about

1542
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,303
Benedict Arnold

1543
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
Holyshit

1544
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,983
Does Alex expect his audience to legitimately have no memory of the side characters in his little play

1545
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,383
How can you play clip from Steve's YouTube page after their unceremonious falling out where Alex decided he was still working for

1546
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,455
CIA doing psyops against Infowars

1547
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,015
By trying to convince Alex at the Las Vegas shooting

1548
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Needham happen

1549
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,599
Legitimately what the f*** is this show

1550
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
Some gases determined to be a

1551
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,695
Deep State spy running operations against diesel

1552
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:47,839
You just put them in time out for a little while

1553
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:53,215
F****** insane know is going to Korea whether or not you actually did

1554
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:01,151
Has he been back on the show and we will get to yook

1555
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
It's not what you think

1556
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,831
That is what happened back when they're falling out happen but Alex gives a little bit more detail

1557
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
About that in a little bit

1558
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,927
Before we get there I want to say this about Steve

1559
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Genic

1560
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
He's a lunatic

1561
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,255
But he's consistent

1562
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,327
Steve pieczenik hates neocon zendesk

1563
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Consistently

1564
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
You consistently tried to

1565
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Alex to be on the same page

1566
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
With no real success

1567
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
He was always there telling Alex

1568
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
Not depressing neocon

1569
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
John Bolton

1570
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,127
But Alex didn't listen

1571
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
He might Rogers don't talk him into being okay with those dudes

1572
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,087
Steve pieczenik is a big old fraud in a con man but I will tip my hat to him for being pretty

1573
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,927
He's crazy and a liar but he has some form of principles

1574
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Which is more than I can say for our

1575
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Like

1576
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,559
How f****** humiliating is it for Alex

1577
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
What to say on his show

1578
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,631
Steven probably still working for the CIA

1579
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
But you didn't

1580
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
Actually work for them

1581
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,495
Done with running psyops on his own audience

1582
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Then allow him back on the show

1583
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,871
Do you think it's possible that Alex just doesn't even remember that he instead

1584
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,223
Steve parted on those bad terms like you because it's not real

1585
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
CIA watches right ones

1586
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,575
That's the that's the rule right so you can

1587
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
And still you know I have no idea

1588
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Alex

1589
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:22,047
He knows that none of the stuff that he talks about his real so obviously the fight between him and Steve about like how he's probably still run

1590
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,887
Psyops

1591
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:31,519
Imagined it the way that I I saw the whole breakup

1592
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
Was

1593
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,127
Something behind the scenes where Steve is like

1594
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:40,991
I want to say thanks for both legs in Alex's like we can't do it the heat is on me right now

1595
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,831
Don't do that might be better was a false flag

1596
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
I told you not to say that on my f****** show that might actually be correct and then they stopped talking for a while and

1597
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Then you know

1598
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:55,583
He creates the whole I'm making up a deep State narrative and then

1599
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,655
Possibly true

1600
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
But Alex wants Steve back

1601
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
Call Michelle

1602
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Why

1603
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,759
Mole The Honorable person they are timeshares

1604
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,135
Steve

1605
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,999
So the collars really wants Steve back on he goes to a call this collar

1606
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,559
Okay and then Alex explains

1607
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
WhatsApp

1608
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,959
It's amazing to hear Steve pieczenik on your on your program again it's been awhile

1609
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Alex

1610
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
You want to come on he's refused to come on the show

1611
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
He's refused to come on the show well I think everybody you know everybody should know you took a lot of sleep a lot of flak

1612
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:50,111
Dino because doctor Steve was the one who originally in a brought up the idea that there could be

1613
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:54,207
Some kind of ulterior motive with Sandy Hook and you know what

1614
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
Call those press people that

1615
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,655
You know that that say that they protect their other sources I mean you're actually that guy Alex you're the one

1616
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:06,239
That didn't say put anything on Doctor Steve you know you

1617
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,079
You protected doctor Steve in admired that about you man

1618
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
I and

1619
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,391
He's a coward. Put a lot of heat coming on

1620
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,463
You can call it a federal court has been called into federal court

1621
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
On other things that were said on the show so there's a lot of stuff behind the scene

1622
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,655
Still speaking out and saying horrible things that I agree with

1623
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
And so

1624
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,055
Yeah he's been a source on many things we have a lot of mother

1625
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
Sources

1626
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
One day

I mean he's a bitter angry old man sitting alone in his f******

Jesus

01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,607
I know from listening to the show that they they are fighting

1641
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
Existed before the break

1642
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,287
I want Alex called him in the middle of a hurricane

1643
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
It started but that wasn't the end of it

1644
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
Steve appeared after that

1645
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
It was the last appearance

1646
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
Was

1647
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,759
That's surrounding the Las Vegas shooting

1648
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
Alex

1649
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,367
Haven't callers call in and say I think Steve's probably still working

1650
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,463
In psyops and I was like that that's fair to say probably

1651
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,999
I'm back on anymore so

1652
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,279
When I hear that

1653
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,351
I mean obviously none of the stuff that Alex talks about his real

1654
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,631
Nor is any of the stuff

1655
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
Steve pieczenik

1656
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Absolutely not

1657
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
So what you

1658
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,055
Her left with is they probably did have a fight behind the scenes

1659
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:21,407
About whatever Petty nonsense Alex making him hold or or

1660
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
Baby it is not letting

1661
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:28,319
Play Everything is fake and then Alex on are the way he talks about it is

1662
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,623
He's probably still working for the CIA

1663
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,719
So you have that lie to cover up just a petty disagreement

1664
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Between two

1665
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Liars

1666
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,607
And it's clearly now that shows that would have

1667
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,143
Now that you put it that way then

1668
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,703
Yeah it is 100% a petty

1669
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Bull Shed

1670
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,799
Clearly it has something to do with one of them talking

1671
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,359
On the phone with him having an argument I'm being like

1672
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
You know what

1673
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
I don't need you and Alex being

1674
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
I don't need you

1675
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,599
You know you want to kind of believe that Alex believes that Steve is working in psyops and that's like

1676
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,695
It's more interesting but the reality is all of that is window dress

1677
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,511
That's all just that's a narrative in it of its

1678
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Where is the reality is

1679
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,351
Just got into a fight with this old man

1680
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
That is not as much fun

1681
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
Not the place where you

1682
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:24,383
Shoving you have a bunch of people calling into being like where is Steve we want more Steve

1683
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
You can't be like

1684
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
No

1685
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Yeah

1686
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,783
Yeah

1687
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:35,903
Coward bitter assholes who lives in f****** Florida A1A back on

1688
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:42,047
He's got a standing invitation so anyway the reason that we have a little bit of the 12th is because Alex said open invitation

1689
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,631
Steve come on tomorrow come back on tomorrow

1690
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Any dozen

1691
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
So we just have a couple

1692
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
You know what if I were better at

1693
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
Maybe he does

1694
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,567
Spoiler alert

1695
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,127
We have a few clips from the 12th I thought were still like

1696
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Yeah yeah

1697
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
So Alex gets another caller wants to talk about chemtrails

1698
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
And

1699
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,855
Not much like

1700
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,439
I don't know how to set up this Cliff I just thought it was really

1701
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Insane

1702
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,511
Remember you staying

1703
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
And really

1704
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,103
Even though

1705
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
Everything more receptive

1706
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
Frequency

1707
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
Controller the cybernetic control.

1708
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Borrow

1709
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
Ulf to everything

1710
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,463
So what did I tell you in Transcendence with Johnny Depp

1711
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:46,047
That is in the sky

1712
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Smart.

1713
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,655
A whole computer system

1714
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,727
Smartphone

1715
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
In a single molecule

1716
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,639
Will be everything and absorb us and that's the endgame playing where you can't escape

1717
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Already putting the

1718
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,503
Binary weapon system in the Dockside

1719
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:11,647
The other system

1720
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Binder that

1721
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,255
I've been through the 678g they're already rolling out and test

1722
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:20,095
Program

1723
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
Actually kill you Friday

1724
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:25,727
As we learned in

1725
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
Why would you be working on

1726
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
If you haven't got

1727
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Or five really

1728
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:39,295
I hope you all just like listen to that and think 41

1729
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,855
That's that's on the level of

1730
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,951
They want gold was going to bring back Gladiator games to decrease the population

1731
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
Johnny Depp movie I like papers

1732
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Transcendence

1733
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,983
Starring Johnny Depp right ice I found that Johnny Depp DVD in the WikiLeaks

1734
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
The f*** out of here

1735
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,847
So anyway I was has a gas it's not Steve

1736
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Pieczenik

1737
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
And it's

1738
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Also not Glenn Danzig

1739
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,735
But he was a lead singer of the Mist

1740
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,807
Oh okay well I got any Michael Graves

1741
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,183
Later singer that's when they got they came back

1742
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Hyundai

1743
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,815
I regret to inform you that this guy is very dumb he's not as smart as Danza

1744
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,375
I don't know I've never heard Danzig on Infowars

1745
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,935
That's true. So I can't really judge

1746
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,007
For what I know about Danzig he's actually pretty cool f****** dudes

1747
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,799
I don't know enough to say

1748
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,079
I like the name Danzig

1749
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
Its course sure

1750
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,151
But this guy is

1751
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Wolf

1752
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,223
Listening to him

1753
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Tough

1754
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,599
So it's you prepare for 4 today and and

1755
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,415
I went to infowars.com

1756
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
And

1757
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,999
There's the report of about Rodger Stone

1758
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,583
Steve Bannon and and yourself and

1759
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,447
He references and talks about miles Kwok who is this Chinese

1760
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
National

1761
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,311
Who is China's looking to

1762
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
Expedite

1763
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,151
Factor for his

1764
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
For his crime

1765
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,271
Steve Bannon Steve Bannon

1766
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:18,623
Was it was basically infiltrating the

1767
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,951
The Trump campaign for his for his own game

1768
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
And then I started to think about

1769
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,095
Chess board

1770
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,167
This is legitimately look at Rodger Stone suit

1771
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
Like this

1772
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,799
Literally just talking about these conspiracy theories about miles Kwok

1773
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,663
They get Rodger Stone soon hopefully Michael Graves doesn't naugahyde man

1774
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Irene

1775
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,527
He was also talking about them in a in a manner of taking his sweet f******

1776
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
In time about it as well

1777
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,367
That is a long and

1778
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:55,231
Obviously I have no issue with the stuttering at all but that was stupid

1779
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
It's very dumb

1780
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,815
The thoughts are very stupid

1781
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,655
The exact I Was preparing for this episode and so I watched something

1782
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,959
It got Rogers sued and he had to retract

1783
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,287
So only reason to watch that is with that

1784
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Context of

1785
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,359
The interesting element of it is

1786
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
He got sued

1787
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,919
Yeah like

1788
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:18,015
Look for signs of awareness that he's lying because he is

1789
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
That is so funny

1790
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,855
That is so funny that you're

1791
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:25,695
You're coming on the show and you're coming in pretty

1792
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,231
It seems like he's coming in Fairly Bland

1793
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
Like he's not a regular Infowars listener

1794
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
Surgeon

1795
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:37,471
He actually last year got kicked off a festival because he

1796
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,287
Some social media posts supporting Alex Jones

1797
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
Like really aggressively about like

1798
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:53,855
When did the Nazi punks you guys not miss anymore

1799
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,415
I don't know exactly why I didn't 100

1800
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Didn't care to look at that

1801
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:02,047
His trajectory or anything but I did find a story about him getting kicked off his back

1802
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,119
Asiana I imagined it in my head is

1803
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
He's coming on the

1804
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,703
Skyrim the business

1805
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:14,080
And he just happens to listen to one episode to prepare to go on the show

1806
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,640
And he just happened to remember the one part

1807
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,968
That is the only part of that episode that is literally across

1808
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:24,576
He's a fan and he still made that still went to the crime okay

1809
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,416
The problems of Alex's rhetoric is that like

1810
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:34,816
In Infowars World Rodger Stone didn't get sued for this

1811
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,912
So why would the Ottomans

1812
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:46,080
Read it in the f****** Wall Street Journal no they did not Infowars post an article about

1813
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,152
Rodger Stone him to admit that he peddled lies

1814
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,224
So anyway this guy again

1815
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,016
Does misfit singer very stupid

1816
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:58,624
Start talking about the lawyer for the alleged whistleblower

1817
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
Ciaramella

1818
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,232
And it's just kind of a thing that Alex has been going on this

1819
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
This entire show

1820
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,072
I think this is okay article

1821
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,960
If you are everything that is on the chessboard and I went down the rabbit hole starting with

1822
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,520
Mark

1823
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,824
The whistleblower's lawyer

1824
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,640
This guy that has pictures of of himself

1825
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
At Disney World

1826
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,200
Is clearly

1827
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
Link to some sort of child

1828
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,416
A hundred percent

1829
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,280
And it's and it's still up on Twitter for everybody to see

1830
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:42,144
So this guy Mark Zaid is the lawyer for The Whistleblower complaint

1831
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,912
Against Trump

1832
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
For most of the show Alex

1833
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,008
Has been peppering in references to him being a pedophile

1834
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
Based on a tweet where he says that he's has gotten

1835
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Security clearances for people

1836
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,384
Who have c*********

1837
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,456
Alex and now the former lead singer

1838
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,016
Are the Misfits seem to think that he's just bragging

1839
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,088
But they don't take into account that that's not just something he tweeted

1840
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
It's a reply to another

1841
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,696
The original tweet is from Slate

1842
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,280
With that with it's a link to an article about how Rob Porter

1843
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
Former Trump White House staff secretary

1844
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,168
Was able to get security clearance even though he's been accused of domestic

1845
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,216
By both of his ex-wives

1846
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,752
In context

1847
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:24,128
Clear that saves comment is about how a lot of things don't actually preclude people from receiving security clearance

1848
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
It seems more like a

1849
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,736
You think that's bad kind of comment more than any

1850
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Hangouts

1851
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,784
So they're twisting that

1852
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
So another thing that Alex points do is

1853
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,672
Zaid made from August 29th 2019

1854
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,024
And Alex is claiming it it's him bragging about knowing Jeffrey Epstein

1855
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:47,424
The Tweet is a link to an article with the headline quote Jeffrey Epstein's little-known lawyer lands in the spotlight

1856
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
Zaid commented quote

1857
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,568
Not sure if being a little note a little-known lawyer is a good thing or bad

1858
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,384
Though associated with Epstein probably a good thing

1859
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,992
This is being taken to mean that Zada saying that associated with Epstein is a good thing

1860
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
That's what Alex is saying

1861
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
Which is a terrible reading of the tweet

1862
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,880
Now he's saying that for this lawyer

1863
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,464
If he's associated with Epstein being little-known is a good thing

1864
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,768
That article in the Wall Street Journal is

1865
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,792
Not about Zaid

1866
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:17,376
But another lawyer I mean they're better

1867
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
There's a better sentence

1868
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,216
Alex Wolff

1869
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,264
You know what maybe he's not wilfully mystery

1870
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,056
Maybe you just is

1871
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,640
That incapable of reading it's not a poorly constructed

1872
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,456
If you it's very easy to follow if you're not a f******

1873
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
I know

1874
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
That's what I'm so

1875
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,808
As for this guy taking pictures at Disney

1876
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
Who knows

1877
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,648
Maybe he's got a family ain't no f****** idea

1878
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,208
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that this guy definitely

1879
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:46,048
Isn't a major Cog in the globalist blood-drinking child ring

1880
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:49,888
The evidence being presented here is not what I would call convince

1881
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,984
I really expect more from the non Danzig lead singer of Vista

1882
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
Yeah

1883
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,824
Also the bigger picture problem for

1884
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,384
Exist here without his narrative surrounding

1885
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
Pedophiles in general

1886
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,200
I generally try not to

1887
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,272
How to cover the side of Alex's rhetoric too much because I feel even.

1888
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,552
Construction of it is toxic

1889
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,344
And I really really

1890
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
Hey what he does

1891
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
About this

1892
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Sore topic

1893
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,488
However I need to point out one gigantic problem with

1894
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
His beliefs

1895
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,424
We know that I was believed there's a gigantic globalist blackmail ring where the evil blood-drinking globalist keep their politic

1896
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,960
The media figures online

1897
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,008
With threats of revealing that there pedophile

1898
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,616
We also know that I don't believe that the globalists are trying to normalize pedophilia

1899
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,408
Would you scream spot all the time

1900
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,016
From lies about NAMBLA being a un organization to screaming about articles in

1901
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,368
Salon two lies about the lgbtq community adding a p

1902
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,184
Do his disgusting rhetoric surrounding drag queen story time

1903
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,720
It's very very

1904
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
Constant

1905
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,584
As a thread of his rhetoric that they're trying to normalize pedophilia

1906
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,400
Now the problem with these things are

1907
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
That they both

1908
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,216
Cannot be true at the same time

1909
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,056
Is a globalist accuse pedophile blackmail to maintain their power

1910
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,360
The last ever do is

1911
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
Normalize

1912
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
Pedophilia

1913
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,200
The second they achieve normalization

1914
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:12,832
Instantly lose literally all control they ever have had over Politics the media or the economy

1915
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,136
To put it bluntly these two things are

1916
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,672
Opposition

1917
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:19,744
And no evil organization would ever pursue both

1918
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,560
But you know what kind would know kind of organization would

1919
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,912
Fictitious

1920
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,984
I can guarantee you that that's no offense

1921
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
Yeah

1922
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
F*** this guy

1923
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,872
Misfits just buy

1924
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Extension

1925
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,664
Danzig

1926
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:44,576
I'm not going to say either way

1927
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,368
Danzig murder in

1928
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,464
So the Misfits lead singer guy has some other stupid thoughts

1929
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,304
And he's also connected to the James Madison project

1930
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,120
It's talking about the whistleblowers lawyer show

1931
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
Which

1932
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:03,520
Also on the board of the James Madison project that's connected to John podesta

1933
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:09,920
Which connected to the Center for American progress which is connected to the Southern Poverty Law Center

1934
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,480
Connected to the ACLU funded by

1935
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,016
George Soros

1936
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:18,624
We got him

1937
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,928
Not true but this is a fun game

1938
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,976
We got this is a fun game so I want to play

1939
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,280
So this lawyer right he's involved with

1940
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,816
The James Madison project

1941
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,168
Guy named David Kahn is also one of the board members of the James Madison project

1942
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,984
Khan started a journal called cryptologic

1943
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,288
Which is put out by Rutledge publishing

1944
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,336
Which was founded by George Rutledge

1945
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:43,712
Who distributed many of the writings of Benjamin Disraeli who is seen as the founder of British cancer

1946
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
Because it will just let us to Boris

1947
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
Johnson

1948
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064
So he must clearly be in on the conspiracy

1949
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,904
I wish I could refute you but that checks out

1950
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,536
I feel like that one got away from me a little bit so I want to try again

1951
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,120
The Fred summer dragons

1952
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,400
You need a better come

1953
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,216
In between Israeli and John

1954
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,776
Another board member is Thomas Sussman

1955
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,336
Who is a partner at the law firm ropes & Gray

1956
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,640
You know who else was a partner at ropes & Gray

1957
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,920
Jean Willis

1958
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:19,808
Who was also a member of the famous MIT blackjack team whose story was turned into that movie 21

1959
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,880
Which star Jim Sturgess who was also in the movie

1960
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,696
Cloud Atlas which store has probably had something to do with

1961
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:30,560
Seems like a globalist movie Emmanuel a better

1962
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
You got Envy's better than George Soros probably had something to do with cloudy like a globalist movie

1963
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,496
Wanted to talk about Cloud at

1964
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:43,616
Maybe not that movie this is stupid s*** and again I expect more from my rock band lead singer

1965
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:50,272
I forgot I also regret to inform you this interview does not get better

1966
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:55,648
Six Degrees of Soros game video

1967
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
But

1968
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,512
I do expect more from people who sound like

1969
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Eddie Bravo

1970
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
Got to stop it

1971
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,424
So this is pretty funny because Alex

1972
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,264
He's like I got the lead singer here guy from The Misfits

1973
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,824
Come back from break with a with a sitter

1974
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:20,480
Hollywood Babylon and now Hollywood

1975
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,392
Danzig

1976
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:35,328
Yeah but it's it's a reminder that he's not dance

1977
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
He did not help

1978
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:42,752
There's no way in that arrows album

1979
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,288
Probably

1980
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
So anyway

1981
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Geico

1982
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
Hates Hillary Clinton

1983
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Enza

1984
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,600
They need to discredit the Liberty Movement remember what what Hillary Clinton said

1985
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,392
Remember what she called us

1986
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,696
Irredeemable the Portables

1987
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:08,096
When you look up be redeemable the definition of irredeemable is is is not a distinct directions

1988
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:14,752
And I actually and I I looked it up if you want no value can't fix deserving Strong-Tie

1989
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:20,640
Condemnation shockingly bad in quality we were talking about Auschwitz were talking about camps before

1990
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:25,248
That was that was when going to watch what's going to happen

1991
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,552
When somebody like Hillary Clinton

1992
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
And her minions

1993
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Get

1994
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,904
Control

1995
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,464
When they when they when they seed control back

1996
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:38,048
And push what what they are trying to do

1997
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
It really is camps

1998
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,168
It's coming to get us

1999
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:47,520
Has the word irredeemable I guess

2000
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:49,824
Record that

2001
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,432
So congratulations we made a lap and this guy still back on that so

2002
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:57,760
I'm thrilled for him cuz he didn't get the earlier

2003
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Shows

2004
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,296
I swear Alex

2005
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Onboard

2006
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:04,672
Well for like people you're coming

2007
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,208
We're not white people

2008
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,512
Gotcha gotcha

2009
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
We good it is good

2010
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,864
Yes but only if he must do that to White

2011
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
Conservative Ghana

2012
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
It's good

2013
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:21,568
4 people who were born a couple of miles away from the border

2014
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,128
Be okay with a fever

2015
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:28,480
Human rights are arbitrary

2016
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,504
Veterinary

2017
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,784
So this guy

2018
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Infinitely

2019
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,856
He's read a lot about World War II

2020
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,696
Oh no he's not allowed to which is a good start to a sentence

2021
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:42,816
But where it goes this guy should not be allowed to read about WWII

2022
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:47,680
I read a lot about about World War I

2023
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,216
The death camps in Denver

2024
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:55,616
One of the things that I find when you when you when you read about that history when you read about the p

2025
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,896
People that were involved in that

2026
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:03,296
It's always the same thing that people in these communities in the Jewish communities at work that were sort of falling removed from the

2027
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,256
Concern next thing you know they were on a train

2028
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:16,096
Headed to a death camp because George Soros

2029
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:21,472
Was 14 he was a bloodhound he was able to find block

2030
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
But he brought them out

2031
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,824
Time in his life

2032
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:30,432
The happiest time in Essex

2033
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
I have

2034
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Like

2035
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,760
Is it

2036
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
Perhaps the most open-and-shut case for defamation

2037
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,368
For Alex

2038
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,928
Related to his Soros

2039
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,464
Yep the fact that he is

2040
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,000
Now escalated this

2041
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,400
Strong like his original rhetoric which is just as vague ideas about he's a Nazi collaborator now he's

2042
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
Turned it into very consist

2043
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:57,312
Only saying that he would actually use a bloodhound and he had to go around and hunt out Jews and report them

2044
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,384
The fact that he says this on his own show

2045
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,712
And would go on Joe Rogan show and say

2046
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,016
When you get to push back when broken

2047
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:10,112
That's not true that's not what this interview that he did says

2048
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,416
But Alex says on Rogan show

2049
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952
It's an open question

2050
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,976
That is proof

2051
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,560
Malice that is proof of actual Lounge

2052
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:21,632
So if George Soros wanted to destroy Alex

2053
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,680
He has him anytime he wants it

2054
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,472
Please do it

2055
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,288
I think that this is one of the

2056
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,360
Examples of the benevolence of Alexander

2057
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,176
Yeah

2058
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,456
The world but

2059
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
Towards Alex

2060
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,296
He is living on borrowed

2061
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
Time

2062
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:47,488
1025 f****** years you know before you went on Rogan should I think will be very difficult

2063
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,512
Go to demonstrate

2064
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
He doesn't

2065
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,072
Or that he knows that what he saying is

2066
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
Ride like the fact

2067
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,888
But you kind of have to prove

2068
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
That someone knows what they're saying isn't

2069
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:00,544
Right with public figures with George Soros definitely would be

2070
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,104
Do not forget you have to reach that state

2071
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
Standard

2072
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Matt

2073
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,296
George Soros doesn't decide to do that Alex

2074
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:16,416
You are you are f*** I think I think Barnes

2075
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,400
2 Chainz I'm going to own Infowars

2076
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:29,216
Steph so that's the end of the 11th step cuz it

2077
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
It's mostly I'm just talking to

2078
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,520
Misfits guy Morin

2079
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
He is very dumb

2080
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,152
So we have a little bit here from the 12th cuz I was listen

2081
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
Cuz I wanted to see if Steve was going to come on

2082
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,736
Cuz that is very relevant

2083
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
Yeah there's no way we could have

2084
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,064
Listen to this episode

2085
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,368
So today and then been like well we'll try and see

2086
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,720
What mean we're recording is on the 12th so it's very difficult for me to listen

2087
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
To All of Me

2088
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,792
And then turn around and have an episode

2089
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,072
But I would have done it

2090
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,120
Finally have to even

2091
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,704
But most of it I probably would have just

2092
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,008
Ignore cuz it's all just gone for yours

2093
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
Paranoia

2094
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
Alex

2095
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Some things are like

2096
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,592
Map

2097
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
I got to cut a clip of a

2098
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,152
Because Alex

2099
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,944
Are you saying that there's

2100
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,736
Space wars going on

2101
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,016
People just can't handle it

2102
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,976
I was just shaking

2103
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,536
Tell you that

2104
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:28,608
This level of conflict is only the surface

2105
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,424
Conflict is a Olaf

2106
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,216
We even know

2107
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,264
A lot more serious

2108
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,312
What you say the universe is a variable

2109
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,128
In place and there are some big Wars going on with John

2110
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,432
Weed

2111
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,992
Schrock know that's level because

2112
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Understand

2113
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,160
That doesn't seem that different from Project Camelot s*** to me

2114
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,232
That sounds like he's saying that there's space wars

2115
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,000
Going on

2116
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
I

2117
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,608
I think God leads us in the space wars literally

2118
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,912
Saying that there are Wars going on

2119
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
In space

2120
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,520
They are out there are space wars

2121
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,568
He's not doing any he's

2122
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,104
He said God me the

2123
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,640
But if this isn't

2124
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,664
This isn't him

2125
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
Talk about

2126
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,968
Like Heaven and Hell Wars

2127
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
This is him being like

2128
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,552
We need to get off this rock

2129
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:22,368
The planet to join Wars

2130
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
In space

2131
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
The universe

2132
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,952
So I'm going

2133
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,488
Going to go with he believes

2134
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
That his fictitious

2135
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Enemies

2136
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
Know that he is

2137
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:34,144
Pierce the veil of human consciousness

2138
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,728
And is capable of let's say viewing

2139
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,752
Remote

2140
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,312
Wars happening around

2141
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,080
The universe

2142
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:47,456
And that they are on the side that is bad in the space wars

2143
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,808
Much like the reptilians

2144
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:58,208
Smells that we have Raptor allies in space

2145
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,488
And God is involved

2146
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
It's not that different.

2147
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
And whatever

2148
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,120
I'm sure has a telescope

2149
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:06,912
I believe that too

2150
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,960
So just after that

2151
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,776
After he's talking a little bit about space wars

2152
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
He talks to a caller

2153
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,104
And this guy

2154
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
This guy's f***** up

2155
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,944
What else you think we should do I mean

2156
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,552
Because it's a spiritual fight

2157
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:29,440
It is a spiritual battle and end the reason why is because the Christian people

2158
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,000
Permitted a lot of things to have

2159
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
By controlling the language they

2160
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
You think

2161
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Controlling your

2162
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
Control your actions

2163
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,448
Precedes action

2164
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
Gullible

2165
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,800
And then whatever you allowed to happen

2166
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,664
It was a time in history of it when Christians control this this Arena so power

2167
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,456
The Cockroaches like this

2168
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,480
People have to live

2169
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:55,808
In the shadows and do their business in the shadows and under the cover

2170
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
Darkness now it is in plain sight

2171
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,136
It isn't daylight

2172
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,672
And there is not enough good Chris

2173
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,976
Is that our calling and exactly what they are

2174
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Richard demon

2175
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,792
And they need to be hunted

2176
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,072
Pound

2177
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,144
And a politically assassinated is what they need to be

2178
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,704
Absolutely brother

2179
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,848
Call Rochelle soon

2180
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,200
Awesome thank you

2181
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:28,832
So this caller is expressing political assassinations are needed for our Rivals

2182
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
And they've been allowed to run around because

2183
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Is Christian

2184
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,440
Aren't in control

2185
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:37,280
Strongly enough anymore and I was just

2186
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,584
Right on this diatribe

2187
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,888
I want him on 24

2188
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,264
I mean I also think that there's probably a mean there's really no

2189
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
Difference but there is

2190
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,848
A linguistic difference

2191
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:55,456
Between these people need to be assassinated

2192
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Yeah

2193
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,832
There's a contextual

2194
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,392
That I think makes what this guy saying

2195
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,928
I think he's trying to play Alex

2196
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,208
Little birthday

2197
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,488
But what are you saying

2198
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Credibly scare

2199
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,328
These people are so f***** up

2200
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Cannot engage

2201
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,120
Gauge with anybody

2202
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
There was a time

2203
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,936
Just like

2204
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,472
F*** you give me

2205
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,520
Give me specifics of go f*** you

2206
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:24,128
So Alex does have a guest on the 12th and it was disappointing

2207
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
Because it wasn't C4 Janik

2208
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
But it was

2209
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
The Misfits

2210
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,248
Again

2211
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,296
No is in Austin for a little bit

2212
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,136
But Alex

2213
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:35,904
Another guess

2214
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,208
And it's Stewart Roads of the oath

2215
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,256
Who is going to be the next

2216
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,536
Cigarettes

2217
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
Goodnight

2218
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,096
So

2219
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,376
In his appearance

2220
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
Stewart is

2221
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:50,240
Really expressing some ideas that are going to lead towards

2222
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,264
Violence

2223
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,288
Quite honestly

2224
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
Express

2225
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,104
Hear that Trump was the last

2226
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,128
Peaceful option

2227
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:02,528
No through the firewall the way through over the last was last you do last effort to try to do this peacefully

2228
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,064
Is a firewall

2229
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,440
But they can't let that play out here to remove him from whatever means necessary

2230
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:13,024
24th Amendment he saw that were psychiatrists now

2231
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:18,400
Ask him to testify in front of the front of the house

2232
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:22,496
Under the gold Waterworld

2233
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,592
Friday 13th

2234
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,128
Warfare

2235
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:34,528
You don't know that we've done all we can replicate it in some ways been having any restraint what don't you do this

2236
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,208
Any physical response to look not your property

2237
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:45,792
Stuart said there at the end

2238
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:51,424
And we've done everything we can so we can not feel bad about having no restraint with our violin

2239
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,960
Yep that but that's

2240
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,752
Been there Point all along

2241
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,848
This is a note this is what they were saying in 2013 to

2242
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,896
Like they've always been right on

2243
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Cusp of doing so

2244
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
Violence app

2245
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,272
I don't I don't know if that makes me think that it's

2246
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,552
Less likely that the

2247
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,576
These people will do anything

2248
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,624
Or more like

2249
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,952
Eventually the dams got a break like that you know

2250
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,768
Well I mean it's not like people who would listen

2251
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,792
Link to this didn't

2252
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,632
End up going out and doing things right

2253
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,472
I don't know what I think

2254
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
But I know that

2255
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
This weird thing is

2256
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,336
I read the thing that I'm

2257
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,128
Getting so much cuz it

2258
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,408
Ties back into

2259
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,200
So many of these guys have

2260
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,784
Well if we're going to do it we better do it while Trump's in

2261
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,112
That's what I'm saying

2262
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,416
Like that idea is that there

2263
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,488
There's not going to be a civil war

2264
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,560
If there's going to be a civil anything is going to be a civil f***

2265
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Manslaughter

2266
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
And

2267
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:58,496
The difference is going to be if Trump is in the white house and we start that Slaughter then maybe Trump will let us get away with it

2268
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
And give us our f***

2269
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
Can cover for it

2270
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,360
Or if Trump is not in office

2271
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,408
Then we're going to be in Insurgent

2272
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,224
We're the ones who are going to get fuc

2273
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,552
Yeah so then it'll be good people on both sides

2274
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
Yeah yeah

2275
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,368
So

2276
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,416
At the end of that last clip

2277
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,208
Stewart saying f*****-up thing

2278
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,536
About like hey we can hope we're free to commit violence

2279
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
We've done everything we can

2280
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,352
And Alex brings up

2281
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,376
They're going to pull false

2282
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,144
Flags to make

2283
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Our violence

2284
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,728
Look for something

2285
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Roy

2286
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
And when he gets back from break

2287
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,848
Alex says something that I find like

2288
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
Deeply disturbing

2289
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:38,688
Well obviously conservative would never going to Walmart and shoot

2290
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
Innocent

2291
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,248
White black Hispanic people

2292
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,648
Could Adam Lanza

2293
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:55,072
Patriots not saying do this wood would wood would go after globalist and Peep

2294
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
It's not us

2295
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,240
This is being staged

2296
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,664
What Alex is doing here is trying to pull off some kind of bizarre no true Scotsman fallacy

2297
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,248
The argue that any instance of violence not perfect

2298
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,552
Score boost can't possibly be Patriots in

2299
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,600
Conservative and therefore must be aunt

2300
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,392
Fascist false flag into paper

2301
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:24,000
The wave is basic fallacy works is to serve as a protection of a group

2302
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Purity

2303
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:30,656
Alex you find a story about let's say right-wing individual killing a bunch of innocent civilians

2304
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,728
It is responsible no true conservative would do something

2305
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,288
So he would conclude that this person wasn't

2306
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Really are conserved

2307
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,616
That's the basic version where the function is

2308
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:42,944
To maintain the image of what a conservative is in his mind

2309
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,528
Despite evidence that the group includes people who fall short of the definition

2310
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
People do this sort of thing all the time

2311
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,880
And on some level it's part of human instinct

2312
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
To protect our own identities as being part of a group

2313
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:59,072
It's hard to reconcile that you might be a member of a group that also includes people who you find morally repulsive

2314
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,608
But that's sometimes the case

2315
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,936
This line this line of fallacious thinking

2316
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,752
That's how a lot of people ignore that internal conflict

2317
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,056
But what Alex is doing is taking

2318
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
Bad thinking

2319
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,384
He's engaging it one step further than the

2320
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:16,992
He's determined that because no true conservative her Patriot would kill civilians

2321
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:20,320
Then there's someone who does isn't to conserve

2322
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,368
That's already a complete disaster

2323
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,160
Herbalogic respected but then

2324
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:30,304
He insists that because this person is not a conservative they must be an anti-fascist pretending to be a conservative

2325
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,840
Did demonize The Patriot

2326
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:37,216
It's really hard for me to put this any other way than to say that this is not adult mental process

2327
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,752
This is bad

2328
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,800
This is really really bad thinking

2329
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
Do you know what the other part of that

2330
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Okay

2331
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,176
So prove

2332
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:49,760
It's proven to you that it was a conservative you have to

2333
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
To agree with it

2334
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,064
What do you know who killed a globe

2335
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Wow

2336
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Now here's the issue

2337
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,648
So

2338
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:00,512
Did the simple reality is that there are absolutely conservatives and right-wing or to plan

2339
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,048
And Carry Out attacks on civilians

2340
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,840
These are real events with real victim

2341
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
Thomson real loved ones

2342
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
Who's paying Alex

2343
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
Don't give a fuk up

2344
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,704
About because it threatens the purity of his own self

2345
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:12,800
The in his desperation to glorify his political side

2346
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
He behaves in Calais ways

2347
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,152
Sableye the fact that his side is nowhere near as pure as he likes

2348
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:17,920
Super 10

2349
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,688
But

2350
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:22,016
Since you saying that any real conservative would Target globalist

2351
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:25,600
Then I guess he's taking ownership of Cesar sayoc

2352
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:28,928
B Baka bomber who sent bombs to the clintons and George Soros

2353
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,464
Among other globulus Target

2354
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,256
If he sang that accent

2355
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:36,864
Can civilians or just antifascista Volkswagen the Patriots and any real conservative Patriot

2356
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,400
Would Target the globalist

2357
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,192
The truly that one was real

2358
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,472
Whoops

2359
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:44,800
Nope turns out Alex said that was a false flag to

2360
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,616
Alex is worldview and narratives are childish

2361
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:50,432
Instructions is propped up in order to make sure that he never has

2362
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:53,760
Have to feel the impact of the rhetoric that he puts into the world

2363
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,576
I used too much of a coward to even State internally consistent

2364
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,136
Play by the rules that he's made up for himself

2365
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:02,720
If it's somebody who doesn't fit his definition of what a patriot would do with the

2366
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:06,048
Anti-fascist Volkswagen Patriots

2367
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,632
Stand hey it's the Globus false flagging themselves in order to get pity

2368
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,912
F*** you man

2369
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,192
Your Heroes are Terror

2370
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,240
Yeah just admit

2371
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:21,408
So in order to reinforce his idea that these shootings are just anti-fascists who are coming out there and

2372
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,432
False flag

2373
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,480
Sure he brings up the Dayton shooting

2374
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,272
And I find

2375
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,112
His take on it's really boring and we parted like

2376
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
They tried to cover up online

2377
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:33,952
Stewart

2378
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,280
Castellan

2379
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,864
Texas attack that he was antifa leftist and that was confirmed

2380
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,144
Pull up on his side

2381
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:45,728
Who put that up

2382
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,752
Who protected him

2383
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
The question

2384
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,152
That's I'm sorry I said dating I'm at the El Paso shooting

2385
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:53,920
But

2386
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
Diaz that response

2387
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
I find

2388
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
To be really

2389
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,320
He doesn't want to be involved in this

2390
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,648
He's just there to talk about gun paranoia

2391
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Saying that it's okay for them to

2392
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:11,072
Boot wantonly murder their political enemies

2393
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,632
I think he has a line though and as we saw in 2013

2394
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:17,984
When Alex is trying to save those people in the pictures that you found on 4chan at the Boston Marathon

2395
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,776
We're secretly seagulls

2396
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,848
Stewart said I don't I can't say that based on

2397
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,384
Just whatever they're wearing

2398
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
I'm not going

2399
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,688
I'm not going to go along with this

2400
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:29,760
I feel very similar thing here he has a line of like

2401
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,808
Whatever you're doing

2402
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,112
Alex wants him to get involved

2403
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,720
So that's about the end of anything with real Subs

2404
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,000
On this episode

2405
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,536
But I have a couple last

2406
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:44,608
Clips and one of them is Alex get the caller

2407
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
Who asked

2408
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,656
About something very specific

2409
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,984
And I think that this clip is only important

2410
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,264
As a demonstration of

2411
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,032
How full of s***

2412
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:59,712
Have you ever heard of Carl Miller it was a Vietnam vet teaches about Constitution

2413
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,040
He has some videos in anyway one of them

2414
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:06,112
Mauriotto

2415
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,696
Anybody charge

2416
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,768
Any right that you have the Second Amendment any of them

2417
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:19,680
Anybody can file a writ of Cold War against that judge and anybody connected with them

2418
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,496
Trying to do that if you heard of this thing

2419
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,824
So look

2420
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,360
This is Sovereign citizen

2421
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:35,552
But what's interesting is this guy asks have you heard of this Carl Miller guy you're going to talk about the concert again

2422
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
I have no idea what you're talking about

2423
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
That's Alex's music reaction

2424
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:45,024
Denny's anytime anybody asking do you know about this isn't you but I do

2425
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,072
I'm an expert on everything

2426
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,656
That's a really good demonstration of his lying Direct

2427
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:54,496
And then realizing

2428
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,312
My name is last one Alex

2429
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,640
He ends up playing a special report about how everybody is

2430
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
The Otherworld

2431
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:06,016
Olga's enemies are all demons

2432
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:12,416
And I just love the way it starts it so just to end this on a softer lighter note then maybe Stewart Roads just

2433
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
Satisfying

2434
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,976
Political violence or

2435
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:18,048
I want about the scholars calling for political assassination

2436
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
Or

2437
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,840
Alex

2438
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:24,192
Deciding Steve Janik is totally cool

2439
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,472
Yours just something

2440
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
Straight up.

2441
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
There is a shame

2442
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,080
No one knows who first coined

2443
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,920
It goes like this

2444
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:40,320
But convincing the world

2445
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:46,464
Okay okay alright

2446
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:53,120
18 f****** with me

2447
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
Has to be f****** with

2448
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,008
I'm going to guarantee that Alex didn't look into this in anyway and he's just being a blowhard

2449
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,336
I also guarantee that he's just quoting The Usual Suspects

2450
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,896
And has no idea what that movie is reference

2451
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,528
Generally people tribute this precise formulation of the expression to Charles baudelaire

2452
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,088
The line traces back to a short story published

2453
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:16,928
Before but the vague idea expressed in the quote goes back

2454
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
A little farther than that

2455
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:23,584
An 1836 a Quaker preacher named John Wilkinson Road quote what are the artifices of Satan

2456
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,144
Is to induce man to believe he doesn't

2457
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,984
Alex is definitely referencing The Usual Suspects

2458
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,520
Which was referencing baudelaire

2459
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,056
But from there

2460
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,592
Line is kind of broken

2461
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:38,944
Baudelaire was probably not referencing relatively obscure Quaker authors

2462
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:42,784
It was probably just writing it with a creative poetic flourish

2463
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
Of his own

2464
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,600
Whatever the case is here that expression

2465
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:48,928
Does not go back thousands of years that's completely

2466
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
Unreal

2467
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:57,888
There's a saying no one knows who coined it goes back on

2468
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,656
Baby f****** with me

2469
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,192
Yeah that is blood

2470
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:00,960
That's the

2471
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:01,728
Best

2472
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,008
And only joke

2473
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
He is ever so

2474
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,104
I think there has to be a joke

2475
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,176
There's a thin line between f****** with you and being a blowout

2476
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,968
Yeah that line is something

2477
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,016
I'm not sure where ever be able to really

2478
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:14,784
Not with him

2479
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,808
Clearly Define

2480
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,600
God is that is that is

2481
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,392
The most perfectly exit

2482
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,160
Get a joke

2483
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,440
Whoever wrote that

2484
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:25,024
He maybe he didn't write it maybe somebody is f****** with him I could be

2485
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,072
Oh man cuz that's so good

2486
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,656
So are we going to the end of this then you know I think

2487
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,960
I had to do this episode because there was

2488
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:33,728
Steve pieczenik

2489
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,544
Amazon

2490
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,848
Scary s*** some really dumb

2491
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,152
Stuff and hopefully

2492
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:43,712
If I can do anything to bring to light

2493
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:46,528
The fact that Alex is repurposing stuff they got Rodger

2494
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,552
Just don't sued

2495
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:51,392
I'm very happy to do that because I hope it's okay

2496
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:54,976
Dorothy's to demonstrate that a lot of this whole new narrative about

2497
01:50:55,232 --> 01:51:01,376
Fiona Hill and this whistleblower a defamation against George Soros

2498
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,912
That also goes in there

2499
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:08,800
But this whole new narrative it relies on the same information that did get Rodger

2500
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,592
I think that's a really interesting

2501
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,640
Of this puzzle that

2502
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,456
I don't know if anybody but us realized

2503
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,480
So

2504
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,296
Fun to be able to talk about that I know Alex

2505
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,112
I missed a doona Wacky Wednesday

2506
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
No I had some ideas

2507
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,696
Maybe we'll get a next week

2508
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,000
We we got we got

2509
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Johnny Depp

2510
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,216
Just talked about the Mandalorian for

2511
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:42,080
Alex's graduated to Wacky Wednesday

2512
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:45,920
You might as well talk about the Mandalorian but strangely

2513
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,688
About

2514
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,296
Steve Miller's email hey now hey now

01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,368
So we'll be back on Friday with a new episode

We do have a website

It's knowledge fight.

2518
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
Yes

2519
