00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,256
Everybody come down

7
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
And talk a little bit about Alex Jones

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Is the new crew Spider-Man across the room and opened things up in the air.

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
What's up

10
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
I think this one's going to be what are your top three Fast and Furious films

11
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,696
And I will include Hobbs and shots should you so desire

12
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
I don't know it's really hard to rank the later ones but I'll tell you for sure that one isn't

13
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
In the top three

14
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,752
Yeah I have a soft spot in my heart

15
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,616
2 Fast 2 Furious because the name is hilarious and

16
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
My friend named their cat to cookie

17
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
YouTube Puscifer

18
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,344
Can cat after cookie butter went away

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
What is strong

20
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Just the right age

21
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
Ludacris is in it is amazing that when he came around at

22
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,400
The hell out of that one I would say it's

23
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
It shouldn't be

24
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
The top four but I'm going to put 4

25
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
Okay in my top three

26
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
A four-for-four

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
For furious I don't know

28
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,504
For furious discounted the only reason that one gets in

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
Into the top is because I went to go see that with my buddies

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Missouri

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Dickhole friends we almost

32
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Got kicked out of the theater cuz we were laughing so much

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
You funny

34
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,728
YouTube funny movie I me and my buddy Burger laughing real hard

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
Aggressively by people around us very high

36
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Probably drunk

37
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
And took me at that experience was really fun like this

38
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
The movie is almost

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
The tertiary experience

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
And then I don't know

42
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
All of them all of them

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Always found fast5 to be a very funny

44
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
Yeah I have no idea what might have been Fast and Furious

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
I think that would work

46
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Quite remember

47
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Tokyo Drift was great to you love him

48
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
Guy one of the actors in it is from Missouri

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
I was really proud of that

50
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Missouri

51
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
There's a lot of talk about that when the movie came out

52
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
And they drifted they did

53
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
They didn't dka

54
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
They also do you like so

55
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
You like to drive fast

56
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Basketball

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Anyone else I knew

58
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
I think

59
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Yes I recall we saw that together

60
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
And they keep calling him

61
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Dekay

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
And

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Burger cuz I got

64
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Make a dog talk

65
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
What I wear to the movies over call the doctor X

66
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Anyway fond memories of seeing Fast and Furious movie

67
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
I know a bit about it but I refuse to strongly rank

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones and I'll ranked him as poor

69
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,911
Bottom three

70
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
Yeah dude to go over week

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,591
You cannot get out of present-day because everything keeps happening

72
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
Yeah so we must pay attention and see what's up

73
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Episode today we're going to be going over January 5th

74
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Through 17

75
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Pictures Wednesday through Friday of last

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
And you know there's been

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Currently

78
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Right now

79
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Ever recorded

80
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
This is Sunday

81
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,023
And into next week Alex Jones is out of Studio

82
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
He is making a trip to the East Coast

83
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
He is going to Virginia rally on Monday Richmond he is going to be in DC I don't know yelling at a

84
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,591
The building Trump is having his impeachment hearing

85
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
So he's he's on that

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Trip.

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Preamble to it

88
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Is this three-day stretch

89
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
At the end of last week

90
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
And I think there's

91
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Trouble

92
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
Pretty f****** hilarious things that happen

93
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
But also very responsible very horrible lies that Alex is putting out to the

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Pretty bad consequences

95
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Star All Things

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Considered but also

97
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,935
Just be his normal standard fare where you lies and people just

98
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Incorporate

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727

Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

114
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,951
Donated on an elevated level

I'm so first of all catcher thank you so much you are now it's

116
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Democrat

Mr Kevin thank you so much you are now it's like

118
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
Democrat

119
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
Money off that heroin

120
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
So good

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
Freakishly large

122
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
Catcher And mr. Kevin

123
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
We got a Sketcher if he's in

124
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Stealing signs

125
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
Oh yeah it should be illegal

126
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,423
I don't have a position on baseball rules

127
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,239
I think it's silly that the infield fly rule

128
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
About it I do not know

129
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
If I'm making a sound argument I do not know anything about bass

130
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
The whole thing

131
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,207
I'd like to randomly be in a game where I'm in a position to hit a walk-off home run

132
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Like I like Robert Redford in the neck

133
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Sure

134
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
Whatever however I get there is it in God's plan

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
So I'm there I hit this walk off homerun

136
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Immediately drop down

137
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
Crab walk the bases

138
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
Call man you don't know about the unwritten rules of baseball you'd be murdered I've been told that

139
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
Imagine a 97 mile an hour fastball at

140
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
D-des tells me that

141
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Baseball has a cultural problem that needs to be

142
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Who needs to be a Reformation

143
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
Anyway thank you so much Catcher And mr. Kevin

144
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Enjoy the show

145
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Website.com

146
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Sports show

147
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Baby lovey

148
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm going to actually let's start with an out-of-context

149
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,039
Stone awake

150
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
Was awake

151
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
Rock place for that at

152
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Anyway I want to save it

153
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Dismiss something

154
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Things that I think that everyone's probably in

155
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
Interesting take on

156
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Which is that there's been some videos that have come out of Alex like at the women's March in DC he's like rolling around town in

157
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
When is dump tank

158
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
These are all just videos that Infowars

159
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Put out and I'm

160
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
Not really seeing a ton of folks taking the bait

161
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
Amplifying it and I think that's positive

162
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,415
I'm not particularly interested in this frivolous and desperate attempt to get

163
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Get free press

164
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Give me side like seeing a child acting out

165
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
To get attention

166
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
If you're that kids parent you need to take that behavior serious

167
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Otherwise

168
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
Just leave it alone and ignore it in Jordan

169
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
I'm not Alex's dad

170
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,591
So I'm not concerned with this Behavior look at me I got two

171
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Call he's human resource

172
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
There are more pressing issues today

173
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Namely

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,831
I took the look at Alex's Behavior prior for him leaving on this

175
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
East Coast trip

176
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,207
A lot of Alex's focus seems to be on the upcoming second amendment rally in

177
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
In Virginia

178
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,119
And his desire to preemptively declare that anything that might happen there that's bad that's going to be.

179
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
But there's a little more depth

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
In his bulshit then immediately meets the eye

181
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
And I think it's a wiser worthwhile

182
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
For our purposes

183
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Take a look at it

184
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
But in order to start things off I feel like it'd be best to take a little moment

185
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
To discuss the lead-up to this Richmond rally

186
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
And how things got to the point where we are right now

187
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
As we've discussed a little bit in the past

188
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Are there bensema messiness

189
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Going on in Virginia

190
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
It's better than over-simplification to put it this way but

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Pretty simple explanation

192
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,959
For what got us where we are right now is that the 2019 Virginia election

193
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Untap it

194
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
And that election cycle all 140 of the seats in the Virginia Senate and House of Representatives were up for re-election

195
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
Democrats had a net gain of to see

196
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Seats in the Senate

197
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Which gave him a 20 1219 majority

198
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
In the house the Democrats 1855 245 majority

199
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,951
That's giving them control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time in 20

200
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
6 years

201
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
This naturally led to the right-wing becoming completely paranoid about what would come

202
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:50,239
In an article in the Virginia Mercury members from the new Democratic majority made it pretty clear that the largest focus of their agenda was

203
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
It's going to be reshaping voter access

204
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Set laws

205
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
Taking on redistricting

206
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Repealing voter ID laws

207
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
I'm passing notes

208
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
Excuse needed early voting for every

209
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,599
Currently in system it is now like you can early vote but you have to give total

210
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
It seems weird

211
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
However

212
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
There's another reality

213
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
According to polling

214
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Conducted by everytown

215
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
4 gun safe

216
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Quote

217
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,399
28% of Voters said that a candidate's position on gun issues was the most important

218
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Issue to their vote

219
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
And they found it voters who listed gun issues as their number one issue

220
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Democrats

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
221

222
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,943
That's coming from a gun safety group however so you might not find their polling to compelling

223
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,599
Certainly can find other resources that argue that what drove Democratic voters at the polls was healthcare-related policies and climb

224
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
A change concerns

225
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,231
I think in the end the picture becomes pretty clear that whatever you choose to focus on

226
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
The Democratic party just had a better policy

227
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Please set that appeal to more people right now in Virginia

228
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
The reason gun issues were fronts

229
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Center is because

230
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,799
In May 2019 the former city employee in Virginia Beach went on a shooting

231
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Free killing 12 people and injuring four

232
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
That was just a few months before the election

233
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
But I'll see if you think about it

234
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Virginia state with a long history

235
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
A really high-profile Gunn.

236
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
You had the shooting at the

237
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Congressional baseball game

238
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
2017 the scalise situation

239
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
Get the Beltway snipers he had the case of Allison Parker

240
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
Who's the news anchor who was shot in the middle of interview

241
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
You had the Virginia Tech shooting in 2000

242
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
7

243
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Every state has their own history of gun violence

244
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Virginia's experience some of these really big high-profile cases

245
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,663
So it could make some sense that voters might want to State Legislature that

246
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Lakeside issue head-on

247
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Absolutely

248
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
According to w

249
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
Beauty VR3 gun-related bills and passed the Virginia Senate

250
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
So you know they just need to be signed putting

251
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
For sure

252
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,559
The first Senate Bill 35 quote authorizes any locality to prohibit The Possession

253
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,143
The firearm and ammunition in public spaces during permit

254
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Or events that would otherwise

255
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Require a perm

256
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,311
Do you mean they overreach their Authority and they are trying to take our guns away

257
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Some might say

258
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:09,503
This is basically just saying that he having is that like an outdoor concert or a Saint Patrick's Day Parade you can say no guns

259
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Republic space

260
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
You're going to grab them

261
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
From people and then go to their homes

262
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
You can grab them there

263
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
It's The Logical extension

264
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,047
The second sb69 makes it a misdemeanor for anyone

265
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Child

266
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
This bill makes it a misdemeanor for anyone who is not a license

267
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Firearm dealer

268
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
Buy more than one handgun within a thirty-day.

269
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Even this bill has a

270
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Exemptions

271
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Like if you're buying

272
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Personal Collection of someone's weapon

273
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
Estate sale you can you can do that

274
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
There's also a provision for

275
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Specific license

276
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
You can apply for it to not be

277
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
The subject of this one-gun-a-month limit

278
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
If you have legit

279
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,559
Reason to need to purchase more than that say for a business

280
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Independence

281
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Security company

282
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Course there's even exempt

283
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
Engines for like if your gun goes missing and you report it

284
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
You can replace that gun

285
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Within that

286
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,015
Oh and also this totally doesn't apply to literally anyone who has a valid Virginia concealed handgun permit

287
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
It also doesn't apply to privates

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
This is not a very severe bill as there's a whole lot of groups

289
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
People who are exempt from

290
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
And even people who are not

291
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
Are only going to get charged with a misdemeanor if they run afoul of it

292
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,631
People who are in bigger trouble for not following the

293
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
30-day rule are licensed

294
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Gun dealers

295
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
Who has heavier punishment

296
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Under this new belt which may

297
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Makes sense I guess

298
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
This last bill is sp70

299
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Which requires background checks for all gun transfer

300
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Except again

301
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
They're a bunch of exempt

302
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Princeton

303
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
Gun transfers between family members are exempt

304
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
Hazard gun transfers at gun shows and gun ranges

305
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,023
The reason for exemptions for gun ranges in gun shows is because this is not about gun sales

306
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
This is what literally

307
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Handing someone a gun

308
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Big Bill is about transferring of

309
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Possession of a gun

310
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Gone to another person

311
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
It'll be kind of impossible to require that everyone at a shooting range

312
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
Do they have to go through background checks

313
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Being able to shoot it

314
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Target

315
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
Best build builds Indies exemptions

316
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Which makes sense

317
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Also makes the bills kind of weed

318
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
If the gun weirdo world is good at one thing it's

319
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Getting around laws on tagging

320
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
How many calories

321
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
It seems like this is a friends they could

322
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,023
Exploit really either they would have any issue

323
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Other than like

324
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
The Sovereign citizen to Wooden

325
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Follow it anyway

326
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Right

327
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,519
Cuz I don't follow the crowd in capital letters today

328
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
So anyway those are the three bills that have been passed

329
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
Appointed recording of Popeye the Virginia

330
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
And their way to being put into Act

331
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
There are other bills that the legislature has introduced including military-style rifle bands and red flag laws but it's

332
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,439
Seems like fairly middle-of-the-road

333
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Stuff that is

334
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
What does what is actually gotten

335
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
Whatever the reality of the situation is begun weirdo Community is taking this as an all-out assault on the very basic

336
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Right to have a gun

337
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
Part of this is because these dudes don't really have a reason to exist like the people who make a bunch of money off this stuff you know

338
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Unless guns are always

339
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Best interest

340
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
To create whatever controversy

341
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Is the camp surrounded esorts

342
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
I wouldn't be too surprised if some of the more intelligent among the right-wing

343
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Extremist communities

344
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
Also pretty scared about the Voting Rights issues at the Virginia legislature plans to take a condo

345
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
We make a great public

346
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Blick case against expanding vote out loud

347
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Tougher to get people on your side when you

348
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,919
Try to make an argument like that you know you can whip people into a frenzy easy

349
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
The timing here is what becomes particularly

350
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
A troubling though

351
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
Because just as these bills were making their way through the Ledger

352
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Just later and if that was on the horizon that would be

353
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Completely co-opted by the most

354
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Xtreme fringes

355
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Which brings us to Lobby.

356
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
So the group returned this year's Lobby day into a complete disaster

357
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Is a group that Sedona as the Virginia citizens Defense League

358
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
A GroupMe is presumably

359
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
They're very similar to a lot of gun folks

360
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
We ended up and have

361
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Encountered on the this show

362
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,503
Directions are less lobbying and More obstructionism in

363
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
Borderline Vira

364
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,695
Honestly the probably most notable prior to this year for two

365
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
Large-scale media-related gas

366
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
The first was when they tried to sue Katie

367
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,655
We correct for how she edited a documentary that you made called Under the Gunn

368
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
They felt that you defamed

369
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
And sued for 12 million dollars which is

370
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Of course thrown out of court

371
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
Their other gas was when their president Philip Van Cleef got tricked by Sacha Baron Cohen and his show who is Amir

372
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
In the segment he was in Cohen's Mossad character got Vancleave

373
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
To promote kindergarten

374
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
An initiative to Arms

375
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
School children as young as

376
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
3 years old

377
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
It's legitimately embarrassing

378
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
Cleavage out there singing songs promoting guns

379
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Plush animals on them to make them

380
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Fun for kids

381
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,983
One of them is a rocket-propelled grenade launcher which is should be a dead giveaway

382
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
A gun that

383
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Longer than a baby

384
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
In the hands of a baby

385
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
Please stick around for what he described as an hours-long interview

386
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Was revealed to be a Sacha Baron Cohen

387
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
He claimed he only stuck around to gather Intel on who is behind the video to warn the rest of the Republicans

388
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
Undercover operative

389
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Yeah you knew it was

390
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
The setup you Caesar

391
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
According to the Virginia Mercury it doesn't

392
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Seemed like. Weirdos bought that excuse

393
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
Comment on the vcdl Facebook

394
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm a vcdl number but Philip if you're so damn dumb to fall into this trap I think you need to find a new gig

395
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,039
Just how could you do more harm to the 2nd Amendment in Virginia gun rights

396
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Another combat

397
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
How are we

398
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,695
Going to just be mad at the leftist media when our own guy walked into this

399
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
This is hilariously terrible

400
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Step down

401
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
It's a surprise ideas still in charge of the B CDL

402
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
That's that

403
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Crazy shouldn't be surprised

404
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,543
Is Oliver North going to take over for me

405
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Consultant

406
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Shouldn't be surprised that he still around

407
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
Littering that he also didn't

408
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Step down after he made some if

409
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Common sense

410
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Did the Sandy Hook shooting

411
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:40,415
He's asked by The Washington Post why people like guns like the one used in that tragedy and he said they were quote son

412
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
This guy's a dick which is what I'm getting at

413
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,071
Yeah Vancleave in the vcdl lower part of the forces

414
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,423
Behind all these counties in Virginia passing these gun sanctuary resolute

415
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
With your kin are legally meaningless

416
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,615
If there's one person who's at the center of the escalation of things in Virginia I would say it's fair to say

417
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Mostly Philip

418
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Van Cleef

419
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Because of his actions things have now

420
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Inspirobot

421
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
We'd be out of can

422
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
Control whether rhetoric is amplifying

423
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Things are asked

424
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Escalating

425
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Extreme group

426
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Are being

427
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Towards

428
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
Like a moth to the flame being drawn towards this

429
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
What could have been just a normal day we like guns

430
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Kind of demonstration

431
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,703
Well if you are in Virginia

432
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Where are you

433
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Long enjoyed rampant

434
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Overwhelming

435
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Control to then

436
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Lose an election

437
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Thinking

438
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Well we'll see lost because

439
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Democracy

440
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Allowed

441
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Then of course you're going to try and base

442
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Sickly intimidate your

443
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Political

444
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
Listen to inactivity you met that's there

445
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
That's our main goal

446
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
So in addition to the legislature being Democrats also Governor Ralph Northam is a Democrat as well

447
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
I enjoy that makes him evil

448
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
According to

449
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Folks like that

450
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,079
Seems like a real

451
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
Real Not Grey dude

452
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
He signed an executive order Banning

453
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,783
Guns and other weapons from the sight of this this rally

454
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Anto

455
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Because

456
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
Look at it

457
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Really was becoming more or less

458
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
Completely unpredictable gun rally

459
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
So he put this ban in place effective

460
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Friday the 17th through Tuesday the 20

461
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
This executive order was also Declaration of a state of emergency

462
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Based on credible intelligence

463
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
What's the 10,000

464
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
People from out-of-state

465
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
We're planning to convert

466
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
And I quote

467
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,920
Available information suggests that a substantial amount

468
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
Substantial number

469
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Of these.

470
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Ozarks

471
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Spectre to come from outside the Commonwealth

472
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
May be armed

473
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
And have is their purpose not peaceful assembly but violin

474
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Rioting in insurrection

475
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Yeah

476
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,256
It's hard to say exactly what his credible intelligence is or was

477
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
Since we aren't privy to the inner workings of Virginia law enforcement

478
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
But if you have to go off with publicly available

479
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
I think you should come to the conclusion the Northam

480
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Decision was

481
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
More than just

482
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
For one thing you have Stewart Roads and The Oath Keepers make

483
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
The trip up to the rally

484
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,736
Plenty of all keepers have been arrested for things like having Napalm bombs or planning to take over small towns in the past

485
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
So their involvement in something like this

486
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Is definitely a red flag

487
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
For months now

488
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
Talk about an impending Civil War

489
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
And even

490
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,256
Publicly on Alex Jones is Joe he's literally said that it's important

491
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
Start while Trump is in office

492
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
This is a man who's been very clear about his intent

493
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
I do think that

494
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,008
They're there a position to Red Flag laws is also personal

495
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Most of these people

496
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Building red flags

497
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
It may be they are covered in red

498
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
That could be

499
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
True

500
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
Leinster road is dangerous and scary

501
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
And him joining this Virginia business

502
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
He has is definitely not good

503
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
However

504
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
He's far from the top of the list in terms of these scary raspy

505
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Vector what's going on

506
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
There are a ton of

507
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Indicated

508
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,656
Interest in attending or intention to attend

509
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
But

510
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
In terms of

511
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,776
People who have no

512
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Concrete information about

513
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
I would say the thing that is a most alarming

514
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Is a group called The Base

515
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
In the last week 23 person

516
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Some cells allegedly members of this group called the face

517
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
Square arrested amid plans to carry out violin

518
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,952
Three Men and George were planning to murder a married couple they believe their high-level aunt

519
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Antifa

520
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
That would have been upsetting on its own

521
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
But what made it much more notable is that this was

522
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
The 2nd

523
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
Three-person group arrested within like a day

524
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
In Maryland another Trio is rest

525
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
This one including a former

526
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Canadian Army member who have been exposed as having Association

527
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
With white supremacist groups and then disappearing

528
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
The FBI Advent

529
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
Had this cell under surveillance

530
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:56,160
I need to learn that one of them had made an assault rifle he described as a machine gun capable of firing more than one round

531
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
The time

532
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
These men have discussed attending a rally in Virginia

533
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
To a headline in slate

534
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Quote

535
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
Neo-nazis allegedly discussed open

536
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Opening fire at Virginia's pro-gun rally slated for Monday

537
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
Governor Northam had credible intelligence of threats

538
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
Violence at the rally

539
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
In this very well could have been what he was referring

540
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Of course it could very well be that this

541
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Just one of multiple

542
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
Instances of violent threats around of the event

543
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,808
Whatever the case when it comes to group like the bass

544
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,904
I think it's probably best not to just dismiss it as straight talk or like

545
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Hey you guys talk

546
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Okay so

547
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,864
From what I'm hearing I'm far less worried about Stewart Road seeing as how he has a public

548
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
And

549
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
I'm more than a little bit of a monetary interest in

550
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Continuing with

551
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
The paranoia but not

552
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
All out

553
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
War where is this looks like

554
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,896
Three person terrorist cells that are loosely

555
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Affiliated

556
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
It appears that way

557
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
Cool cool cool cool.

558
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
It is one of those things where it is true that

559
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
Kind of is the end of the road for the revenue stream

560
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
For someone like Stewart Road

561
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
Unless I guess you do know there is a civil war and he

562
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Recreates like a fiefdom

563
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:14,240
For himself outside of his capabilities

564
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Mistreater

565
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
I wouldn't say

566
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
That's fair

567
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
I would say it's best not to dismiss these people in these

568
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
These arrests that got made

569
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
And that's because the base

570
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,368
Is a group that explicitly and specifically about creating

571
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
The terrorist

572
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
They are not interested in the people posting stuff online or slick media dicks

573
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Like Richard Spencer

574
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
They exist to help

575
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,400
Encourage and train white supremacists and neo-nazis to carry out in

576
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Real-life attack

577
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
The return of white tiida

578
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,056
Started in 2018 by a man who goes by the Alias Norman's

579
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
Sphere the base operator

580
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
Encrypted online forums and message

581
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
Aspiring soldiers for whiteness

582
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Connect with each other

583
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
And they get to learn about a wide array of topic

584
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Cyclone wolf

585
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Send chemical weapons

586
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
There's steadfastly acceleration

587
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Extended signs that they want to commit Acts

588
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Twitchell provoked a backlash

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
Which they believe will lead to the ultimate goal

590
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,168
To the gigantic War that'll give him the opportunity to overthrow the government which they feel is run by the

591
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,752
Do they not know what Charles Manson

592
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Plan was

593
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Come down

594
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
One thing that makes

595
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
It's the base different from your run-of-the-mill b g

596
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,552
They have an emphasis on United white identity and be or Nazi groups who otherwise have

597
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
Tactical or ideological differences

598
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Their push

599
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Is that there

600
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Common interest is greater

601
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Then what they disagree about

602
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
So they need to work together

603
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,352
This is heavily reminiscent of the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous meeting held an esta

604
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Is Park Colorado in nice

605
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
1892

606
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
We're militia dude klansman neo-nazis and Alex's body Larry Pratt got together to formulate a strategy after Ruby

607
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Ruby Ridge

608
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Belligerent

609
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,664
Right-wing extremist activity

610
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
It's hard to imagine that a big Summit among the major

611
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Players didn't have some role in that right

612
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,696
Coincidentally Larry Pratt's going to Richmond

613
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Is probably just

614
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Yeah yeah

615
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Not important

616
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
I ate a daffodil

617
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
Like this is so fake this is so

618
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Like cost

619
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Play e

620
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
But at the same time they're they're almost like

621
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
Civil War

622
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Preenact

623
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Like they're there

624
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,664
Play-acting the Civil War that they might accidentally start

625
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
It's really really

626
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
Really tough

627
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
2

628
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
Know how to talk about it responsible

629
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
Because there is

630
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
A feeling of

631
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Not wanting

632
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
To buy into the hype

633
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
These are right-wing Fox of ours are engaging in

634
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
And at the same time not wanting

635
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
2

636
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Not take things that seem like

637
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,216
Pretty serious f*****-up Bad actors seriously

638
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
What their regular MO is

639
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Large

640
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,128
Outside threat that they have no intention of following up on

641
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
But when you start hearing about 3 person

642
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Some terrorist cells

643
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
We're not talking about media blitz these guys are

644
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,112
Legitimately trying to stay under the radar in order to carry out the

645
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
It's that's what that that's what it seems like they're doing

646
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,256
But it also could seem like they're playacting at

647
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
This very terrorist cell thing that there

648
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
You know it's so wild

649
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Very difficult

650
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
I know

651
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
I'm silly

652
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
But I would say

653
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,568
The most fortunate things about members of violent hate groups

654
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Is it that usually hate

655
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Distrust

656
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Each other as much as they did

657
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Distrust anyone else

658
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,784
Another planning illegal shitzo anyone there associating with could be effect

659
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
This paranoia Tennessee impede their ability to organize

660
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,928
Earnest attempt on the part of right-wing extremist

661
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
To put their differences aside and

662
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
Collaborate are a very bad sign

663
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
It's something that needs to be taken very seriously

664
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
I think Wendy

665
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
I can't pretend to have any kind of elevated understanding of what's going on or what will happen on Monday

666
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
In Virginia

667
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
Outside of information publicly available

668
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
I can say without reservation

669
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
Is that members of an accelerationist Neo-Nazi group would not be planning on bringing any legal self-described machine-gun to Monday

670
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
These rally to peacefully at lawfully open

671
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
Open carry to support gun

672
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
I doubt that is absurd

673
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
I don't believe that for a

674
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Today it's

675
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
It's all about Recreation

676
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
You know it's at that's that that he made it

677
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
And that's what

678
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
This is what really highlights

679
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
The problem

680
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
People who are concerned about possible trouble at the rally

681
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
Are concerned about normal law-abiding

682
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Citizens carrying

683
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,272
I would assume most of them would have no qualms of trump supporters open carrying as amendment rally

684
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
They were problems

685
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Do people like these neo-nazis

686
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
You are being

687
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Attracted to this

688
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,512
People like Alex hear the concern that there are violent wide identity groups planning to attend

689
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
And he spends it by saying that the

690
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
Concern is really just

691
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
They think all responsible gun only people in America are terrorists

692
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,752
What he's doing is absorbing people like these members of the base

693
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Into his Collective identity

694
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
And then getting defensive about

695
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
It would be the easiest thing in the world for him to recognize that

696
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,248
These dangerous Fringe elements exist in you have an inch

697
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Kristen separating yourself

698
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
But Alex doesn't want that

699
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,672
For whatever reason to possibly guess what that is

700
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
I went to the consistent trend of inclusion

701
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
When it comes to White identity extremist

702
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
Just either he's a real he wants to hear from both sides

703
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Yeah I think that's it

704
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
He's balanced

705
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
What are the tragedies listening to Alex's show and understanding how he operates is that I know that even if 100 neo-nazis were

706
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,944
Arrested with explicit plans to attack minorities and liberals at this rally

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
And they all confessed

708
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
Alex would still say that he has proof that they're also

709
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
He arose contracts tan

710
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Easy

711
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
He's built a world of information that's so insulated from reality that he could make the claim Danielle Don sense about eulogium

712
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
City for a while then pretend he's proven his point

713
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
Probably let him get away with it

714
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,448
All right-wing extremists are secretly globalist

715
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
All left-wing counter demonstrators are also secretly minions of the globalist

716
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
No one really exist

717
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Picked up Alex

718
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
And everyone else is on

719
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Some kind of control agent working for

720
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Dialectic

721
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
Benton Alex's gunby

722
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,320
It's a completely nonsensical worldview and it's completely

723
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
I'm totally into

724
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
At least it is until you consider it

725
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,208
Through the prism of supporting right-wing extreme

726
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Start to look at it in that light

727
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Big things make a lot more sense

728
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
We're going to get into this episode at along the way Alex is going to go out of his way to preemptively declare that any violence that happens at Monday

729
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
Is Rally if any happens it's going to be a false

730
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,128
The globals to trying to start a civil war they want to kick it off

731
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,736
I've seen some Publications glibly pointing out that Alex is pushing that angle

732
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
But I really wish they would flash out

733
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
He's doing that

734
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,392
Alex knows that people like those members of the base have been arrested

735
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,952
Seemingly plotting to commit violent act at the rally

736
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
And I'm certain he doesn't naive enough

737
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
To think that they're the only

738
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,120
He's friends with f****** Stewart Roads and he's been an associate of Larry Pratt

739
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
For years now

740
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
He has to know that there's chatter

741
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,056
From his side of the aisle this is very much in line probably start here

742
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
He knows that

743
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Guest on his show have said that

744
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
And if God forbid anything tragic happen

745
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
He needs an excuse

746
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Implace

747
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Ahead of time

748
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
To make sure that no-one blames his right-wing extremist

749
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Is a very difficult situation to Assassin

750
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
Particulate from the outside

751
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't want to buy into any right-wing hype that

752
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
There's going to be viola

753
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
Start because

754
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
I think they're taking them

755
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Face value plays into their narrative

756
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
At the same time

757
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
I don't want to miss

758
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
I don't want to diminish

759
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,360
And failed to recognize that there are a lot of very extreme people who have attached themselves to this rally

760
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
And that they are not good

761
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,504
Personally I hope the calmer heads prevail and the day passes without him

762
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
As of right now as a recording

763
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
I've seen some indications of people

764
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,208
Gunn weirdo side they're encouraging people to stay home

765
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,512
As the chaos of the situation is way too

766
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
Unpredictable

767
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
Stay away from

768
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
As a recording I have no idea how things going to shake out but it's entirely clear that there's one side that's basically desperately pleading

769
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
For something awful to happen

770
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
So they can justify living out there Civil War

771
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
Fantasies

772
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Stay-home

773
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
I think that dichotomy speaks volume

774
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
Sorry about that long rant

775
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,504
At b a

776
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
A seltzer

777
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
It was

778
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
There's a lot of context

779
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Yeah the thing I see as most worrying

780
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Or the thing that I'm most worried about

781
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
People who are play

782
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Not those

783
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Not that the Luna

784
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Text butt

785
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
More like

786
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Somebody just

787
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Mentally fires

788
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
And that that

789
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,080
That seems far not a likely Thing by any stretch

790
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
But as far as scenarios go historically it would make

791
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
Far more sense for some idiot to

792
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Accidentally

793
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
The safety off

794
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
And then everybody goes

795
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Active and that's

796
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:06,208
That's the thing you know it's it's a very scary possibility I don't I don't want to go

797
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Through like what is this

798
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,328
No not at all what I'm saying

799
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
It just

800
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
I don't want to pee I just don't engage

801
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
That

802
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
So we start on the 50

803
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,056
Just for clarification because

804
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
Easy to paint Alex

805
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
The news of those Neo-Nazi arrest

806
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Doesn't happen until the sick

807
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
So on the 50

808
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Alex doesn't know about that

809
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Achy couldn't

810
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
So what are you doing

811
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
You breaking some big news

812
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Use

813
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Don't you say it

814
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Like that

815
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,584
This is going to be a llama situation all over again

816
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
There's no law

817
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,960
Infowars

818
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
100% been the tip of the spear

819
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,080
Again I don't say that say oh look

820
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
What are the tip of the spear

821
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Are we great

822
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Jessie

823
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Actually a great responsibility

824
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
In fact it was Paul Watson

825
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
About

826
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
4 years ago

827
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,952
That began to really fuzzy and she'll movement as being a mass shooter

828
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Magnified at Infowars magnified

829
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Blind dog story

830
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,960
And now the FBI and the Texas State Police have come out and said actually

831
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,288
Almost every Mass shooter has been a

832
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Incel

833
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
Involuntarily celibate into the occult

834
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,736
Braided line

835
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
Population

836
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,552
Pictures of Whitman

837
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,720
So once again Alex is pretending he was ahead of the curve on something

838
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
We'll get into this Texas FBI report a little bit later but suffice it to say that literally none of it

839
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Who sang read that report

840
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
This is absolutely constructed out of thin air

841
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Actually

842
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Thought out

843
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Complete finnair

844
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
Alex has not read this report

845
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,456
He's only read an article about it that was posted on National file which again is website run by his employee Tom Papa

846
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
The article is

847
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
National file

848
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,648
It's basically I just about how the report warns about an incel Rebellion

849
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Well completely ignoring everything else in the report

850
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Spoiler alert that's because most of the report is about how the number one domestic terrorism issue in the country is people who believe the same thing

851
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Exist

852
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
To distract

853
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,800
From the actual point of the record and make it a story that Alex can effortless

854
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Mostly cover on his own show

855
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,968
And this among other stories recently really highlights our national files becoming a laundering house

856
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Prefer a proper

857
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
They are Dara send it

858
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
Analysis World which is weird because he used to have Paul Joseph Watson Road right Olive

859
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Yeah

860
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
I think Paul is

861
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
Not distancing himself but

862
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Definitely

863
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Keeping clear of a certain

864
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
Not sure I'm not sure 100% what it is cuz I want to still using him as a source for like blaming Muslims

865
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,104
Australian fires still linking to like Summit. News articles

866
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Connect

867
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
It's a hedging

868
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,528
Got I got this guy coming in this dump a guy

869
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
You really post a lot of articles

870
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm going to go with it I like

871
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
That's right I don't

872
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Give a s*** about quality

873
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
No

874
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
I think it's more like a

875
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Could also be the those depositions

876
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Paul Joseph Watson was kind of like

877
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
Yeah I don't know I told Alex he f***** up not really Towing the company line

878
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:37,408
Stories that came out about it we're about how Paul threw him under the bus maybe Alex's

879
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Derbyshire

880
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,248
In case he goes Rogue

881
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
I need top happer

882
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Well I mean

883
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,880
Massive stepped out yeah that's not great

884
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
I mean there's there's something to be said for

885
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Keeping certain

886
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
Subjects kind of

887
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,120
Separate from each other you know you got Tom pepper to laundry this stuff and you can call Joseph over here laundry

888
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Ria in ended better

889
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
To have a diversity of controlled sources

890
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
Put all your eggs in one basket as you know we can get more information is that they are things that Paul

891
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
He wouldn't

892
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,392
Go along with Alex if he was going to try and pull another kind of Sandy Hook probably would

893
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
We go along with just about any

894
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
So Alex gets said to talk anymore about this

895
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Report and

896
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Man it's so funny how

897
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Here it is he hasn't read

898
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
Magical crystal ball

899
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
This is well but

900
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,712
ATL still in control

901
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Well now all that's been outside

902
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
Enforcement

903
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
It's antifa leftist incel needle-dick

904
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Send the problem

905
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:06,240
Gotcha do you think this report talks about antifa leftist in cell needle dicks I would say that most

906
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:12,640
Reports I've read from a professional service have not added beat at any point

907
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,688
I wouldn't join

908
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Probably too much

909
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:21,088
Talking about Izzy newly-released Texas domestic

910
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Stick terrorism threat

911
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
It's not a long.

912
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Only about forty nine pages

913
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
Some of them are blank

914
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
So there's really no excuse for Alex not to

915
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Reddit

916
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
If he had

917
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,352
Maybe this wouldn't be such a gigantic embarrassment

918
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
So let's imagine that he has read the document

919
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
I know he has

920
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
Let's just imagine

921
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
I'm putting myself in this headspace

922
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
And here he is on air

923
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Finally law enforcement is coming out of telling the truth

924
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,992
He's pretending that that true that they're telling is that all of these Mass Shooters are antifa leftist in selling needle-dick

925
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
But let me read to you from pain

926
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
3 in the report

927
00:39:53,856 --> 00:40:00,000
Based on the prevalence of recently conducted attacks Nationwide white racially-motivated is currently the most violently

928
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
Act of domestic terrorism

929
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:07,680
Tom pepper remove that page before it got bad weather report

930
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
What other type of domestic terrorism threatening or forceful Behavior the loss of life from recent worm

931
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
White racially-motivated

932
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
Text elevates the nature of this specific bread

933
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Seems like

934
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Give Alex

935
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,856
Thinks that this report is law enforcement finally telling the truth and that truth is that white identity-related terrorism

936
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
The most serious problem in the domestic

937
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
I thought I was at this report was about all the shooters were antifa in cell needle-dick

938
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Terrorism

939
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
White leftist

940
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Needle dick

941
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
It's whatever

942
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
Exist what time

943
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
In this document and it's in the URL of a footnote

944
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,920
In the form of a link to New York Times article about the classes at Berkeley back in 2017

945
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,576
Literally nowhere in this document is there any indication that any of the shooters covered were inspired by auntie

946
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,208
Answer incels the report doesn't know that they are they are equipped emerging domestic terrorism

947
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,304
And that this group to be aware of in the future based on some past attack

948
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
Max and Chloe

949
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Dreamly violent online rhetoric

950
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
Dissection weather report

951
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
Detailed instances of incel related violence includes five attack

952
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
From 2014

953
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Into the present

954
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,384
And literally none of them are stories that I've ever heard Alex cover

955
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,736
Although he probably did Cover Elliot Rodger back in 2014

956
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
I haven't listened to those episodes but I imagine

957
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,880
His take on it was not good I think it would probably have been

958
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Let me get let me check

959
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
Maybe didn't happen

960
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:41,632
Right love that guy guy Wasn't Man Enough

961
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
The fact that this report mentions in cells is really good for

962
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
Alex because he can use that to pretend that it isn't most

963
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Play about people he agrees

964
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,663
Therefore instances listed of terrorism motivated by anti-abortion

965
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Any recent history Alex Azar

966
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Bryson leanings in favor

967
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
Violence against people who work at the abortion field

968
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
Airport list five in

969
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,671
Census of sovereign citizen related domestic terrorism

970
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
Definitely seeing Alex Express

971
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
Sovereign citizen

972
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Slim-Fast

973
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
Probably not enough to suggest he's a full-on

974
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
But enough to make me think

975
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
He doesn't want to talk about their violence

976
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
Laws that I think he would go Sovereign citizen

977
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,567
Yeah I don't think

978
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
Yeah I don't think it goes.

979
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Unlike

980
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
Well obviously deposition

981
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
Do you like do you like Lady Sovereign

982
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
No.

983
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Awful

984
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
It's awful that he doesn't like lady soft

985
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
It's a bummer

986
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,999
But more importantly

987
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
Report highlights white racially-motivated domestic

988
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Terrorism has the largest threat in the field

989
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
Specifically pointing

990
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
How a lot of it is driven by belief in the great replacement

991
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Conspiracy

992
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Which Alex is

993
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Bullion board

994
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
Airport is an overview of different

995
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Sorts of domestic Terror threats

996
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
That exists in the country

997
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
It's not really biased towards one particular viewpoint

998
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:06,623
You can say that they're singling out white people but there's also a section on black racially-motivated terrorism in there too

999
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:12,767
You can say that they're singling out right-wing anti-government people but there's also a section about Anarchist motivated violence

1000
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
As well as environmental and Animal Rights Act

1001
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
It's a broad analysis

1002
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
But if you actually read the report it would be literally impossible to escape

1003
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
The conclusion

1004
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Who spelled out at

1005
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
At the beginning of the report

1006
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,103
Namely that white racially-motivated domestic terrorism

1007
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
The most violently active type in

1008
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
In the country

1009
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Alex cannot allow that to be the

1010
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
Conclusion People Come Away with so instead of engage

1011
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
File article

1012
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
I need direct people to that

1013
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,999
So they can read that and pretend that they've also read the report

1014
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
This is an act of running interference

1015
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Spur White

1016
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
Racially-motivated domestic terrorist

1017
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
If you're endorsing this report

1018
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,983
In claiming that the conclusion is that all these shooters are

1019
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,519
Antifa leftist in Selbyville

1020
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
Your gaslighting your audience

1021
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
And you're trying to cover up the reality that white man

1022
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Nationalism and white supremacy

1023
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
It's a severe problem and it's getting worse

1024
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
That's it this is this is where you get into that like

1025
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
If you look at this through the prism of

1026
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
Hoarding disorder

1027
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:15,231
Do pigs like white racially-motivated extremism

1028
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Everything makes sense

1029
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
I mean I guess the only frustrating thing about that

1030
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,519
I'd say maybe there's only been one year and the in American history where

1031
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,079
White racially motivated terrorism wasn't the most

1032
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,407
Like we had 2001 and then ever like

1033
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,967
From before and after it's always been

1034
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm not positive numbers but I

1035
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Willing to bet that there have been some years that's unlike single-a

1036
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
Wish you motivated stuff might have been large

1037
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
I mean I would say I'm not sure is my point like

1038
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Harvey be hard to find a year when

1039
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
You know I did I take it you think I'm probably might be right

1040
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Not sure hundred percent

1041
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
B

1042
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,735
Closer to 100% than it is to

1043
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Is my guess

1044
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah I can't think of it

1045
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
A little bit of Comedy

1046
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Gloria

1047
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,719
This report was produced by the Texas Fusion Center

1048
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
Absolutely

1049
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Every single thing about it

1050
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,375
2012 article by Kurt Nimmo on Infowars

1051
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
Fusion centers not only violate the

1052
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,775
Rights of Americans but also a colossal waste of taxpayer money

1053
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,359
Anyone who listen to Infowars in the preacher a knows that

1054
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,711
Very consistent aspect of their content was the fusion centers were hubs of evil

1055
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
And they needed to be destroyed

1056
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,343
A lot of that was based on how these centres were able to collaboratively collect

1057
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Intelligent

1058
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,207
Pilot in to recognize Prince and might be missed by police

1059
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Work independently

1060
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
You can make an argument that this pushback

1061
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
They had started around

1062
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
2009

1063
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
The miac report

1064
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:02,239
Was really you know there's nothing quite so dangerous to the right-wing as people learning

1065
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
I think that's probably the biggest

1066
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Fear that sharing information

1067
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah they're not fans that

1068
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
It can be tough

1069
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
You know it's like

1070
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
The church wasn't fans of the Gutenberg

1071
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
Nothing but Alex ever say

1072
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
Nothing that enforced puts out

1073
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
Everything is made up and the principal

1074
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,207
Leica I hate fusion centers

1075
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,023
With all these principles they claim they're behind their action

1076
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
It's all a facade

1077
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
None of this means anything

1078
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
So

1079
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
This report is going to play a gigantic

1080
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
And

1081
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
All of it

1082
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Salt Lake

1083
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
It it's going to be a through line

1084
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,615
He hasn't read

1085
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Totally

1086
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
It was really impressed rated by that I don't like that that's a

1087
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,039
It's brazier

1088
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
Possible

1089
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Somebody about this report and like

1090
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
They're not

1091
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Like fully onboard with you

1092
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:00,863
How do you get out of that

1093
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
That's probably the best route

1094
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,007
So anyway Alex claims that Virginia is going to call

1095
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
In the UN

1096
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
To take people's guns

1097
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
And then we get some

1098
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Big breaking

1099
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Ginger would let the

1100
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
I don't even think the democratically-controlled the housing

1101
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
Never let the UN

1102
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Virginia

1103
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Now it's loaded.

1104
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
But

1105
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Big

1106
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
2020

1107
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Canoes

1108
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,887
Virginia governor guns

1109
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,495
Talking about using the UN and using proofs

1110
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
Who what

1111
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,847
We all that crazy that we don't mean that

1112
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,551
Heather just getting you in the back of hearing that term emergency

1113
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
Begin to expand

1114
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,863
Then we learn from The Bernie Sanders campaign

1115
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,423
Burn down

1116
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
Milwaukee

1117
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
At the DNC

1118
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Rental Works

1119
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
That's a strong plan for Bernie

1120
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
If Sanders doesn't get the nomination in a truck

1121
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
When's the Round Barn it there

1122
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,319
The fires will spread

1123
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,183
Summer of Rage Across the Nation the government

1124
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Will be under communist control

1125
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,583
And I will then arrest males and put them in

1126
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,399
Re-education camps

1127
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Or some will have to be kill

1128
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
The police will have to be killed

1129
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Submit

1130
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
Cool kind of makes me think this wasn't a quote from

1131
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,943
The Sanders person cuz you said summer of Rage that kind of makes me think of you

1132
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
Did he you know you'd Warren Post all her plans on medium did Bernie post that one on medium Tuesday

1133
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,159
A lot of Milwaukee

1134
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
Is B

1135
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
He has an autumn

1136
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,375
Overrated

1137
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
So first part first that stuff at the beginning where Alex's talking about how Governor Northam was planning on using Roblox

1138
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,103
Troops to seize guns also the Arkansas

1139
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
. is all the roads

1140
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
That's all

1141
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
But here's the thing

1142
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Alex

1143
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Didn't make it

1144
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,855
Alex is reading this headline from the story that Mike Adams posted on natural news

1145
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
This article is really just about how he was on a radio show talking about the research he done into how the governor was going to shut all the

1146
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
I listen to that interview and it

1147
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
No point to these dudes prove anything

1148
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:46,495
Literally all of it is a hey well I heard this from a highly credible high-level source

1149
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
Short all that b*******

1150
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Yeah

1151
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
The reason it's all vague nonsense about an ottoman sources

1152
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
Is because Mike Adams have done any research

1153
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
This is very often the case

1154
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,503
He'd fallen for an internet hoax

1155
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,575
That interview was posted on YouTube on December 9th

1156
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,671
And just six days prior the white nationalist radio host Hal Turner

1157
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
Be completely fabricated narrative the governor Northam it quote

1158
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,327
Allegedly ordered a small Cadre of staffers to begin the

1159
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,143
The process for determining how to cut off electricity telephone

1160
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Faxes

1161
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
Cell phones as well as the internet

1162
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,775
In areas where he plans to send Virginia National Guard troops

1163
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
To forcibly seized gone

1164
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,407
From the airbox Amplified the story on social media there's a bit of a

1165
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
The game of telephone

1166
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
Where the pieces got morphine

1167
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Embellished

1168
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
Ultimately leading to Mike Adam

1169
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Presenting his ankle

1170
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,367
Is it raining over the UN replacing the Virginia National Guard

1171
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,695
I'm making up his own details about how to describe the martial law

1172
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Be enacted

1173
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,535
I've seen this sort of thing from Infowars before

1174
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,583
Play launder hoaxes

1175
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
But they pick up on is the

1176
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
Slightly changed some trivial details

1177
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,239
So they can deny that it traces back to the clear hoax source

1178
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
So anyway this is all bulshit

1179
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,383
This is what Mike Adams as game is

1180
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
It's very clear

1181
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Such a ding

1182
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
So much

1183
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Pales in comparison

1184
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
Didn't know that

1185
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
Right we we should have known this all along he's evil

1186
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,815
Commander after all that's a problem

1187
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:19,167
You should have known in the debate

1188
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,007
You got to trust them when they tell you that they said they would

1189
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
Temper down his rhetoric

1190
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,151
No you got to believe when I say

1191
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
This is just Alex reporting on a new video

1192
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Project Veritas

1193
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,855
Kiss band of idiots caught a Bernie staffer saying some f*****-up things on camera

1194
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,719
I watched about as much of the videos I can tolerate but

1195
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
I swear he's just talking into a camera or unbearable

1196
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
I just cannot handle it

1197
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,423
As best as I can tell a Sanders staffer whose position in the campaign is on

1198
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,215
Clearlake what would live over there at

1199
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
I said some stuff about being in favor of gulags

1200
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
Send re-education camps

1201
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,943
I don't particularly care about this because James O'Keefe has shown himself to be the biggest weasel in the game

1202
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Nothing puts out even deserves a second

1203
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551
Consideration

1204
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,367
Present this stuff manipulative lie like he usually does

1205
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
It's very easy

1206
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,487
For me to say the stuff that staffer was saying is horrible and I don't I don't support it

1207
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,839
I don't care we talked about project the last time we talked about project veritas

1208
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
But the main thing is

1209
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
I don't care

1210
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,263
Anybody else reports on it maybe I'll listen but if it's coming from you

1211
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,359
Cluck-U I even think that is Project Veritas put out something on Alec

1212
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,919
A piece on him I wouldn't do it

1213
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
I don't believe a thing that they've says reputation

1214
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Just to tarnish to God

1215
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,599
Yeah I'm not going to entertain it for a sec

1216
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Right right

1217
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
Could have Nancy Pelosi screaming awful things into his face if I was going to murder his family and I still did

1218
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,583
He probably deceptively at sabotage.

1219
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Yeah

1220
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,399
Even on face value it's

1221
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,239
They talked to in the video was that politically involved

1222
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,079
For instance at one point in the video he says that if Sanders doesn't win

1223
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
We're going to make 1978 look like a f****** Girl Scout f***

1224
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Cookout

1225
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
2 problems

1226
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
1

1227
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,575
The Girl Scouts are not particularly known for their cookout

1228
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
There wasn't an election in 1978

1229
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
He's picking up 68

1230
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,351
Sky is a little bit of it was strange that he was the campaign manager for

1231
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
Do you know what you going to do

1232
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
Brinkley this could be from

1233
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
F****** Rodger Stone

1234
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Acting like he's Bernice

1235
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
A supporter for fucksake

1236
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,615
The entire stick that O'Keefe is working with you is called a composition fallacy

1237
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,687
He's found a low-level person in the Sanders campaign

1238
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:44,831
Probably just someone involved in organising and knocking on doors in Iowa and he caught him at a bar saying some f*****-up stuff

1239
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
The implication is

1240
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,975
Just push that what this guy said is actually would everyone in the Sanders campaign believe

1241
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,255
Probably Sanders himself

1242
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:59,167
This is the entire bit and honestly more than anything else all this reveals to me that the big-money donors who fun project Veritas

1243
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,519
Are becoming more worried about Bernie's numbers and they see him as an actual threat

1244
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,591
Now oh yeah I supposed to just focus on

1245
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
Yeah that's that's one of the things that everybody

1246
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
Who is supposed to really really hate

1247
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
Is it really tough

1248
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
To paint him as like

1249
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Like that this guy who's a

1250
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
The Sleeper Cell

1251
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,415
After a 45-year career

1252
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,231
I'm saying the exact same thing over and over again it's like

1253
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
Really his plan lasted fifth

1254
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
How long is planet supposed to last you just need to find other slippery ways to attack a minute

1255
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,751
You'll see you'll see a good better than easier

1256
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:41,151
Just playing a clip of bite you unless, you'd best go.

1257
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Care about James O'Keefe

1258
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,551
If you had an actual story that wasn't based on manipulative practices or fudging details

1259
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,855
He would do everything in his power to keep

1260
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
Keep his name off it

1261
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
I think that's a good life strategy to employ is anything that has a name project Veritas or James O'Keefe on it is apps

1262
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Blue balls

1263
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
Until it's verified or vetted through another outlet that has standards

1264
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Is just like

1265
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
Is to tarnish

1266
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,311
And it's just like whenever one of Alex's employees goes out but doesn't

1267
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Have the Infowars

1268
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
Microphone

1269
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,407
Like yeah you can't be associate

1270
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
With that if you

1271
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
If you want to get anything

1272
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
Speaking one of Alex's employees

1273
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,807
Is it goes out

1274
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
Alex

1275
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,927
What's the throw it to a report

1276
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,999
I'm going to go to some Kaitlin Bennett

1277
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,303
Feature

1278
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
So Kaitlin Bennett

1279
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Kind of embarrassed

1280
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,359
Stupid lately

1281
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
Some videos where she does not come off as

1282
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
Talking about all that much

1283
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,503
Albertsons

1284
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
That's not what this video

1285
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
Instead

1286
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Play another one

1287
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
I think it's a

1288
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
I want to be clear

1289
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:04,863
Alex is setting this up like it is a very serious piece of

1290
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,935
Like he said in that last this is what we're up

1291
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,007
This is yellow straightening the vicious

1292
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,567
Dangerousness of these

1293
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Willfully ignorant

1294
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Morons

1295
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
Father asking both hands lyrics

1296
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,783
I need to be clear

1297
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,879
This is setting it up as a serious report this isn't a comedy

1298
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Here's what the

1299
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
Premises

1300
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
Bruno the laptop becomes foreign policy experts overnight we're here in Toledo Ohio at the

1301
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,751
Trump rally to see if leftist can you do point to Iran on a map it's right here by the way

1302
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
This is some

1303
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,431
Media organization is desperate for contact when they pull out the

1304
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
Can you find a Ron on a map card

1305
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:59,135
If This Were a segment on a late night comedy show it be a little cheap and dumb but Alex is pretending he's doing the show that means something

1306
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
And yet

1307
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,463
You still think the segment like this is a good use of his time

1308
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,279
There are just a central problems with a bit like

1309
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,447
The first is that knowing where country is on a map is not an indication of knowledge or lack of knowledge about the current issues

1310
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
Surrounding that country

1311
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:18,847
You could be fairly well-read on the issues in the Middle East and not know exactly where countries are Geographic

1312
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,663
I mean obviously you'll be better if you did

1313
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Vallarta

1314
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,479
But it doesn't mean that you're not

1315
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
Thredup

1316
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
I'm not going to say

1317
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
That's ignorant

1318
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Is

1319
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:36,255
Berkeley fine however I do not think that knowing where Iran is on a map

1320
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
Matters when it comes

1321
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
Is it okay to Assassin

1322
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,935
Out of moral basis yeah it's it's like a different question

1323
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,799
I mean I guess it's okay to assassinate somebody because I don't know where they are

1324
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
O'Reilly Auto

1325
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:57,247
I'm concerned about a second problem is it that this will segment is based around the smugness the Kaitlin Bennett

1326
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:02,623
She actually has some kind of a Higher Ground over these dumb leftist because she knows where Ron is on a map

1327
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
A strong suspicion that she didn't

1328
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Know that before she prepped the sex

1329
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:10,303
I have a very strong suspicion that this whole thing could have gone

1330
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,119
I'm totally off the rails of someone after defined below

1331
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
On that map

1332
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:20,031
She likes to add jatate about refugees a lot so be interesting to see if she knows which countries are which in Central and South America

1333
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,895
This is the sort of segment anyone can do to paint any group they wanted

1334
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
It's the cheapest trick in the book

1335
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,271
Invalidate one side's position on an issue without even engaging in it at all

1336
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Very stupid

1337
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
But I wanted to point this out because

1338
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,927
This is a level of s*** that Alex is running with and thickness worth is

1339
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Time

1340
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Honestly

1341
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279
I think it's meant to be comedy segment

1342
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,327
Travis and presenting it that way

1343
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,375
Kaitlin Bennett isn't funny

1344
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,679
And because she's such a bochabela figure

1345
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,007
These videos just constantly end up with her just being made fun of

1346
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,567
Course it is video is no exception listen to this

1347
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:06,367
Otters

1348
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,975
People laughing

1349
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:17,375
Glasses don't make you a reporter that is the first lesson in journalism School

1350
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,935
Don't make sure they don't know much

1351
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Embarrassing

1352
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
Yeah I don't think that idea

1353
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
Cuz that's the premise of a Leto

1354
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,735
Man on the street shirt

1355
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Exactly

1356
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
But even then

1357
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
Their idea of

1358
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,951
Well I know something you don't know so I'm smarter than you and I can talk down to you

1359
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
It's so

1360
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:47,071
Because that means okay well now what if I know something you don't know

1361
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,631
The tables are turned and you're just

1362
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,959
To deal with it so you're going to cry like a little baby

1363
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
We go for that very serious report

1364
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
Very serious hard-hitting suffocate

1365
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Death to Alex of predicting that there's going to be a false flag

1366
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,255
Then they stage a false flag or they provocateur an action

1367
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
Jussie Smollett

1368
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
Dial the time steroids

1369
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
And then they say look

1370
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,983
The gun owners are the evil 2rsr the white supremacist

1371
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,311
And I run the same operation we saw the Democrat

1372
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Control State Police

1373
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,151
A couple years ago in Charlottesville

1374
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Whoa what

1375
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
It was a bunch of theater kids running around like a bunch of gay Theatre kids arousal and Nazis in Charlottesville

1376
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
That's what he

1377
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,511
His I mean it's resolved the tall black provocateur.

1378
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,791
No don't sweat it

1379
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:56,191
This is a prediction that he's making and he's you know doubles down on it

1380
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,263
It's very consistent this is what he is saying they're going to do

1381
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,359
Galaxy saying

1382
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,199
Aren't you making a big deal out of it

1383
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
Open with each state would back down but

1384
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,087
More and more it becomes very clear then try to pull something

1385
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
In Virginia

1386
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
And it all starts

1387
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
It's basically on the 20th

1388
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,327
Going to try to

1389
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,375
Krowd

1390
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
They're going to try to Stage something

1391
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
Begin gun confiscation and across the state

1392
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,359
In an attempt to trigger a civil war

1393
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:40,479
All this is just pre-emptive narrative building in case there is some sort of violent right-wing

1394
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:46,111
Extremist all that was the provocateur that the global asset into the crowd that's all just it's just preemptive self-defense

1395
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
At such

1396
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Disingenuous

1397
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Bulshit

1398
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
Like he's cheating

1399
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
So hard it makes

1400
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Right

1401
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,327
Yeah I know

1402
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,631
Still just disgraceful that like

1403
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,911
Oh no you know I'm

1404
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Just trying to deescalate things it's

1405
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,543
You spent the last three months being like what we got to do it now

1406
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Got to go hot

1407
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,383
Haven't started talking about it

1408
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
F*** you you don't get to

1409
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
To say that now

1410
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,735
No you certainly don't but he does

1411
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Feels

1412
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Awful because it's the present

1413
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
And you know things are still yet to happen

1414
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
Right

1415
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
It's terrible but it is

1416
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
It's exactly the same thing you see consistent

1417
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,911
Only with Alex

1418
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Yeah

1419
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
Course it is but it's such

1420
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Just like

1421
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,311
Ever not be mad at somebody

1422
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Cheating lie

1423
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
You know it's just

1424
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
It's

1425
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
The truck up

1426
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,527
I should be past they the right or wrong

1427
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Still getting

1428
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,367
Hung up every now and again you're going to get hung up like crazy on

1429
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,975
Because Alex makes a very bizarre recommendation

1430
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
And then tries to prove that the left

1431
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Launcher

1432
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,887
Go out, Kate Gunn

1433
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,447
As a nation we have to stand up to that

1434
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
When Governors trying it

1435
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,311
And people are like Mahatma Gandhi and turn them in

1436
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
They won't be able to start the Civil War

1437
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:16,479
But they'll just provocateur it maybe I was sniper shoot some anti-gunners

1438
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,807
I mean this is their playbook

1439
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
And it there

1440
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
Failing on every other front they already sent to my

1441
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,975
All the Patriot Republicans a baseball game

1442
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,327
Other Republicans

1443
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,887
Carlson's house

1444
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,727
Now the FBI and State

1445
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
Antifa

1446
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,031
Incel

1447
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,823
Plantera is a nationwide

1448
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Usher in a collapse

1449
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
The government

1450
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
Civil War

1451
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
So firstly it's kind of weird

1452
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,063
But I think people should comply with state level guns

1453
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,623
I guess that

1454
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
Interesting to hear

1455
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
I don't think that you means

1456
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,351
State-level bans guns in the left

1457
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
Have guns

1458
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,447
Is that why I could be like Gandhi and turn your gun in

1459
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,847
State-level for governor is doing it and then he's feeling on it

1460
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,687
Do that it'll cause a political backlash and then the state will turn red again

1461
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,575
That's what he should use Allstate

1462
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
It's right from Cheer

1463
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,903
I guess I'm glad to hear that

1464
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
I don't believe it

1465
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
Not for a

1466
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,583
But more importantly that list of incidents he's talking about with the last being violent is sad

1467
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,471
Is Steve scalise shooting was in June 2017 and there's literally no evidence that anyone quote sent him

1468
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Shoot those guys

1469
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,567
It seemed like his motivation was an intense hatred of Republican

1470
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
More than anything else

1471
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,407
And I was way out of line and plying me with some kind of an assassin

1472
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Consent by the globalist

1473
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,783
If Alex got deposed about that allegation

1474
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
He would 100% USA

1475
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
He's talking about his feel

1476
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,647
Feels like the shooter was

1477
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
Kill The Patriot

1478
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
Yeah

1479
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
I have no idea what he's talking about people saying to kill Trump or it's

1480
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Let's go Alex

1481
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,047
Let's do not specific

1482
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
For me to work with

1483
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,471
A small group of protesters went to Tucker Carlson's house in November 2018 and spent about 10 minutes chanting stuff

1484
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,263
Tucker wasn't even

1485
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
Tucker budzyn

1486
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
Steven home

1487
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:22,431
He claimed that the protesters were threatening to pipe bomb is house but according to people who were there this is a misrepresentation

1488
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Temptation of the protesters

1489
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
Evoking the pipe bomb

1490
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,271
Aberdeen Maga bomber

1491
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,319
And the recent synagogue shooting

1492
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
As a reason for why they were protesting

1493
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
His particular brand of rhetoric

1494
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:35,487
As they were leaving one straggler spray-painted an anarchist

1495
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,535
Stay on his driveway with other protesters

1496
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Express their disapproval

1497
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,119
The internet was completely brought up blown out of

1498
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,935
Proportion by the right-wing media and again happened over a year ago

1499
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,775
See what I listen to some of what they were

1500
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,079
Screaming and they were actually saying that his pipes

1501
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Sorbonne

1502
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
They really love his voice

1503
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,991
Oh I thought you meant a collection of glass weigh

1504
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,575
He's got a meerschaum pipe that's also go to hookah lounge

1505
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
So that's what we talked about earlier

1506
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,695
Dialysis

1507
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
Compared to the list of very real and actually deadly right-wing attacks in the same span of time Alex discovery

1508
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Also all left us this is

1509
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Legitimately

1510
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Apathetic

1511
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
It is

1512
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:20,799
Especially since he could just list all of the right-wing terrorist

1513
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
Yeah why is he listening

1514
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
Needle dick

1515
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
Yeah what is he listening

1516
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
I don't know

1517
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:33,599
That seems it seems like a slam-dunk to be like oh well it was this one it was this what it was this was Becky only remembers

1518
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,927
Certain touchpoints Rida

1519
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,743
Police all the time and

1520
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
Pretty in Tucker Carlson

1521
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
These days so

1522
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
Bring them up

1523
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,423
Little more about how he would turn his guns in

1524
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,191
If

1525
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,751
Texas band

1526
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
Alright while

1527
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,847
Texas

1528
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,687
Close to it

1529
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:03,551
They tried something like this and wanted to have a big Riot and wanted to blame it on President Trump

1530
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
And I came to take my guns

1531
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
This point

1532
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
Would turn them in

1533
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,303
Knowing they were wanting a civil war then that would trigger such a political movement

1534
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,351
Go back red

1535
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:22,751
You're an idiot

1536
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:29,151
Try to fix this peacefully we're winning politically stable

1537
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Trigger a war law enforcement

1538
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
Okay

1539
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,807
Politically that's why she want to overthrow the chessboard

1540
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Yeah

1541
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
I strongly suspected Alex's saying you would comply with state level gun ban because he knows that many of the folks on the writer

1542
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,583
Very publicly talking about shooting cops who come to take their gun

1543
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,399
This feels like an attempt at presenting a moderate public

1544
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:55,775
Face knowing that the work has already been done in terms of radicalizing enough people to make the world super dangerous

1545
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,615
Although I have heard in some like recent episode some people like

1546
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
Pushing back on it

1547
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:06,271
And for The Stance of like I would turn my guns into maybe you should

1548
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
Cops

1549
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:13,695
Call yousoldout yourself

1550
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
You created this audio

1551
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
Copy the face I don't know I have no idea why my audience feels like I would shoot

1552
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,263
The cop in the face if they said to take my gun to other than the past

1553
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
10 years where I've said that it's our constitutional duty to shoot a cop in the face if they come to try and take your gun if you come to drive

1554
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
You literally said if you come for my guns

1555
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
I will shoot you

1556
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
1776.

1557
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,391
Again did you think so

1558
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
So Alex

1559
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
Main point

1560
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Is there

1561
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
They're trying to start a war out of this

1562
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
That's sure

1563
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
The whole like

1564
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
The big thing

1565
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
Cuz I don't do that

1566
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,007
Do the Infowars

1567
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:04,383
I'm not going to do

1568
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
And show

1569
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
We're winning politically

1570
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
The left is self-destruct

1571
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Dislike

1572
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,975
Who's going to win out of the

1573
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Baltimore face

1574
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,815
Civil War

1575
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Bart Deering

1576
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
That's it

1577
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
Dial next week will be on the ground in d.c.

1578
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
Just miles away in Northern Virginia

1579
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
Revolutionary War

1580
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Well

1581
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
Boston in the North End

1582
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Virginia the South

1583
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
Quick fact check the

1584
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:50,719
Heard round the world Richmond Virginia and Concord so

1585
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:57,119
Damn time he screamed about The Oath Keepers rally at Lexington Green for like a week during the Boston bombing time.

1586
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:03,519
Symbol with a revolutionary war started Asheville will talk more about this a little bit

1587
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,359
Alex makes it even bigger claim that's nonsense

1588
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,663
That these just way off

1589
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,735
Boston in the northern Virginia

1590
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:17,599
Stuff to make historical parallels

1591
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,671
Because he desperately wants something horrible to happen in Virginia

1592
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,023
You don't want to solve things with an infowar cuz he knows all his talking points aren't true

1593
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,839
Trump is not super popular the impeachment is

1594
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
Not super unpopular

1595
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,679
The Texas threat assessment he's lying about

1596
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,263
Clearly says it white racially motivated terrorism most violent type

1597
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:38,079
Gen Z is not on this dumb Patriot Bowl

1598
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
Most voters

1599
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,895
Do favor some country

1600
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Control measures

1601
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,551
He doesn't want to go with a sensible rational root because he loses that every single time

1602
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
Everything is just b*******

1603
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Anyway

1604
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
You heard there

1605
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
They want to do this

1606
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,999
Yes while Trump is in

1607
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Being impeached

1608
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,327
In the trial in the Senate because

1609
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
He'll be distracted

1610
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,679
Wow so we won't be able to

1611
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Quizlet

1612
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,751
That's not so much with okay alright

1613
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,775
Alex Bell.

1614
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:12,127
Conspiracy a little bit here and now apparently it's mostly about getting Trump out of office

1615
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
But I thought they wanted to start

1616
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
Do you know what

1617
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,735
Let's just roll with it

1618
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
And the governor

1619
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:25,951
Is basically talking about going ahead and having gun confiscation don't hadn't having gun registration

1620
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
When

1621
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:31,583
Where is already declaring emergency at the idea of an emergency going

1622
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,863
In your head

1623
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
Can trigger

1624
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,727
Some type of civil unrest

1625
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,055
Civil War in the region

1626
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
And martial law

1627
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,663
President Trump used to blame

1628
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,967
And then removing him while the shinning

1629
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
In session

1630
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
Next week with a trial

1631
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,879
Bob the president all the planets

1632
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,975
Aligning right now and our intel was the governor was planning this

1633
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Now you see it's beginning console

1634
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,375
Pictures of jussie Smollett type false flag but a billion times bigger

1635
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,191
I believe we're not going to be getting away with it

1636
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
You notice

1637
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
Also have

1638
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,567
Das bombshell videos

1639
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
With this operative for Sanders

1640
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,663
The weathermen

1641
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:21,503
Pan books

1642
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
Are the main

1643
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,999
Terrace rent and they track

1644
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
The country it's been

1645
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,911
Incels tearing out almost all of the mass shootings

1646
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,239
Tied together

1647
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,311
So In that clip you can kind of see the anatomy of this

1648
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
Conspiracy cycle

1649
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
And I think that Alex isn't

1650
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,175
Like super comfortable with all of the

1651
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
The pieces of it yet

1652
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
And so that way you can kind of see his brain trying to jump

1653
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Connect them Gap

1654
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:02,463
The end message Alex wants his audience to get is the last particularly antifa in cell Demon's are coming to put you in a fever

1655
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:09,375
I suspected this is at least partially based on Alex realizing they yellow but Hillary is not going to sustain him this election cycle

1656
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
Matt is best

1657
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
Play is probably to really

1658
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,215
A sphere of burning

1659
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
Even though in 2016 you wouldn't

1660
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,103
Stop talking about how unfairly Bernie was treated when he was trying to use that to attack Hillary

1661
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,127
And in the past

1662
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,223
You called Bernie the only good Senator on the left because he works with Ron Paul

1663
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:30,879
Getting oversight for the Federal Reserve but who cares about any of that we got fear to self

1664
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,695
Because he wanted to be unfair to Bernie

1665
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
The Heat

1666
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
So the goal is that sort of a conclusion

1667
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
So you really need

1668
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,375
Pieces that you know in place to support that can

1669
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Conclusion

1670
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,775
Luckily this b******* artist James O'Keefe put out a thing related to Bernie and gulags that's a good start

1671
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Who this

1672
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,359
Texas threat assessment came out mentioned in cells

1673
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:54,687
Just pretend that the whole thing is about antifa in cells doing all the violence

1674
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
That should help back up the fear

1675
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
That the audience should feel based on this O'Keefe video

1676
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,623
Now to make it all feel super immediately liked it

1677
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
Imminent crisis

1678
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:10,303
Let's mix in some of the stuff we ripped off from Hell Turner's hoax about Governor Northam declaring martial law to seize guns

1679
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
A good measure just throwing some

1680
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,167
I'm stuff but how this has to do with getting rid of trump getting him out of office

1681
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
Pico de gallo

1682
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,775
This is what's going on here these are the pieces of the narrative that

1683
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
Meant to drive towards

1684
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
The desired

1685
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,359
Conclusion

1686
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
It's it's

1687
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,663
Seems like what he

1688
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
What he thinks he's doing

1689
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
Or maybe doesn't think

1690
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
He's doing but what he's funk

1691
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
Actually doing

1692
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:34,111
Is trying to give people who otherwise would be against domestic

1693
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
The

1694
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
Safety of saying well

1695
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,255
Because they're not domestic terrorism by side

1696
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,303
And they're the ones on their side to make it look

1697
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
Like my side is bad when the theoretical Civil War does stark

1698
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,167
I'm fighting a defensive War

1699
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,983
Not I'm part of America

1700
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
The right-wing

1701
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,591
Is the one who's doing and the rationalization for that largely has to do with

1702
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
If we don't do this

1703
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,943
Antifa

1704
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,527
Put you and your family in a FEMA camp barely targeting us

1705
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
Because yeah

1706
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,111
None of these pieces of the puzzle are real

1707
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,647
That he'll turn himself in

1708
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,207
Completely made up by white supremacists trying to get people to

1709
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
Freak out

1710
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,767
Alex is just making stuff up about the

1711
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,095
Texas threat assessment order to cover for white identity motivated Terror

1712
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,143
Is James O'Keefe

1713
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
There's nothing real

1714
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,495
It's all bulshit but it's meant to make his audience scared

1715
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
I'm feeling under threat

1716
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
Because that's super profitable

1717
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:29,151
And like you said it leads them to normalize and

1718
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
Except

1719
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,783
Because they might not otherwise and it gives them the ability to

1720
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
To both say that they're against

1721
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,135
Domestic terrorism while at the same time

1722
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
Friday

1723
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
Terrorist War I go

1724
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Epsom salt

1725
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
You know what really

1726
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Jordan

1727
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
The governor declared

1728
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,167
Yes obviously

1729
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
Means the guns are going to be take

1730
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,263
I don't think that's how it works but okay

1731
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:02,175
Emergency at the Capitol in the grounds

1732
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
Because people coming with guns

1733
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,527
Introducing the idea of a civil emergency

1734
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:13,183
Why does the president trial will undoubtedly be taking place next weekend will be there covering both

1735
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,279
That's my whole main cruise to be the rim

1736
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
15 people there

1737
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
Do your calls in one minute

1738
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
I just want to say that it takes a lot of money to do this

1739
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,983
We are expanding our backup Reserve to do

1740
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,055
We are going to have a security team of quite a few people up there

1741
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:33,407
Police officers from the locales I'll just leave it at that

1742
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,223
Because this is a major threat area for everybody

1743
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,415
I need to find her operation

1744
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:49,023
Natural fjords salmon

1745
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
Good

1746
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:59,775
Natural at the artificial heart

1747
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:05,919
They're Alex implying that he's in coordination with the local cops

1748
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Unheard-of regularly

1749
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
You could be talkin

1750
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,551
I have no idea

1751
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:16,671
I think there's one thing they're the end that I think is kind of an interesting thing and that is that like

1752
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
If Alex isn't lying about the

1753
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,023
The Tight money situation

1754
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
F****** terrible idea

1755
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,655
He has to think that he's going to get so much price out of this

1756
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,751
Justify whatever expenses

1757
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
Star I have no idea

1758
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
I think it could be an indication that maybe he's been

1759
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
Overselling

1760
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
How bad does

1761
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
Financial situation

1762
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,455
He really is just like

1763
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
Desperate

1764
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,087
Largely due to the point of the

1765
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
It's easy for Alex to say the governor Northam declared an emergency

1766
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
Because people were going to bring Gun

1767
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Monster rally

1768
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,767
But that's not really being precise enough

1769
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
Put your language

1770
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,167
If people were just going to show up to peacefully assemble and carry guns there's no doubt that it would not have been an issue

1771
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,727
This is technically about people bring gone

1772
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,823
More specifically about these sorts of people were planning to bring those guns

1773
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,151
Because of people like Alex we've been building up the

1774
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,711
Turn the next civil war is about to start because Virginia

1775
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Considering

1776
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,015
Mi gun

1777
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,831
A lot of really extreme folks have been drawn into the picture

1778
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,927
This entire thing to completely spiraled out of control to the point where I don't even think

1779
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
The gun supporters even really know what

1780
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
Expect now

1781
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
You know you have this double talk

1782
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Meant to be

1783
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,583
Kind of winking

1784
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Came all over the place

1785
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
Yes people from the Pulaski

1786
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,727
Tri-County Second Amendment Coalition putting out statement stressing

1787
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,543
If you're going to do it legal s*** you need to stay home

1788
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
And at the same time

1789
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,383
You have Philip Van Cleave saying quote

1790
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,687
It's ironic that this is a gun right

1791
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,503
It's in the governor is trying to take away our ability to carry guns

1792
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,087
How ironic is that he keeps poking the bear you know

1793
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,439
Thesaurus super extreme but self-contradictory messaging is

1794
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
It's a recipe for a chaotic situation

1795
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:01,375
It's a real-life and way more volatile version of Alex rambling out pornographic leave Vivid description

1796
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Killing his enemies

1797
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,959
And then existing is all about the information

1798
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:09,311
It allows them to antagonize and wink at the extreme members of the audience

1799
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
Well reassuring

1800
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,895
Extreme listeners is really just about to begin

1801
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
Seems sort of

1802
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Dynamic

1803
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
Is being played by

1804
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,783
Some of these people who are involved with that

1805
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
The gun side of the rally

1806
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,855
They're signaling to a

1807
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,135
Stream folks

1808
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
Wow

1809
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
Playing the

1810
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
About the infowar

1811
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
Different

1812
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
So

1813
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
I don't know it's

1814
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,887
It's not good I mean

1815
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,703
Impossible for them to not know

1816
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,471
That's

1817
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
The threat is

1818
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
Credible

1819
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:45,151
The worst part about the perfect

1820
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,735
One of the members of the fandom

1821
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,783
Infiltrated the alt-right

1822
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,087
Chat boards and and

1823
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,111
Discordant message

1824
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
More than all of that stuff

1825
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
Fairly easily

1826
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
I don't doubt that the

1827
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Cops

1828
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
Can do the exact

1829
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
They have the will

1830
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,839
You know that's always been

1831
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,631
More the issue then

1832
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Anything else

1833
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,215
Yeah and I want it and it appears that they were

1834
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,495
They were surveilling

1835
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Bass

1836
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
South

1837
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
Couldn't have been that hard

1838
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
They're not great

1839
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:22,528
Yeah I don't know I don't know I'm not a in intimately involved so I don't know maybe it's difficult maybe it's not but

1840
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,088
Yeah I don't believe

1841
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
Did people like Alex

1842
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
People like Stuart roads

1843
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
Are unaware

1844
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,720
That element of

1845
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:35,584
And that's why they need to present it as they're trying to demonize all gun owners as opposed to

1846
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
Discussing the very real Fringe

1847
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
Streamelements

1848
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,192
Yeah being attractive

1849
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
Because they

1850
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
They don't have it

1851
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,056
Answer that also don't want to denounce those people

1852
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,848
Right if they like it

1853
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,384
Because they're good

1854
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
But

1855
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,200
If there are

1856
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,760
State-level laws go to turn in your guns

1857
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
But if there's Federal

1858
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,600
I just Jordan

1859
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
No

1860
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,256
You got to go to Walmart

1861
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,864
Organized Federal

1862
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
Starbucks we got to go to war

1863
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,216
Okay and I'm not looking for that but I'll go to war

1864
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,288
That's not our government that criminal it's on American

1865
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
The fight against it

1866
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,944
The Democrats are trying to start

1867
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,808
I know our people.

1868
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,672
Alex knows that which is interesting because recently Stewart Roads is giving a speech

1869
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
Why do we listen to a little bit of

1870
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
So just looking at down the road

1871
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
Truck furniture

1872
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
One better in time one gun

1873
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
That's what we going to do

1874
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,104
No

1875
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,920
Butterfinger Butterfinger where you're at

1876
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,016
That's why you

1877
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
That's why you need

1878
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
The Neighbors Bar

1879
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
You're sure be behind you

1880
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:25,920
The game says the audience member guys over 60 just shoot cops

1881
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Succumb to take gun

1882
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,528
Will loosen old timers.

1883
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,552
And Stewart Roads

1884
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:37,440
A better answer is Sheriff but I agree with that sentiment

1885
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,744
I think it's the mark of a courageous

1886
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
Send perf

1887
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,792
Victorian ization

1888
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,816
2

1889
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,888
Sacrifice be elderly in the altar of their War

1890
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,472
Were there.

1891
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,544
Alex is a close associate of Stuart Road

1892
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:57,408
4 years and I have definitely heard collars on Alex's show Express

1893
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,224
That exact same sentiment that guy the audio

1894
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,064
This is the idea that Alex thinks that no one is

1895
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,880
Going to shoot the good idea to shoot

1896
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
Papa never happen

1897
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,744
It's pretty regular occurrence

1898
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Yeah

1899
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
So Alex

1900
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,864
I don't I don't know how he's done this

1901
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,936
Yes but I guess at this point he's confirmed that the globalist

1902
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,008
The blinding of false

1903
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,032
Wow

1904
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:29,408
The police aren't our enemy the globalist want to make it that way they want source of War

1905
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
I'm going to be there

1906
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,624
How do we stop it what are they going to pull what are the policeman

1907
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Sodick

1908
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,488
The Deep Statesboro you know they're planning this it's been confirmed

1909
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,792
How you confirmed it

1910
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
Yes really getting too specific

1911
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,144
Empire

1912
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
Didn't you see Pepper Road

1913
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Kind of

1914
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:00,128
Post on a Facebook page

1915
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
Confirm

1916
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,688
Alex Costa calls

1917
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,248
And he get the call allegedly

1918
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,040
From Virginia car

1919
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,576
And he asked

1920
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
This guy

1921
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,880
How how can I avoid

1922
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,696
So I'm just asking how do we somehow

1923
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Not let this happen

1924
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:21,120
I wish I had the answer for you Alex because everything I could possibly

1925
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,656
Answer is something

1926
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,680
Going to be a counter to

1927
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
And

1928
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,776
I just think at the end of the day there's going to be people there they're going to try to

1929
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,080
Something I don't believe they're going to be involved

1930
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
And the Patriots

1931
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
I just think there's going to be

1932
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,248
Passionate people

1933
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
You been talking about

1934
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,232
There's no doubt that they're so desperate because they're losing politically this is what they're going to try

1935
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:53,632
So I apologize I believe there was a former Virginia Campos now in a different place

1936
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,168
A couple of cop car okay

1937
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,776
This is an insanely irresponsible kind of think we put it on there

1938
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:04,128
The conclusions that these two people Alex in this guy if they breach

1939
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,944
Before anything has happened days before the rally even happen

1940
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:12,320
Some kind of horrible tragedy is going to happen they're into it won't be there side the Dozen

1941
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,880
I probably talk about this too much

1942
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,720
Watch but this is one of the ways that Alex make sure that no matter what happens

1943
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,536
To prevent present himself as the winner and the hero in this

1944
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Situation

1945
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,912
If God forbid something bad happens at the rally he's on record pretending he's proven

1946
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
To his audience

1947
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
At the globalist

1948
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
They're going to false Flags he's been proven right

1949
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,800
If nothing happened to get to pretend that

1950
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,080
Unit Patriot Buddies

1951
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
You're so strong

1952
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,664
Intimidating look Global said call an audible

1953
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,712
Decided not to false flag after all

1954
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,248
Solutely no matter what

1955
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
Autostraddle

1956
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
And his ability to keep his audience

1957
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,624
Convinced he knows what he's talking about remains intact

1958
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,160
And he's able to move forward

1959
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
This is a game time

1960
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,720
It's really f***** up

1961
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,744
Considering the stakes

1962
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
He's doing

1963
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,840
And if they do call inaudible and they don't do the false

1964
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,608
Flag

1965
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,144
That just means they're going to do it at

1966
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,544
The different time so you always got to be ready for the false flag, always the end time preacher

Another guy

And I think Alex thinks he's gone

1988
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,648
To be way more sensible than he

1989
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,440
I'm not even positive this guy

1990

All we have to go on is that

1991
01:26:54,976 --> 01:27:00,864
The caller says that there are caught I don't even know I think this guy's pretend exact is real too

1992
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,656
Now we have Willard

1993
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,216
State Police in Virginia

1994
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,008
Amish objects

1995
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,824
Thanks for calling

1996
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
I control rats

1997
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
Spell Alex

1998
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,152
First of all

1999
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:16,224
People shouldn't be voting and counties to

2000
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,808
Sanctuary cities they ought to be arresting this guy

2001
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,160
Program

2002
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
Military

2003
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,256
Thomas running this thing

2004
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,608
Obama still running our government placed in the government

2005
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,216
Ignore Trump or they'll indict them and

2006
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
And the people just scared and

2007
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,384
People just frustrated but I tell you this Alex if they go ahead and go on with this I'm all wrong with it

2008
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Because

2009
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,224
American people are stupid for putting up with it

2010
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
Punching jail

2011
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:05,376
How's your right of the American people to put up with this text

2012
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
Yeah BS

2013
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:13,056
Why did Alex agree with them being like yeah, I'm going to take your guns if you didn't cuz you all are stupid

2014
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,616
I have no idea

2015
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
Are wild

2016
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:22,784
Obama still running the government and I don't think that's what Alex wanted to hear because that's

2017
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,576
Something

2018
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,160
Before but that's not this season's content

2019
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
Yeah

2020
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:34,048
Derek that's what that's the kind of thing you want to bring up when there's like deep State entry kind of narratives going around

2021
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
I'd like we need an easy

2022
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,680
Today just explanation for why your hero Trump isn't doing any of this stuff you want them to

2023
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:42,752
That's when you tried out the Obama still running the government stuff

2024
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
This season right now

2025
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,848
It Patriot masturbation season

2026
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
Contact making

2027
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
Excuses for things throwing blame on people who clearly not run

2028
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,504
The government doesn't play that well

2029
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,088
We are trying to get people whipped into a frenzy about standing up to the gun grabbers

2030
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:02,720
Alex was looking for something more along the lines of I do 100 cops will kill their superiors before taking gun

2031
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,256
That's what you wanted

2032
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,072
It does seem like there is a

2033
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:11,424
Kind of significant amount of cognitive dissonance nostalgia

2034
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,960
These people like

2035
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:17,312
I miss whenever my life was better under Obama and I was still allowed to do

2036
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
Adam Wright

2037
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,872
And now my life is worse

2038
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,432
But I'm supposed to like this guy but

2039
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
He sucks

2040
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:31,136
I hate Obama still VA for fun yelling about Obama and Hillary

2041
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
The guy who's clearly eBay

2042
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
Yeah this is a bummer

2043
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,744
This guy Rambles

2044
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,024
Surprise

2045
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,120
And he's voting machines are these voting machines are as what

2046
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
Spilled all over this country

2047
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,640
And it ready to jump on as soon as

2048
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
If it doesn't

2049
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,224
Always ready

2050
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Go ahead and

2051
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,320
She's other states

2052
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,368
Bunch of sleepers

2053
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,392
And it's

2054
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
And I hate to see it but like I said

2055
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,256
If they pass away

2056
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,536
I'm going to rescue

2057
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,376
Animal do what they told me that I'm not going door-to-door

2058
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
That's what the other people

2059
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:19,008
Dictionary

2060
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,288
And I don't want that

2061
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,336
People need to wake up and do some

2062
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,640
Don't have to be on the deuce

2063
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,456
Let's expand on that

2064
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,016
Domestic terrorism threat assessment

2065
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,648
Report on the number one terrorist

2066
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,720
The FBI came out said that the main threat

2067
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Is leftist

2068
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,024
Antifa

2069
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Ladies and gentlemen

2070
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
They are going out doing the majority of the mass shootings

2071
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
Consciously

2072
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
Define the Second Amendment

2073
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,568
So again you have this Texas threat assessment being brought up completely deceptively

2074
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,640
Is one of the only things that he's really trying to push

2075
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Super hard

2076
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,224
Again I don't know why he's not addressing

2077
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
Willard wants

2078
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,832
To take his guns on the road

2079
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,904
Anyway Willard says some stupid Earth

2080
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:14,048
Another thing to email anymore

2081
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
He's God

2082
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,888
How many more

2083
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,008
Giuliani's parallel dilbar

2084
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,080
Call when billboard don't deliver by this election

2085
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:31,968
Call Juliana

2086
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,272
I think that might be a conflict of interest

2087
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,600
Further than that Giuliani guilty of a lot of s***

2088
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:42,208
I do believe that there was a time maybe then right when Trump was elected that maybe

2089
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,328
Maybe Rudy Giuliani could have been the attorney general not a f******

2090
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:52,192
I don't think I would do that to confirm attorney general nominees

2091
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
And I have no face

2092
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,008
The Giuliani could clear that hurdle

2093
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Dirk Nowitzki

2094
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:00,896
It's so incredibly painted right now like he's been all over the media.

2095
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:07,296
Weird interviews for the last year is big step in this Ukraine business we deeper than he has any reason to be occasionally

2096
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,600
Devon interview

2097
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
Don't get me wrong I think

2098
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:15,488
Those would be some of the most amazing confirmation hearings imaginable

2099
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,536
Like an entertainment standpoint but

2100
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,352
In terms of it being a feasible plan there's no way that

2101
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
That's never going to happen

2102
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,472
Stop talking about Hillary's emails cuz he has them

2103
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,288
You stop talking about them because he got what you wanted out of

2104
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Talkin about the

2105
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,872
And bring them back up now doesn't do him any good

2106
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
He's not running against

2107
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,456
Hillary to bring up her emails be kind of a week

2108
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
And even Trump knows.

2109
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:44,160
Honestly this dude who Alex is presenting is a real wise Insider by virtue of them saying that he's a cop in Virginia

2110
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,000
Really seems like a regular ass Alex Jones listener

2111
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
Some dumb ideas he's presenting as the

2112
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,096
The truth there's all these they're all about

2113
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:58,496
To drop these bills and all these indictments and everything is right around the corner if this thing doesn't happen or

2114
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,800
This thing does happen what's next

2115
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
We're going to drop

2116
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,384
AG Rudy Rudy is coming in

2117
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,456
Putting them on their shoulder

2118
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
Put me in coach

2119
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,272
That caller was

2120
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Full of bad idea

2121
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
Yes yes

2122
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:16,416
Alex gets another collar it's actually kind of scares me

2123
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
And I believe that

2124
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,424
My number with you ear your peers there if you want to get back in touch with me

2125
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
With me please

2126
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
So I've got

2127
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,264
I'm trying to keep my phone

2128
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
Involved in Lotto

2129
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,456
I've got a lot of guys here to Farmers Federal police

2130
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:44,576
Military and things like that so what what I'll do is be in Virginia

2131
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:48,928
We've also got some of the guys robbing the truck up there so I appreciate your call

2132
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
That's not good

2133
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,840
Wanna start something in Virginia

2134
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,168
It sounds like

2135
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:02,496
Most the FBI has

2136
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,776
But they're not communist

2137
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,824
They're not globolixo

2138
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,176
What rap artist Lee I'm sure has FBI task force is down Virginia right now

2139
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:14,528
On the ground surveillance the Left End of antifa

2140
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:18,112
Still walking around and not in prison

2141
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Yesterday I was asking for that

2142
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,560
The 2015 plan for martial law in Maryland

2143
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:32,192
This color clearly wants to talk to Alex about stuff that may or may not be cool to talk about on air

2144
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
That's awesome

2145
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:38,080
He's clearly struggling to speak without saying the wrong things Alex's wise to cut him off

2146
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,616
Before he went to far

2147
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Also Alex goes with that

2148
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,712
Stack everything that antifa and Soros are terrorists

2149
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,736
Suspiciously apps

2150
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:48,064
Confirm that stacker news of the articles about the two groups of members of the base

2151
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,624
Or arrested I'm just being a dick.

2152
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,392
Reported

2153
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,696
Until the day after it's out

2154
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,560
It's just funny though that those stories are going to be coming out the next day

2155
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,096
What else is working with is

2156
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,120
Fake Soros and

2157
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,680
Antifa contract is intern found on 4chan

2158
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,728
That's what level of things

2159
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Things that are

2160
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,056
I think Trump's 2020 campaign slogan is

2161
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,848
It's just going to be I know you are but what am I

2162
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,128
Neener neener

2163
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,456
We're not terrorists

2164
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
Is jet is a slogan

2165
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
I'm just going to be

2166
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,784
Yeah

2167
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,392
So Alex gets another caller who's that what you know

2168
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
Real dumb

2169
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,232
Two days ago about ended past all those things about

2170
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,328
All those are in the general assembly and white

2171
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,352
That same date

2172
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,912
Active shooter hoax

2173
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:44,128
You can look it up try to share that and put it on screen but it was pretty much

2174
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,688
Student called texting

2175
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
He was an active shooter

2176
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:51,296
Middle schools in Virginia

2177
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,392
I'm not exactly sure what this collar strongest

2178
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:59,232
Suggest about this active shooter hoax but I assume he thinks that this is what happened

2179
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,584
The bubbles trying to push these bills through State Legislature that already

2180
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,400
Absolutely has enough votes to pass them

2181
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:11,776
They create a hoax active shooting at a middle school in Virginia to grease the wheels

2182
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,848
So this color brings out the shooting hoax

2183
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
Suspicious

2184
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,664
This analysis responses

2185
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Convenia

2186
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:22,272
Is it the condescendingly imply that of course the hoax in the bills are connect

2187
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
Haha

2188
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Here's the problem

2189
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:29,696
According to wtvr local news in Henrico County

2190
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:34,304
The police received the alert about the shooting through their new text to 911 capabilities

2191
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,400
Because people can just text things in there's often not inability to come

2192
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,192
Confirm things are ask follow-up questions

2193
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
Before you need to act

2194
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
If someone texts

2195
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,776
911 that there's an

2196
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,568
Active shooting and you're the dispatcher

2197
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:49,664
There's no chance in hell you're going to wait around and see if they replied your response text

2198
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
Before sending out units

2199
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:55,808
Way too serious a situation sorry my battery died

2200
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
Respond to your 911

2201
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
Right

2202
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:02,208
So I guess the conspiracy has to be that the globalist sent the text

2203
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
2911

2204
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
Problem

2205
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
There

2206
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,584
Where is that the police get the phone numbers

2207
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Upheaval sending the text

2208
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,936
And they traced it to a twelve-year-old girl who goes to the schooling

2209
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,752
So I guess then the conspiracy has to be that the

2210
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,032
The globalist use this

2211
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,848
12 year old girls phone number to text in the hoax

2212
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,176
But the problem there is that the police geo-located

2213
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,992
Phone is being inside a first for classroom

2214
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:30,624
In the school when the text was sent

2215
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,416
This girl's phone and used it to send the hoax

2216
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
Message from the school without anyone noticing

2217
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
Sing anything weird

2218
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,280
Like a globalist in the classroom

2219
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,816
Or the simpler X

2220
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
Explanation of younger

2221
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:40,864
The really stupid

2222
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:47,008
Maybe seems more like it's really unusual to see

2223
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,312
Ghetto Kids between the age of

2224
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,080
12 in

2225
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,360
17 doing

2226
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,408
Stupid things that could get them in trouble

2227
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,944
Never ever happened

2228
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,712
That seems odd

2229
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,736
Probably the globe

2230
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:02,624
Got2b the globe between 12 and 17

2231
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,464
Another problem is that this shooting scare happened on Monday January 3rd

2232
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,256
By the evening of the 13th

2233
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:11,840
It was clear that this was a situation where someone to text it in a roni esquer

2234
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:14,656
It was all over the news that night that this wasn't a real Act

2235
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Shooting

2236
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,496
The Virginia Senate didn't vote on these bills until Thursday the 6th

2237
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,544
The motive makes no sense

2238
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,128
The supposed process of how this would be some kind of an elaborate set-up make

2239
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
Makes no sense

2240
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:31,808
To disconnected events that are easily explained on their own and actually become pretty nonsensical when you try to connect

2241
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,856
At least they are if you think

2242
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
Even a little

2243
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
They both

2244
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
Kind of have to do with guns

2245
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
These two things

2246
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
Announces train these Dum Dums

2247
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,120
In his audience to think that everything that happens is part of the

2248
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
Conspiracy

2249
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,168
That snapshot

2250
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,216
Alex saying isn't that convenient

2251
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,264
Perfectly captures would an idiot

2252
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,824
He has no idea what this caller is talking

2253
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,616
About there's no anything about this story

2254
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
He's perfectly happy to reinforce this

2255
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Kind of think

2256
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,016
The kind of thinking to just randomly connect independent things

2257
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
Noted about conspiracy

2258
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,600
Now I will positivist

2259
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
Perhaps

2260
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
The globalist

2261
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,256
Have every twelve-year-old in the United States under their can

2262
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:19,168
Maybe they had one Good Year where they just got everybody you know they swept up the whole twelve-year-old generator

2263
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,704
Right there

2264
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,520
15

2265
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
What someone who's 12

2266
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,616
Right now 2008

2267
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:35,808
It was all about

2268
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
That makes more sense in there

2269
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
So Alex gets into some

2270
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:48,096
Something now that I think is amazing I think is one of my favorite things and

2271
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,120
The dog barks

2272
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:52,960
There's a bee sting there's something that carries on when your feelings

2273
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:57,056
There's somebody carries on through the rest of this episode

2274
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
Surprised by but

2275
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Also

2276
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
I should I should have

2277
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:04,736
And they also contact gungrave since David Jones on

2278
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,552
Get your podium in Virginia next

2279
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:25,216
The leftist media We Built For This audience

2280
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
It seems like

2281
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:37,760
The gun organizations in Virginia even don't want a spare that must be heartbreaking for him to have them

2282
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
Distance themselves from

2283
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,088
But I put armor Alex

2284
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:47,488
Hey you're too hot man I can do hot with his Daddy hugs.

2285
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
Hope to have you but you're standing up

2286
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:53,376
So sorry I heard that I was like wow that's a weird slip

2287
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Clearly indicating

2288
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,960
That has projector they speaking

2289
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,752
Diego

2290
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,056
But I didn't expect it would come back up

2291
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,848
But it does

2292
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
Veterans

2293
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,920
Personally

2294
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
Barre method

2295
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,528
Play this next court balance is talking

2296
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
About how

2297
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,392
Individual officers

2298
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,440
In the military or in

2299
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,208
The police

2300
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,792
If they get an order that they think is unlawful

2301
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:26,144
They should shoot their Superior know okay alright

2302
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,960
Now baby that would be fine if we're talking Nazi

2303
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,240
Baby

2304
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,776
Even then I still think that

2305
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,848
Whatever awfully right

2306
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,248
When they graduate boot camp

2307
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,272
Explaining

2308
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:47,136
Wobble wobble

2309
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:54,048
They need to not follow orders that are unlawful or heads up

2310
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,840
Do that you turn to shoot him in the head

2311
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,912
Goes from there from legal orders are you

2312
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,640
Just a quick reminder the Trump is recently pardon war criminal

2313
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,920
Before Trump

2314
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:16,064
I guess I think that's what I would say I think it's a dangerous mentality to

2315
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,344
Advance

2316
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,672
Bet that did that you should be the sole arbiter

2317
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:28,608
Kill your general should be at least one step between

2318
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,912
Saying yes

2319
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,192
And then murder

2320
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,520
I would say there's to be like maybe mediation

2321
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,544
Let me be clear

2322
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,592
I think this applies across the board

2323
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,896
I'm strongly in favor of workers right

2324
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,272
Let's say that your boss breaks a labor law no

2325
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
No

2326
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,624
I mean well but the Nuremberg defense would apply

2327
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
So

2328
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:54,464
What you going to do are you going to do I was just following orders

2329
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:59,328
So Alex saying is next clip says it

2330
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,376
Manuel's

2331
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,704
So Alex said it's like they're business just sort of vague

2332
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,496
Just ordered it is so wait till they are

2333
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,824
He's really encouraging that everybody's got to go to

2334
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:15,712
I'm going to

2335
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,528
Be there

2336
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
And

2337
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,136
We're doing it because

2338
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:26,464
Delete everybody to understand that you need to be in Virginia

2339
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,744
Bmdc

2340
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,560
Bowser pick one

2341
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,352
Take the kids out of school

2342
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
Do whatever you got to

2343
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,448
So he's are advocating this

2344
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:39,520
Like civilians go into a chaotic

2345
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,824
Situation where he's already said he

2346
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,384
Expect the globalist are going to pull a false flag

2347
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:48,480
That seems irresponsible okay if he believes what he's saying

2348
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
You putting

2349
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,528
People in the path of danger

2350
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,320
Right and that is not good

2351
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:57,696
Okay so the globalists are going to pull a false flag and blame gun owners

2352
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,488
Hours for it where assumably

2353
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
People are going to

2354
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,584
So what I would like for all of my listener

2355
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:09,984
To do is gather together in that space put more people in a smaller area of space

2356
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,872
Keeping people from getting hurt correct I guess if you really believe this sort of thing is

2357
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,152
Potentially dangerous

2358
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,200
The thing you would say is

2359
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,248
If you don't need to go

2360
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
People should not

2361
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,344
Come for no reason

2362
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
It should be 88

2363
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,696
You don't need to go

2364
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,232
No just don't

2365
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,256
Sing the exact opposite

2366
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,352
Governor northam's calling cousin

2367
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
You want the demon eyes

2368
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,680
Now the only solution

2369
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:43,008
It's something we know is how it's a solution to every problem

2370
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
And that is him

2371
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,080
Well

2372
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,552
Exercise that rises to demystify

2373
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,696
Emergency crisis

2374
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,584
Materializing

2375
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:15,520
But you're word-of-mouth with a chain-reaction about Bandai video infowars.com forward slash show those wings fly

2376
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,592
Exponentially via text messaging word-of-mouth

2377
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,456
But outside of the censored YouTube and Twitter and all that good to everybody which is starting to happen

2378
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,784
We have a countervailing narrative of what really goes on

2379
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
All those folks

2380
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,976
Walmart

2381
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
Kyle Texas

2382
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:40,864
The cover-up

2383
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,656
This is important

2384
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,192
Alex does not give a

2385
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:49,312
About the El Paso shooter except to the extent that it helps him create propaganda

2386
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
He doesn't care about this guy's addictive

2387
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,640
He doesn't care about the

2388
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Handicar

2389
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,200
F*** man he doesn't even know his

2390
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,504
The point Alex

2391
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:00,832
Completely lying about what the Texas threat assessment says about Patra

2392
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Crusius

2393
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
41

2394
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:07,232
He's one of the examples listed in the section about white racially motivated terrorism

2395
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,280
Here's what the report says about him

2396
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Quote

2397
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,120
On August 3rd 2019 Patrick Wood crusius

2398
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:18,752
Allegedly opened fire in El Paso Texas Walmart killing 22 people and injuring 25 others

2399
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,896
Did the shooting croesus posted a Manifesto in a digital media platform in which he justified his actions

2400
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:27,968
As a response to the perceived ethnic replacement of whites

2401
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
By Hispanics

2402
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,528
And vote a voice support for the

2403
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Christ

2404
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,856
Church New Zealand shooter and his Manifesto

2405
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,440
Crusius is awaiting trial on state charges including capital murder

2406
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
Airport

2407
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
Also points out that there have been at least two International attack

2408
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,584
One on a synagogue in Germany

2409
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,144
Injured in Norway

2410
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,960
Where the shooters quote were inspired by his action

2411
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,752
Or demonstrated similar tack

2412
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,312
There's nothing in this report about an

2413
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,848
Antifa

2414
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
Nothing about any of

2415
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,176
Alex Jones is a bald-faced liar

2416
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:02,016
Pretending is This Racist Mass shooter wasn't motivated by the execs

2417
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,320
Same s*** you talked about on his show all the time

2418
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,368
I can't put it any simpler than this

2419
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,928
Alex Jones is an intellectual coward

2420
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,696
Top of the world

2421
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,464
Story

2422
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
Also the words

2423
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:14,560
Satan doesn't appear anywhere in the report nor does the word devil

2424
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
Nor does

2425
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,096
Occult

2426
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,888
The word Pagan shows up twice

2427
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,216
The only in the context of white supremacists adopting

2428
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
Pagan symbols

2429
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
The point here is that Alex has talked about some

2430
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
Something very serious

2431
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
And it relates to people being killed

2432
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,920
This is not a matter to take lightly

2433
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,224
Because 22 people died at that Walmart

2434
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,784
And countless lives were changed for the worse that day

2435
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,832
To take that event and lie about it just a

2436
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,624
Demonize your imaginary enemies in

2437
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,672
Further radicalize your listeners towards

2438
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:44,000
The conclusion that there's no such thing as white identity motivated terrorism

2439
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,536
That's the octopus monster

2440
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,328
And Alex doesn't not care

2441
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
He doesn't even care enough to

2442
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,936
Using read a report

2443
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:54,240
You just said he read it and makes it up about

2444
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,288
This is just disgusting

2445
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
The worst

2446
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,616
Yep

2447
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,688
The end of my comments

2448
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:09,856
He is a very violent guy in this world Alex's world revolves around

2449
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,136
But you said

2450
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
But it's important

2451
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,696
Right now

2452
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:16,512
You work hard in the Infowars

2453
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
Give links to ban.

2454
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
But

2455
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
Things are going to go bad

2456
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,936
Okay and he hasn't words

2457
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,960
Need to do when that out

2458
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:31,872
I believe you will dejected

2459
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,344
What

2460
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,160
So you get to decide who the globalist are you know

2461
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
Decide when things

2462
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,768
Kick-off definition

2463
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,352
You don't get to have boat

2464
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:55,424
I guess you don't need to be like let's cardioverted however

2465
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:59,264
Your criteria for starting it and

2466
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
All on your own

2467
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,336
Jesus enjoy

2468
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,384
So

2469
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,920
Galaxy gets back from break

2470
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,736
He starts talking about the Deep state is tried to

2471
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
Turn Trump

2472
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
I have some thoughts

2473
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,088
Okay

2474
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,160
They have the Deep state

2475
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:18,976
And the entire corporate media rights

2476
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:22,304
Thousands of articles

2477
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,072
Cyberspace

2478
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:27,168
To get Trump to come out against Infowars

2479
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,032
Tina believe that is the president ever came out against Infowars

2480
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,592
That would turn his face off against

2481
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,920
And that would turn me against the present

2482
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:43,552
I don't think anyone is Ever Wanted Trump to denounce Infowars because they want to alienate him from his face

2483
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:50,464
I think it's generally more benefiting where it's completely unacceptable for the president of a country to think Alex Jones is anything other than a liar

2484
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,816
The case of Erica Lafferty who's mother with

2485
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,608
The principal of Sandy Hook Elementary

2486
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,680
She's very offended when Trump was elected that he been on

2487
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,448
With Alex

2488
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:04,032
Not the same person who'd said on-air that her mother wasn't really killed

2489
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:06,848
MP clear her mother died trying to save the

2490
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
That's cool

2491
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:10,688
Called her as well as Erica

2492
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
Working for the global

2493
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,992
Strength Jake is gone

2494
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,832
You can kind of understand why she might be interested in the president of the country distance

2495
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,624
Himself from someone like that

2496
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:22,976
And then you just had your garden-variety reasons to want Trump away from Infowars

2497
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:26,048
Namely that the information that Alex puts out he's bad

2498
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,840
It's usually factually come

2499
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:28,608
Wheatley wrong

2500
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,656
And almost always has a kernel of Lights

2501
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
Supremacy buried in it

2502
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,984
It's just unacceptable for the head of state

2503
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776
Talk to someone deserving

2504
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,336
Anything other than condemnation

2505
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,616
You don't need a deep state

2506
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,664
Motivate people to arrive at that

2507
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,480
Conclusion

2508
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,016
Policy director is

2509
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,808
A white supremacist who does all the

2510
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,344
Right who Alex loves

2511
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
So

2512
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,160
That's all

2513
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,184
It's all stupid

2514
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,720
But now let's enjoy

2515
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,536
Does Alex starts talking more about how no one wants in a

2516
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:04,192
Stuff that's what I'm looking for severe burn

2517
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,216
I want his failure

2518
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:09,568
We just called up some of the pro-gun groups in Virginia today won't you come on the show

2519
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:15,968
We don't want to be associated with that

2520
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
Weird narrate president-elect

2521
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,320
Associated with the First Amendment

2522
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,624
Not even getting the instinct

2523
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,672
Who cares what the media says about you

2524
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,000
What we are

2525
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
Need to be

2526
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:32,352
Love by the couple of organizers of a rally

2527
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,400
Shut up there

2528
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,824
If you that has the power of what your message is

2529
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,848
How you let them

2530
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,456
Amateur nature

2531
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:51,808
Have a lot of political activist and they look at somebody's been very very successful

2532
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:54,368
With our audience America

2533
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:58,464
Always being led by a bunch of political novices

2534
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:03,840
It might not be political novices and they must also not be worried about bad press they might

2535
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
I hate you

2536
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
Little bit of reverse

2537
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,192
Little bit of a little bit of shade on there just like

2538
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:11,520
Hey if you don't want to come on my show is cuz you are

The podium was ever spoken on a Podium before and had things happen for them Alex

2541
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
So mad

2542
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,160
The Democrats

2543
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:33,536
Civil War

2544
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,424
Get there at

2545
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,192
Together

2546
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,008
Meanwhile the main groups that have financed Trump

2547
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,056
The biggest fundraisers for him

2548
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:51,456
For six months of a trying to get me to go on event

2549
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:04,768
A bunch of them Politico what a joke

2550
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:11,168
Armored vehicle

2551
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,472
Your phone

2552
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,008
Man he's got such

2553
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,544
Andromache

2554
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,080
Pathetic

2555
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
Child

2556
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,896
Do you know what I didn't even want to look

2557
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,456
Bigger people want me then you so I did

2558
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:33,952
And it doesn't bother me at all

2559
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,000
I don't even care if you

2560
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:40,352
I suspect during that break but he just went out to

2561
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:44,704
Someone maybe Rob do came over and was like hey Alex that was a bad look

2562
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,008
You look like an a******

2563
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,288
Bad. So you say

2564
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:57,248
Go back live ladies and gentlemen I want to just say one more thing about what I talked about last second

2565
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,064
About me

2566
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,856
You understand

2567
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:02,880
Yeah I understand

2568
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:10,048
Sure about it about me otherwise yelling about how your amateurs are not wanted to hang out with me and, by jove

2569
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:16,448
And I'll be there in no one looks at you cuz I'm the Great

2570
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,984
Created this movement

2571
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
But I created this movement

2572
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:24,384
Single-handedly imaveriq

2573
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,664
This is not

2574
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
About

2575
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:31,296
Absolutely anything from my history

2576
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,832
Alex Jones in history

2577
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:39,488
I don't make it about me notably humble always always always

2578
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:45,888
Is Right 100% of the time if I wanted to brag I could because I would brag about how right I am 300%

2579
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,472
So Alex ends this episode are on the 50

2580
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,800
Where do we see in a bit of

2581
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,824
In the reefs

2582
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
Recent days

2583
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,128
And it's getting it

2584
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
Descending in

2585
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,944
Locked up

2586
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,992
Space about killing global

2587
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,856
We're starting to get to a point that as a citizen who sworn an oath publicly

2588
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,184
Defend my family your family in our honor

2589
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,464
That

2590
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:14,560
We need to be very peaceful and very focused and very active right now

2591
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,448
And then we'd have to understand that we don't bust our ass

2592
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,752
Face and Emily

2593
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,288
Watching them

2594
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,824
That job

2595
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:30,432
Pichai calms the bubbles know they can sit this out there

2596
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
Again

2597
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:34,528
They are intended to start

2598
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,304
And if the president would have arrested some of the deep state

2599
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,072
Dotty's

2600
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,400
What the chips fall where they may

2601
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,728
They try to bring out some dirt on some of the Trump people

2602
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,008
Nobody's going to care

2603
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,544
As long as he American

2604
01:55:57,056 --> 01:56:02,944
Supporting

2605
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
Enough talk

2606
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,528
Sand

2607
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,368
It's my pay grade is he what we should do about the president knows

2608
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,672
Walmart

2609
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,744
We're not in normal situation

2610
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:20,608
The Democrats are a bunch of insane methods

2611
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:24,960
Are minions

2612
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,104
They're not insulated

2613
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,152
I need to know they're not insulated

2614
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:40,064
So the only reason I I highlighted it does seem like towards

2615
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,416
At the end of his shows lately this these sorts of conversations are becoming

2616
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
Armoire

2617
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
Normal

2618
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,488
Okay

2619
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,768
I'm going to throw this out

2620
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,792
What if

2621
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,864
Instead of Democrats being insane meth head

2622
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:56,704
Just people like you and I just disagree

2623
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,752
What antifa

2624
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
Incel

2625
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,592
Neil dick they can't just be people who disagree

2626
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,872
Antifa

2627
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:14,112
You know what actually you convinced me with a simple chant

2628
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:27,936
I understand now just getting into this

2629
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:31,264
16th and I can understand some people having a sense of like

2630
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:35,104
I just going to be a slog you know I promise

2631
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,152
If you stick it out

2632
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,944
By the end of this episode

2633
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,712
You will get

2634
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,736
Here Alex Jones

2635
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,016
Try to interview a baby

2636
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,064
Okay

2637
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,208
I'm not saying that we do things regularly

2638
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:55,328
But so far I would have opened the show with that cuz I'll be willing to go through a lot more of that early

2639
01:57:55,584 --> 01:58:01,728
Tough with a better attitude I regret to tell people literally about the 16th

2640
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,752
Interview

2641
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,128
Now but he starts

2642
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,944
16th by just stressing and reinforce

2643
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,016
Sing that the globalist are going to false-flag the rally in Richmond

2644
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,808
That used to run false Flags

2645
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,088
When they had

2646
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,392
The presidency

2647
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,232
Delta Force

2648
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:28,608
Bombing of a federal building

2649
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:32,192
Stage

2650
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,984
99 events

2651
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,008
In

2652
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
Washington State

2653
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,872
Seattle

2654
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,456
I don't have the military they don't have

2655
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,504
Those units that can carry out

2656
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,296
False flags on presents or anymore

2657
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:51,648
And by the way when Clinton ordered all that stuff it was the beginning of the end of the deep state

2658
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:57,792
But if they're going to have their metal Foundation

2659
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
Birds out there

2660
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:02,912
Trying to pull some all trying to trick people into a mass shooting

2661
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:09,824
They got milia windup toys drugged-up probably in comas right now they're going to turn back on if I roll out in d.c.

2662
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,592
And

2663
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,152
In Virginia

2664
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,760
But everybody's got to be on maximum alert right now

2665
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,040
In the next few weeks

2666
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,088
So I mean this is just

2667
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,648
Spaghetti at the wall kind of s***

2668
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:26,208
But it all just isn't service loan

2669
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,488
Tank why not

2670
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,816
Oh they're all in comas that they're going to run on ice

2671
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:35,424
It is all just still in service of the exact same thing which is preemptive Justice

2672
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,752
Applications for a theories violence it appears to be origin

2673
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:43,104
Originating in the right-wing Spears it wasn't real at all fake

2674
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,712
It's and it's sloppy Foundation people now cuz I don't have Delta Force

2675
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,064
Alex we can't be associated with you because you

2676
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,624
Screamed about false-flag Amateur hour

2677
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:58,464
I understand why you disagree with us however

2678
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,584
You are screaming about false Flags right now as well so you see why we're headed

2679
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,376
Attempt to join with you

2680
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:07,424
On account of your ability to learn lesson

2681
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,776
So Alex says something really into

2682
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,824
Christine at the beginning of this episode

2683
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,104
That has nothing to do with

2684
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
Senior anything like

2685
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,152
I love

2686
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:17,920
Freebird

2687
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:22,272
Skynyrd is going to come up later

2688
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,576
Right now that's not that's okay

2689
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,112
Is really fast

2690
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,416
Watching their every move

2691
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,464
And the police are there watching

2692
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:39,936
Before I had deeper understanding

2693
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,288
America is

2694
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,336
For good and for evil we are both here because

2695
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,104
Cuz we are

2696
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,664
Destined to decide the destiny of the planet

2697
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,968
We haven't voted bad coming together in the

2698
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,784
So I think that's really interesting

2699
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,648
I think it's a surface-level where that statement is f***** up but there's another level it's even more trouble

2700
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:05,024
Insane on the surface this is Alex saying that America is more important than any other country in the world

2701
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,584
We decide the destiny of the planet which is just stupid

2702
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:12,448
If you would have asked some blowhard subject of the crown during any of the Fallen Empires and

2703
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,728
In the course of human history

2704
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,008
The exact same thing

2705
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:18,848
It's a myopic view things in more over it's just childish

2706
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,896
Kipling wrote a white man

2707
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,200
I think we got

2708
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:30,880
Buried in the statement seems to be that America is the only country where both good and evil exist

2709
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:33,952
The implication being that you literally said quote

2710
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,488
America is where the battle is fought

2711
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:39,328
For good and evil we have both here because we're destined to decide the destiny of the

2712
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,096
The planet

2713
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:45,728
If we're destined to decide the destiny of the planet that's not something that can really be true of more than one

2714
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,264
That's a unique cat

2715
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,288
Tribute of America

2716
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,568
According to this line of thinking

2717
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:50,848
That's so destiny

2718
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:51,616
Nice work

2719
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:54,176
The structure of the Alexs state

2720
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
Is saying that

2721
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:58,272
Yeah because we are the country with this unique attribute

2722
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,552
There's both Good and Evil

2723
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,856
Which heavily implies it in his mind

2724
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:05,184
Other countries are either solely good or solely evil

2725
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,488
I don't think Alex consciously

2726
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,280
But I definitely think it's

2727
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,816
Subconscious believe he holds

2728
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:11,840
And guess what

2729
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:17,728
Easy to guess which countries are good which are evil I don't understand what would be the difference between

2730
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,776
If you're majority like a very short

2731
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:24,640
Visual thing just give me one quick thing so I don't have to think about it

2732
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,688
What do you think the difference is between mouth

2733
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:33,088
If your majority Muslim or not but there's one way you can convert your country

2734
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,112
The overage being good

2735
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,648
It turns out and that's

2736
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,464
If you have a ruler who's friends with

2737
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,792
Override

2738
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:44,608
Clear geopolitical bias towards hating on white countries

2739
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:47,168
So it turns out and I didn't know this

2740
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,192
But it turns out that

2741
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,472
God has

2742
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,752
Created the United

2743
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
Midstates

2744
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:54,592
As a Hunger Games type Battleground

2745
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,616
To see what

2746
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,640
Whether good or

2747
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,920
Evil wins in the end

2748
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:04,320
If your Brazil's Trump Alex is cool with you

2749
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,624
Absolutely

2750
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,696
So I think Alex has red

2751
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,464
About these

2752
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,256
Yeah base

2753
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,792
I think he has

2754
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,072
That's because he's aren't real

2755
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:18,912
The news broke before like an hour and a half before the show started, 6

2756
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,448
I think

2757
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,240
That he knows about the

2758
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
But he doesn't

2759
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
Bring it up

2760
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,592
Todd County right now

2761
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:30,944
There's no doubt

2762
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:37,088
I'm telling you it's so damn perfect

2763
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:41,184
Everybody's like well why this impeachments a joke they're not going to connect him instead

2764
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,232
They need that symbol

2765
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:46,560
What day is in Traeger next week

2766
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:53,472
Churches getting shot up

2767
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,776
You'll think it's in

2768
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
Virginia

2769
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,592
When it's going to be in

2770
02:03:59,104 --> 02:03:59,872
California

2771
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,408
Texas Michigan

2772
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
Illinois

2773
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,480
Mississippi

2774
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:07,040
I think Alex knows that

2775
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,576
Based on

2776
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:09,856
What

2777
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,648
The reporting is on

2778
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,672
Did the group

2779
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,488
That there's a possibility that there are

2780
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:18,048
Other trios of people in other places

2781
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
Is there other small group

2782
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:23,680
Attacking a black church or a gay bar

2783
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:25,472
Things that are in line with

2784
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,752
What sort of

2785
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:32,128
Neo-Nazi escort these groups

2786
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,408
Have to achieve

2787
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:38,272
The way Alex is presenting this makes me think that it's in line with him knowing about it

2788
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,808
But he won't say

2789
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,856
He won't talk about that story

2790
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:42,624
And he doesn't

2791
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,160
At all

2792
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,696
No like the whole show

2793
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,488
That seems like a

2794
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,512
Big story

2795
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,304
Is that a lot of people would cover

2796
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,120
Because the information there is that

2797
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,400
There are

2798
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,704
Maybe a lot

2799
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,984
Of

2800
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,544
Cells of terrorist cells at 3

2801
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,336
Also that

2802
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,640
Remind takes

2803
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:06,944
And you could be in over

2804
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:09,248
For sure for sure the point being

2805
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
It's a big store

2806
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,856
Yes it's a big story and if I was a news organization

2807
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,624
I would probably

2808
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:17,184
Well Alex's other

2809
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,976
Talk about being cut off from God

2810
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:21,280
Call dispatch

2811
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:22,816
I forgot

2812
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:25,632
Thought about God hates Tim Cook story

2813
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,960
That's a big one cook when he goes to hell which is just a

2814
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,240
Dementia

2815
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,544
Subway

2816
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:38,432
He's going to be in a jail cell for eternity with himself a jail cell

2817
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:46,368
Is Bernie hatred for Humanity that he created

2818
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,136
God

2819
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
Create hell

2820
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:51,232
One thing God didn't create

2821
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:56,096
That question is

2822
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:58,144
Eclipse stupid and has nothing to do with anything

2823
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:03,776
But as I was listening to this episode I looked at the time on it and I realize that I had cut an eclipse in awhile

2824
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,568
So I figured I'd just give you a little Tay

2825
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
Taste of how the first half

2826
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,152
Half hour of the show isn't a stupid everything is

2827
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:12,992
Alex is preaching real hard but it's a real standard boring

2828
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:19,648
I think it's all the b******* about our ancestors wanting us to go to the stars and how Alex it doesn't love his fancy cars

2829
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,928
God that's important

2830
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,720
Of course he's in a deep hole

2831
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,488
And legitimate

2832
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,560
Really the only thing close to real I've heard him touch on his him making

2833
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,584
Can clear in that

2834
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,864
Quick we just played

2835
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,656
Caltrop

2836
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:33,728
I think that it's clear these aware of those Nazi arrest

2837
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,544
It won't directly cover the story

2838
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,080
It's my sense that he's

2839
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,872
You know he's building up

2840
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,408
Tomatoes arrest

2841
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,944
Part of his false flag narrative

2842
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:45,760
Now that the globalist putting out stories about these rest

2843
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:49,856
It's probably aren't real fish in the country for a rash of fascist

2844
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,880
Racist violence

2845
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:54,976
Just secretly just being carried out by antifa until needle dicks or whatever

2846
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,512
Shameful

2847
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,536
And it's really boring

2848
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,072
Honestly it's

2849
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,400
If you're looking

2850
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,192
For a demented televangelist

2851
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,728
It's kind of services

2852
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,032
In the sense that at least he's clearly an idiot

2853
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:10,336
And he's calling out real people like Tim Cook

2854
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,616
Which is kind of fun

2855
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:13,408
What is a half hour stretch of a show that's

2856
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:15,456
Pretending to be a real serious new show

2857
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,224
I find it at

2858
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:16,992
Exhausting

2859
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:21,600
Especially considering that he's mostly doing this to ramp up to running interference

2860
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,624
Literal neo-Nazi

2861
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,392
Peter sells

2862
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,672
And seemingly

2863
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,696
On the table

2864
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,720
To talk

2865
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:30,816
Yeah it it does seem like rather than deal with

2866
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,632
Neo-Nazi Terror cell

2867
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,680
He's rewriting a Chris

2868
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,448
Miss Carol

2869
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:38,496
And Tim Cook is going to

2870
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:42,080
Forge the chains in life that he will wear in death

2871
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
Also Tim Cook

2872
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,640
He's creating his own

2873
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,664
Prison

2874
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:51,808
Ergonomic

2875
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:03,328
The god ask people that are consciously evil and do bad guys don't destroy him

2876
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:05,632
But people that know what's going on

2877
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,680
Connection to God

2878
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,008
That's like nerve endings that the God and God

2879
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,288
He's just like

2880
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:15,616
What you know this is wrong you don't like

2881
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,896
Children

2882
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:20,480
You don't like drinking their blood will they back for Mommy

2883
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:26,880
Like inventing new Eagles but you don't do anything I am on a really turn you over yourself you.

2884
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:27,648
Damn coward

2885
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:34,304
I have no idea what Alex is saying is some reference to a Bible verse I can't remember half and he's misrepresent

2886
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:40,448
He's making God into really a human figure this is s*** that you

2887
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:47,104
I'm not saying that he should be forcibly institutional

2888
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,640
But this is the type of ship

2889
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,432
Did somebody who is institutionalized

2890
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:55,808
It's been a long time since I've read the Bible

2891
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,648
On whether or not God has a grudging respect for people who are willfully evil

2892
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,184
Terminal leave that aside

2893
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,232
But I do think it might be worth

2894
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:05,280
Pointing out that on many occasions

2895
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:08,864
Alex's talked about having a grudging respect for people like David Rockefeller

2896
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
Who are the heads of

2897
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,656
Evil globalist

2898
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,936
Where is he just hates

2899
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:14,752
The followers are no better in sign up with evil anyway

2900
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,800
Basically what I'm saying is this

2901
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,568
This is trying to

2902
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:22,176
Personify God it seems like a lot of his own personality gets wrapped up in the presentation

2903
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:26,528
It is where I did notice that God had a very kind of like

2904
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:32,928
He kind of has a cowboy nature2 I didn't realize that God wondered from

2905
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,952
Town to town

2906
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,744
With a grudging respect

2907
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,584
For the black hat they're only actual

2908
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,120
Somebody called this blasphemy

2909
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:45,728
But I was just call it a very predictable manifestation of his rampant nurses

2910
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,056
So Alex Starks

2911
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:52,128
You brambles by garden and that's understood for a long

2912
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,944
Stretch any finally talks about

2913
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,760
Close to real at least

2914
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:00,576
And that is that the governor Northam had to Prescott

2915
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,112
So

2916
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:06,208
Hh8 he reminded you know when it's like when people talk about

2917
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:09,792
They're describing their pets

2918
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:14,144
Baby dog loves tacos

2919
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:19,776
Yeah and it's fun because you're friends with your dog

2920
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:25,920
A little bit about this Northam press conference but he doesn't talk about anything

2921
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:28,736
Specific he never gets to covering it

2922
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:30,272
And

2923
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:31,808
I would say he faked

2924
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:32,832
Scrying

2925
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,280
It's enough

2926
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,304
Transcript

2927
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,656
Exact script

2928
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:48,448
Following the exact

2929
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,776
We already saw them pre-programming

2930
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:59,200
We got to just sit here and wait for them to come at a bash and blame it on it

2931
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:02,528
Play me

2932
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,552
Play music

2933
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,600
Arigato

2934
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,488
We know they're doing it and we can

2935
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,888
Take a class

2936
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,472
Guy is such memory

2937
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:22,752
Perfect

2938
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:23,520
Perfect

2939
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,736
I have seen a High School production

2940
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:34,784
F******

2941
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:39,904
What's the name of it the Scottish play

2942
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:46,816
I was going to kill me

2943
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:53,472
So we get back to this idea if you touch down earlier and that was at the Revolutionary War started in Virginia

2944
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,008
Expand

2945
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
Here

2946
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,056
Clip

2947
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,360
This is weird

2948
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:03,968
While the Senate trial the present start Tuesday will be there while covering up the devil

2949
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,624
All of that is going on

2950
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:14,464
Just south of their Virginia

2951
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,744
For the Revolutionary War

2952
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,560
Nope still didn't care Boston

2953
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:21,376
Boston isn't in Virginia

2954
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,704
Where the Civil War start

2955
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,496
The Deep state

2956
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:27,264
Is it

2957
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,080
Guilt-free repeat it

2958
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,128
History repeats

2959
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:35,968
Repeat that

2960
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,040
Batting

2961
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,576
Table everything

2962
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:43,136
Virginia and Charlottesville Square

2963
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,416
So

2964
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,976
Got You Under stand correctly the globalist

2965
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,256
Don't have

2966
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,280
Because of course

2967
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Of course

2968
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:53,120
A side effect of this isn't there obsessed with history repeating

2969
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:59,520
They need to be that such of the banking everything they have on this rally on Monday in Virginia which I was calling Charlottesville Square

2970
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:05,920
The only thing that makes sense because they want to kick off another civil war and that's where the old Civil War started the Revolutionary War

2971
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:06,688
True thing

2972
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,480
Again the Revolutionary War started

2973
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,832
Despite Alex's claimed is not the same place as Virginia

2974
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:16,160
There wasn't even a battle in Virginia until the Battle of Great Bridge

2975
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,952
Which was December 9th 90

2976
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:18,976
17 seven

2977
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,512
25 for 8 months

2978
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:24,864
Concord at the spiritual beginning

2979
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,936
It seems like Alex is actually the one obsessed with

2980
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:31,008
Pretending history repeats when he's got history wrong

2981
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:33,568
He's also completely wrong about the Civil War

2982
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:36,384
Call Mainline historians recognize the beginning

2983
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,968
Of the Civil War began when the Confederate Army open fire on Fort Sumter

2984
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:40,992
Which is not virtue

2985
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:43,296
But is actually in South Carolina

2986
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,064
I mean there's that

2987
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,344
That was an April 8th

2988
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:47,136
1061 and it wasn't

2989
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:50,720
Until month later that there were some smaller battles some off the coast of

2990
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:52,256
The Virginian but those were

2991
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:55,328
Nor were they pivotal moments in the Civil War

2992
02:13:56,096 --> 02:14:00,448
If I had to guess Alex might be thinking that the Civil War started in Virginia because that was where the

2993
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:03,264
The first biggest land battle the battle of Bull Run 2

2994
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:06,592
But that wasn't until July 1861

2995
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,640
3 months into open hostilities

2996
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:09,920
This was a big

2997
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,944
Confederate victory

2998
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,224
So maybe he thinks

2999
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,528
That's where it all started but that doesn't really make sense

3000
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:17,600
Fort Sumter that attack was an absolute Confederate Victor

3001
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:20,928
I'm getting out of the Alex's view history is incoherent

3002
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:26,560
And he's just trying to Bluff his way around pretending the to all the big Wars in US history started in Virginia

3003
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:27,584
To lend credence

3004
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,352
Who is b*******

3005
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,376
About the globalist want

3006
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:30,912
I can take off a civil war on Monday

3007
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,032
This is really sad hard for history to repeat itself when it didn't happen in

3008
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:36,800
In the first place

3009
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:39,104
That would be a difficult thing for

3010
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,664
Like why would the globalist want history to

3011
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,432
Repeat itself

3012
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:46,272
Inaccurate historical

3013
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,296
I don't know

3014
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,832
Patriot lure

3015
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,416
Burn up Laura is a good way to

3016
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,440
Headway valet

3017
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,976
Timey wimey

3018
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:57,024
So instead of talking about

3019
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,048
Governor Northam

3020
02:14:58,304 --> 02:14:58,816
Press conference

3021
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:03,168
And instead of touching on this story about these Neo-Nazi arrest

3022
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:03,936
At all

3023
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:07,520
Alex just starts rambling about Governor Northam

3024
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:09,568
And talk about how he wants to kill her

3025
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:10,848
The governor

3026
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,384
Is running around

3027
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,248
Peckerwood

3028
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,976
Pathetic he is evil here

3029
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:33,632
Can organs

3030
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:36,192
It is

3031
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:38,752
Tell you weren't invited

3032
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:40,800
Tell me you're bad

3033
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,128
You need to get here

3034
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:47,456
I got it all set up or he's the victim channel for kids

3035
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,224
The Killing

3036
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,528
With that guy so we got to shift

3037
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,808
And watching

3038
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,368
Salivate and literally get an erection

3039
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,648
While he's talking about boot

3040
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:06,400
The man is an Abomination but here's the thing

3041
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:08,192
They'll make it attempt on his life

3042
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:11,776
I wanted a little long time to prison cell I wish no harm upon

3043
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,824
Gavin Newsom

3044
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:17,920
What is this is a new wrinkle that he got an erection

3045
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:21,760
Action while talking about babies in abortion

3046
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:25,344
I was right now I'm just wondering if Peckerwood A step above

3047
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,112
Music

3048
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,392
It's hard to say

3049
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:29,440
It's hard to say there's no clear hierarchy

3050
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:34,560
I remember the Bible verse though remove the

3051
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:39,168
Wood from your pecker before trying to remove the needle from somebody else's dick

3052
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,960
Slipping problem remember that way

3053
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,288
I mean look dude this is all just Alex being like

3054
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:46,848
Everything in my being wants to kill him but

3055
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,152
Society

3056
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,176
Okay

3057
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:52,992
Micelles

3058
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,016
My heart that it's right

3059
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:57,600
To murder this bad up until now has done

3060
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:01,184
Nothing to me in a negative fashion whatsoever

3061
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,464
But societies like

3062
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:05,024
Don't murder people who haven't bothered you

3063
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:08,608
This just ends up with Alex rambling

3064
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:10,144
About Northam

3065
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:13,472
And then he gets into Michelle wolf

3066
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:16,800
Complaining about her

3067
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:19,616
This is

3068
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,640

F****** exhausted incoherent

3070
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:29,344

3072
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:34,976

3105
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
Okay

3106
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,456

God sounds a lot like a middle-aged

3123
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:19,584
Texan man with

3124
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,352

02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,448
Sounds like Alex projector

3127
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,216
Little bit

3128
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:29,056
A little bit of a longer clip cuz I wanted you to

3129
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:29,824
Feel it

3130
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,872
Episode

3131
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:40,320
Father why have you forsaken me

3132
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:41,088
Jesus

3133
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:44,672
Anyway we'll see you in a little bit I hate to plug

3134
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:48,768
Nobody hate plug-in more than me

3135
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,816
Nobody dislikes plug-in more than

3136
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:53,376
So glad I told you that to Skynyrd

3137
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:55,936
Going to come up and I here's the clip where that comes

3138
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:57,728
Keisha Scott

3139
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,056
Alex's describing

3140
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:03,104
Alex's describing what God told

3141
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,016
You got to take action

3142
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:13,344
Control

3143
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,648
Godson

3144
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:17,952
Cuz that's all God wants

3145
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:19,488
The song from

3146
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:26,400
Direct line to God.

3147
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:27,936
First of all what the f***

3148
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,984
Kind of Southerner does Alex think he is

3149
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,032
He can't remember the name of Simple Man

3150
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,080
I reckon that where I come from

3151
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:34,848
That's a brick

3152
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:36,896
You show up at

3153
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:38,688
Karaoke bars I used to frequent

3154
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:43,296
Forget the name of the Skynyrd song you're going to get a bottle of Pace Picante sauce thrown out

3155
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:45,344
New York City

3156
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:51,744
Episode and Alex just cannot get himself to cover the story

3157
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:56,352
He's vaguely reference Governor Northam giving a press conference

3158
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,680
Literally been talkin about nothing friend

3159
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:02,240
Our Behavior press conference about nothing

3160
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:06,336
Outside of a couple of supremely weird things he says this whole episode has just been

3161
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,616
Treading water

3162
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:11,968
And it doesn't sound like he comes back into the second hour and what do you know

3163
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:16,576
Still talking about the car dealership

3164
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,624
Like that you'd use hydrogen

3165
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,976
UPS latest photo

3166
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:30,656
HBO teams with CNN's Brian stelter for documentary about the rise of fake news

3167
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:31,936
Going to be starring in that

3168
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,240
Carlton

3169
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:36,544
Probably going to get a mansion

3170
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,312
He's going to get

3171
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:43,968
Laughing about how fast can stop talking about

3172
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:49,344
So he does a long segment on Brian stelter

3173
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:51,136
Of course Angela

3174
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,416
Weirdly

3175
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,184
Esoteric

3176
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,208
In the middle of this

3177
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:58,816
Complained about Brian stelter physical appearance

3178
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:03,424
Amazon Lala looking shelter because I want to know what the devil look like

3179
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,056
Army that's what generals look like

3180
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,872
Slaves

3181
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:16,992
Why does Batman

3182
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,272
Tone-deaf

3183
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,576
I need my telephone

3184
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,208
He doesn't have anything he is literally

3185
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,256
Other universe

3186
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:31,072
He is the scum of the earth is

3187
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:36,192
Absolutely destroyed solid piece of trash

3188
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,216
Hold on a second

3189
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:43,616
It might down for the rest of this club because Alex is going to I really don't know what he's talking about and I do need your help to park

3190
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:46,176
I don't say that to me

3191
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:49,760
Get away from it

3192
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:59,744
Because the next level here in the find out what's really going on

3193
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,792
And I'm telling you it's already erase

3194
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:02,816
Almost

3195
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:03,584
Detonated

3196
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
Is it a weapon

3197
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,912
God is good

3198
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:13,824
Because we think I'm God is invincible and omnipresent and God is he we believe in God and stand up

3199
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:14,592
Let me tell

3200
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:15,872
The bomb

3201
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,712
The bomb doesn't

3202
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:23,040
I think it just destroys it carries out this

3203
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:23,808
Fraction of children

3204
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:24,576
.

3205
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,856
If its primary mission

3206
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,648
All it does is kill live

3207
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:29,952
And I see children

3208
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:31,488
The potential the future

3209
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:36,864
That's why they're powerful

3210
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:37,888
Because it's broke

3211
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:38,912
It's not a soul

3212
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:40,704
I don't I get it

3213
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:46,592
I get it all you're looking get it all I'm very I decide totally got moving can I ask

3214
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:52,992
If do you understand this because there's a piece of SyFy that you've read that I have

3215
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,016
So you are familiar with

3216
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:54,784
Okay

3217
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:55,552
This

3218
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:57,856
Is Peter Pan than this is

3219
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,136
Exactly Peter Pan

3220
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:03,744
God is a strong if we all believe in him out

3221
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,840
God is Tinkerbell is killing all of the children that's the f******

3222
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:09,888
Crocodile

3223
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,424
It's all it all makes sense

3224
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,008
He is completely confusing the plot to Peter Pan

3225
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
I think

3226
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:19,616
Got I think there's a possibility that you're right and made the Tinkerbell part of it

3227
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:25,760
Is very if you believe it

3228
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:28,064
Okay that's weird that's

3229
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,832
Tinkerbell

3230
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:30,368
Idea what he saying

3231
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:31,648
The end that like

3232
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:32,416
The

3233
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:34,464
Like the demons are at

3234
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,512
Computer program.

3235
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:39,840
I mean I don't agree with him but I can't

3236
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:41,632
I get what you're saying

3237
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,936
I understand conceptually

3238
02:25:44,448 --> 02:25:45,984
And I think the other stuff

3239
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,776
About like there's a bomb

3240
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:48,800
It's been detonated

3241
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,848
There's a bomb in the crocodile

3242
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,128
True

3243
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:59,296
I'm convinced I mean to express it like there is a timeline or there's a dead

3244
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:01,088
There's a deadline we've got to get off

3245
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,368
Planet by

3246
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,136
The demon

3247
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:05,696
Program has already been

3248
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:09,792
So we're running away from the bombs

3249
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:11,584
Detritus right because

3250
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,120
Brian stelter looks

3251
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:16,960
Yes that is correct that is that is what started it

3252
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:17,728
DLR right

3253
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:24,384
God began a half-hour into the second hour to snow now and you will not talk about anything

3254
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,664
Means anything man

3255
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,200
Dude I will say

3256
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:31,552
He did give a long retelling of the story of The Prodigal Son

3257
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:37,696
It seemed like she was kind of close to the actual story but I'm not positive the metaphor

3258
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:40,000
So it was way too long

3259
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:40,768
Take me to Cotton Club

3260
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:43,072
For it but everyone should know

3261
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,352
You getting closer

3262
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:48,448
Children's bible stories

3263
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:52,288
Still waiting for him

3264
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:53,824
To give a critical breakdown

3265
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:54,848
Don Quixote

3266
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,920
Right on every single.

3267
02:26:58,432 --> 02:27:00,224
Those windmills

3268
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,784
Those are the ones causing all the problems

3269
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,552
Jesus

3270
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:09,952
Protect us from windmill that's why the Jews put them on a windmill and spun around everybody knows

3271
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:18,656
I was working

3272
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:19,424
Pretty late

3273
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:22,496
Getting all the all the stuff ready

3274
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,520
Episode

3275
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,056
At 2 in the morning

3276
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:28,896
Maybe 1 or so but whatever the case

3277
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:33,504
I lost my mind I would have been flagging long before

3278
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:35,040
I'm amazed you made it this far

3279
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:37,344
I quit made me lose my mind

3280
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,112
Laughing

3281
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,392
Dinos

3282
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:41,184
It's not bragging

3283
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:45,536
Infowars people

3284
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:46,816
You're the best

3285
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,120
You love God

3286
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,144
We're not

3287
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:52,704
We said it wouldn't recognize that

3288
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:54,240
The elect

3289
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:57,056
God love Justice and freedom are hypocrite

3290
02:27:57,312 --> 02:27:58,080
Start face

3291
02:27:58,848 --> 02:27:59,616
What's another show

3292
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,688
That just made me lose my s***

3293
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,480
God's elect

3294
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:05,248
Alack

3295
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,064
No no this isn't

3296
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:11,392
We're just God's chosen people just so happen

3297
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:17,792
All the good people in the universe are the people believe my outrageous bulshit

3298
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:20,864
What's even crazier is that all the good people in the universe

3299
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,888
Love me

3300
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:23,680
Love me specifically

3301
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:24,448
Perhaps

3302
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,984
Maybe the only thing that

3303
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,288
Actually unites all of these good people

3304
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,336
Is there love for me

3305
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:32,128
And I'm not saying no

3306
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:32,896
I'm not boast

3307
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,688
So at this point Alex

3308
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:37,760
Finally gets to the neo-Nazi

3309
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:39,296
I'm lying

3310
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:40,576
He doesn't

3311
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,584
Football games

3312
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:57,984
Talking about

3313
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:59,008
Get on your knees

3314
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:02,336
And decide you want to be a Brian stelter

3315
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:07,968
I got up this morning I saw this infowars.com article that I wouldn't saw this.

3316
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:12,832
Dental assistant

3317
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:21,536
Animal training

3318
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:23,584
Dental assistant fired

3319
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,632
Expressing support

3320
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:27,936
Pro Trump on Facebook

3321
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:32,288
So Alex is gearing up here to interview is conservative victim of the week

3322
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:38,688
Yeah this time it's a Milwaukee woman named Robin Pollock who claims choose fired from a dental assistant job because you posted

3323
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:40,480
Make America great again on Facebook

3324
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:44,064
Unfortunately this doesn't really seem to be totally true

3325
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:49,440
Apparently someone left a bad review on her employers Facebook page

3326
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:52,768
Claiming that her social media was offensive and racist

3327
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:56,352
And that might have a lead to determination but it doesn't seem like

3328
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:58,912
Supporting Trump was the offensive or racist

3329
02:29:59,168 --> 02:29:59,680
Nothing

3330
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:05,568
CBS 58 out of Milwaukee fountain for Facebook post where she had posted things like

3331
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:08,128
Suggesting that President Obama was the leader of Isis

3332
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,408
All right well that one

3333
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:14,784
That one's trouble it's possible that someone saw that post founded offenses racist to eat hunted made the

3334
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,808
Complain to her employer

3335
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:21,440
I have no idea what the reality is here because she says that she was fired for supporting Trump which is

3336
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,976
Exactly what she should do

3337
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:24,000
In the circumstance

3338
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:24,768
So she finds herself

3339
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:26,816
Victimhood narratives are like

3340
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:27,584
Catnip

3341
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:30,144
Conservative media so she's going to get a lot of play out

3342
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:33,984
And plenty of opportunities to promote let's say a GoFundMe

3343
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:35,776
Like the one she's already launched

3344
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:36,544
Called quotes

3345
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,592
Wrongfully fired for saying Maga

3346
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:39,872
Good for her

3347
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,664
Her employer says grift

3348
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:48,064
Employer says they didn't fire her for supporting Trump and the labor attorney that CBS spoke to even if they

3349
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,344
Did that wouldn't be illegal

3350
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:51,392
Political opinions are not protected

3351
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:52,672
From an employment

3352
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
Perspective

3353
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:55,744
Alex tells her to Sue or former employee

3354
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,536
And that she is a slam-dunk case

3355
02:30:57,792 --> 02:31:01,120
But I sincerely hope that used to paying attention to Alex's legal situation

3356
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,168
Knows better than to think he's a good

3357
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:04,192
Source of the law

3358
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:07,264
This gets a big old who cares from

3359
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:10,080
I generally are on the side of Labor

3360
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:12,640
So I would say that the employer probably shouldn't

3361
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:15,712
Issue just posting

3362
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:17,504
Dumb memes online or whatever

3363
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:20,320
But also accept there might be a whole lot more post

3364
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:23,136
But I'm not aware of it and I can't possibly be bothered to look for

3365
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:26,720
And honestly the solution to this problem isn't going on Alex is showing

3366
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:27,488
Complaining about

3367
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:29,280
Dumfries Peach

3368
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:31,584
Fighting for stronger protections her employees

3369
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,680
Yeah you would think that strike you can't now you can't have Union

3370
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,472
You need protections for employees

3371
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,032
And employers me to just

3372
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:44,128
Willingly give those out as we all know they they were always

3373
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:45,408
Protecting their

3374
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:47,456
Western Christian

3375
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:50,528
Ethos make these employers

3376
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:57,696
Whatever possibly can't care about Alex making a big deal out of someone possibly being fired for supporting Trump when he didn't give a

3377
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:59,744
S*** about people were actually fired

3378
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,512
Specific

3379
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:02,048
Because they supported Obama

3380
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:08,448
In November 2012 The Huffington Post cover the case of a man who owned an aviation Service Company in Georgia

3381
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,728
Fire two employees

3382
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:11,520
Specifically because they voted for Obama

3383
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,080
Is part of his backlash for Obamacare

3384
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:15,872
But I'm sure Alex

3385
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:17,408
Cry about that on air

3386
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,456
Strange you're plenty of other cases like that

3387
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:20,224
People fired

3388
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:21,248
Transporting Obama

3389
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,552
But pointing out apocracy is meaningless

3390
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:25,088
I only bring up this point

3391
02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:26,112
At all

3392
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:27,392
To help explain

3393
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:32,256
That what's going on here is not Alex being offended that someone would be fired for their political beliefs

3394
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:33,536
It's a play

3395
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:35,328
He's putting on to amplify feelings of

3396
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:36,096
The political Vic

3397
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:39,680
Anyway Alex interviews her about how she likes Trump

3398
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:40,704
Because

3399
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,472
He can't

3400
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:43,008
Handle covering this news

3401
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:45,568
About these Neo-Nazi arrest

3402
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:51,968
It doesn't seem like he wants to get to it doesn't seem like he's not interested in terms of like he just doesn't cover the story

3403
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:57,088
Wildly incredibly interested in not talking about

3404
02:32:57,344 --> 02:32:57,856
Seems like he's

3405
02:32:58,112 --> 02:33:04,256
Desperately trying to fling himself in the other direction

3406
02:33:04,512 --> 02:33:07,328
And he also says that this interview was set up on short notice

3407
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:10,656
Seems like all of this good Feller this is red

3408
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,936
See what I don't

3409
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:12,960
Is

3410
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:15,264
If it were me and I'm pulling this s***

3411
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:21,664
I would have I would have brought up that the professor who got fired over saying you should

3412
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:24,736
If you want some targets hear some cultural

3413
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:26,272
That guy got fired

3414
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:28,064
Right and sure you disagree with

3415
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:29,856
Here's a cheap White

3416
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:30,880
Nobody cares

3417
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:31,648
About hypocrisy

3418
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:35,232
Nobody gives a s*** you just point that out and be like see look I'm

3419
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:40,864
I don't care I'm all about free speech

3420
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:41,632
Imply

3421
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:42,912
Anyway

3422
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:46,496
Coming to this and I thought well this'll be skippable

3423
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:52,896
Skip about now cuz in the middle of the interview this dental assistant baby

3424
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:54,176
Comes over

3425
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:58,272
Alex decides it would be a good idea to interview

3426
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,832
He gets a little bit esoteric

3427
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:01,856
And

3428
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:03,648
This is one of the creepy or things

3429
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:04,672
That I've heard on his show

3430
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:09,280
Because you said I was your baby bring your baby

3431
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:15,168
He wants to see if he heard your voice

3432
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,264
Hey what's your name Buddy

3433
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:24,384
That's awesome you love your mommy

3434
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,968
You love God

3435
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,552
Yeah you know God loves you

3436
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,136
You look just like your mommy

3437
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:39,488
What do you

3438
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,280
What do you want to do when you grow up

3439
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:46,912
Spider-Man

3440
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:49,984
You know a Spider-Man semi-auto is Ono

3441
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:55,872
Comes great responsibility you know you have a lot of power

3442
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:03,552
Diseases

3443
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:10,976
Are you watching years from now

3444
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:16,608
Boy

3445
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:20,192
Knowing the web

3446
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,472
To this three-year-old

3447
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:23,264
Knowing the web

3448
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,544
Is the web

3449
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:27,104
Yeah I mean for Alex like all of his talk

3450
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:32,480
All the time about like globalist wanting to take children his interaction with a child is

3451
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,528
Unnerving

3452
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:35,808
3 p.m.

3453
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,088
Man you know what

3454
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,112
Here's the worst part

3455
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:40,672
I think Alex really does love Spider-Man

3456
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:47,072
Baby and I think you really did hate Spider-Man into the into the spider-verse probably because there was a because mph

3457
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:47,840
Elsa Spider-Man

3458
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:49,888
And he was notoriously non-white

3459
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:50,656
And yet

3460
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,448
That's the best Spider-Man movie

3461
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:57,824
This is why racism is bad you don't even get to enjoy the best Spider-Man movie

3462
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:04,224
But yes there are other reasons for a little bit longer

3463
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:06,016
Upset how did it go

3464
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:09,344
And ask her baby out on

3465
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,392
Eventually you be mother

3466
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:15,232
Sit down

3467
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:19,584
They just talked about her jobs great news you should have been fired

3468
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,352
Whatever

3469
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,120
B

3470
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:22,144
They get to

3471
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,168
A commercial break

3472
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:23,936
And Alex

3473
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:24,704
Gives up again

3474
02:36:25,472 --> 02:36:27,264
I'm trying to find an attorney that

3475
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:31,872
Perfect for the situation and I've had a few people contact me

3476
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:38,272
It's a very very fine line because Wisconsin is that state where they can fire

3477
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:44,672
Are you for anything or do it because

3478
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:49,280
Political news

3479
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:50,304
I'm here

3480
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,632
You see that the mask for concern for the law Slips Away

3481
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:55,680
Now it's revealed what this is really about

3482
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:56,704
He feels

3483
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:59,520
Attacks by proxy because this woman is saying she was fired

3484
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:01,312
Because she supports Trump and all he wants

3485
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,336
Is Payback

3486
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:05,920
He knows damn well that you can be fired for political beliefs

3487
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,944
For no reason at all

3488
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:09,504
Wisconsin's an at-will employment

3489
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:11,296
And political belief is not up

3490
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:13,344
Protected category of speech in unemployment

3491
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,112
Setting

3492
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:15,904
He's been pretending that it is

3493
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Energy

3494
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:18,464
But here at the end he acknowledges that

3495
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:19,488
It's not about that

3496
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,304
Who cares what the lawyers say this company needs to

3497
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,072
Be punished

3498
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,632
He doesn't want to punish them for breaking the law

3499
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:28,960
He wants to punish because they've done something he sees as being against

3500
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:29,984
The world of truck

3501
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:32,288
This isn't about anything other than Venge

3502
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:35,360
Anyone who's against the leader be punished

3503
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:42,016
This is a super f*****-up especially as a way to sort of wrap up this interview there was about other people firing her Worth or Terry

3504
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:43,552
Whatever

3505
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:45,600
I was noses audience won't even notice who gives

3506
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,904
It's always so fresh

3507
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:48,672
Frustrating to me

3508
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,464
When when we're being

3509
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,232
Like

3510
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:53,536
When people on the left are being demonized

3511
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:56,608
Where the evil ones were trying to destroy everybody

3512
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:59,424
And then you hear this interview and you like lady

3513
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:01,216
The stuff I believe

3514
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:04,032
Would have protected you too

3515
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:05,312
Even though I just

3516
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:07,104
Disagree with you more likely

3517
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:11,456
Even though you disagree with me what I'm going for would benefit the both of

3518
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:14,272
And what you want then if it

3519
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:16,320
Not even you

3520
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:17,600
Doesn't seem like it

3521
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:21,440
Late I thought that was going to be the end of the interview

3522
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:23,744
Well it turns out when they come back

3523
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,512
Be engaged

3524
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:25,280
Some pretty

3525
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:26,304
Bucked up Behavior

3526
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:29,120
This person really like

3527
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:35,776
You need to put him on blast

3528
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:37,568
Completely Mia

3529
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:49,856
Listen to Rivers which is Lake Norris

3530
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:59,584
Someone creeping around making sure women lose their job for the president

3531
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:04,192
He's a real person

3532
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:07,776
Belize women I'm surprised

3533
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:12,640
I understand how this woman probably feels like it's no big deal to say this guy's name on Alex's show

3534
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:16,736
And point out that he's the reason she got fired but Alex would really have learned his license

3535
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,552
He's currently being sued for his pardoning

3536
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:24,928
It's getting of harassment experienced by the Sandy Hook families and now here he is essentially dachshund this dude

3537
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:26,208
And saying that he likes

3538
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:26,976
Tabouli women

3539
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:33,888
Alex's audience is probably not nearly as potentially dangerous as it once was but this is so f****** your response

3540
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:35,168
Possible no matter what

3541
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:36,960
Alex can't do this order

3542
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:38,752
Putting Targets on private sitting

3543
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:41,312
Whether or not he feels like they deserve it

3544
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:43,104
I just don't think he cares

3545
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:47,968
What happens because he wants people who he feels of wrong Trump supporters to be punished

3546
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:51,552
Hopefully this doesn't lead to another lawsuit for him

3547
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:53,344
This is

3548
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,368
This very night

3549
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:55,904
Shefit

3550
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,184
She just has no idea

3551
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,976
Has no idea she's

3552
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:01,536
She's talking to him I don't know

3553
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:03,328
Oh yeah he's this guy like

3554
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:06,912
He's lives up in there that she doesn't realize

3555
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:08,704
Maybe see if

3556
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:10,240
Maybe I can't believe

3557
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:13,568
I don't know I mean they talk some more about needing to go after

3558
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:17,920
Okay well then nevermind f*** her

3559
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:20,992
Is being cited as a lot about the dental office and stuff

3560
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:22,272
Precision Dental

3561
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:28,672
And Blasting all them same time they should be blasting this guy if he never made

3562
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:31,232
That post a review I still be at work

3563
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,792
Be at work right now

3564
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:35,840
So you're saying you're saying

3565
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:38,656
Why do I burn Precision Dental when we should go

3566
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,216
This

3567
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:44,544
All American

3568
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:46,592
This wannabe slave master

3569
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:53,760
I think that we should go out there both it's a big deal you know I was wrongfully fired because of his Rubio

3570
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:58,880
Maybe she's talking about suing him or engaging in illegal process but she's in

3571
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:04,768
Is not not the sort of thing

3572
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:05,792
Anybody should being gay

3573
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:07,840
These people are so stupid

3574
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:10,656
Yeah so they have this interview is pointless and

3575
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:13,216
That's a pretty close after this

3576
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:16,032
And immediately gets to his neck

3577
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:19,104
Right we're not going to talk about this gas and I'm going to

3578
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:21,664
Explain why after this clip

3579
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,432
But this

3580
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:23,968
Really worried

3581
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:25,760
Cuz Alex started talking

3582
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:29,088
About his lies about this Texas assessment report

3583
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:32,928
Auntie was trying to describe his own narrative

3584
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,976
I kind of got the sense

3585
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:36,000
Is it

3586
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:38,048
This is really troubling

3587
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,328
We got our nice guy

3588
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,376
I just want to get the shop

3589
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:44,704
State Police Department report

3590
02:41:45,472 --> 02:41:47,008
Wikipedia portal years ago

3591
02:41:47,264 --> 02:41:48,800
Incels

3592
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:52,128
People that are in the posthumanist movement environmental movement

3593
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:56,736
Involuntary

3594
02:41:59,040 --> 02:41:59,808
Celibacy

3595
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:02,112
Almost every Mass shooter

3596
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:06,208
That clip makes me pretty concerned that Alex doesn't know what an incel

3597
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:11,584
Like if you were to ask me my first response wouldn't be someone who's into posthumanist moved

3598
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,864
Environmental movement

3599
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,632
Some satanism

3600
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:14,656
I

3601
02:42:15,168 --> 02:42:15,936
Without a doubt

3602
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:19,776
Say that they are people who are into involuntary celibate

3603
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:24,640
That's kind of right there in the word in a voluntary bit of an oxymoron

3604
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:25,664
There's a

3605
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:29,504
Baseline issue year that Alex is absolutely lying about this Texas threat assessment

3606
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,296
Report that he definitely hasn't read

3607
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,112
Eclipse like this really make me deeply worried

3608
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:36,672
But he doesn't even have a conceptual grasp

3609
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:37,440
On the stuff

3610
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:38,464
You say

3611
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:40,768
If he doesn't know what an incel is

3612
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:43,840
How can you possibly have any understanding of what he's talking about

3613
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:48,704
Really scary the level of irresponsibility seems to be approaching his job

3614
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,472
Gazette

3615
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:55,104
That's f***** up yeah for somebody who even in his in his own f*****-up worldview is

3616
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:55,872
Obsessed with

3617
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
Chivalry

3618
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,432
I would

3619
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:00,480
Also

3620
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:02,272
So I can't talk about this

3621
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:03,552
Next gas

3622
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:05,600
He's a guy he's the guy

3623
02:43:05,856 --> 02:43:08,928
Who disrupted the mass shooter at the church in Sutherland

3624
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:13,792
I'm not going to cover this interview primarily because I don't want to appear to be judging

3625
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:14,816
In the sky too harshly

3626
02:43:15,584 --> 02:43:20,192
I read an article about him in Texas monthly and he seems like a decent guy what a life-changing

3627
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:20,960
Experience

3628
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:24,288
And since he's been cast as the archetype of a good guy with a gun

3629
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:27,360
I'll read you a little bit here from the article

3630
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:30,944
You didn't ask to be a citation in someone else's debate

3631
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:33,248
Is experiences more than a datapoint

3632
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:35,040
Those seven minutes ravaged

3633
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:37,600
This guy and I do not

3634
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:38,880
See eye-to-eye on politic

3635
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
At all

3636
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,928
But you seem earnest

3637
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:44,512
Is that like he's anti-abortion

3638
02:43:44,768 --> 02:43:48,352
He also says in the interview that some of the stuff Alex is saying sounds like a

3639
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:50,144
Conspiracy he doesn't want to engage with it

3640
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:57,056
Any intro to the interview Alex makes it clear that this guy had no idea who Alex was before agreeing to come on the show so I'm

3641
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:57,824
I'm going to give him a pass

3642
02:43:58,080 --> 02:43:58,848
Answered not beat him up

3643
02:43:59,104 --> 02:43:59,616
Making

3644
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:00,384
The bad choice

3645
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,152
Show to go on

3646
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:02,176
Yeah it doesn't

3647
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:02,944
Seymour

3648
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:03,712
Anyone's time

3649
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:05,504
But

3650
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:07,040
Because this guy is on

3651
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,344
He didn't know who Al

3652
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:11,904
But his wife had told him

3653
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:12,928
That he

3654
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:14,720
Lied about Sandy Hook

3655
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:15,744
So

3656
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:18,560
In the intro to the interview

3657
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:20,608
Alex start rationalizing

3658
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:21,632
His behavior

3659
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:22,912
About Sandy Hook

3660
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,192
Aunt

3661
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:25,728
Accidentally

3662
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:29,312
Admits exactly what he's a goddamn

3663
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:32,128
What an idiot this is this is

3664
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
Basically

3665
02:44:33,152 --> 02:44:33,664
Confession

3666
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:40,320
Everything's out here. There's nothing nothing sacred are none of it

3667
02:44:40,832 --> 02:44:42,368
And I used to follow Abby internet.

3668
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:46,976
You know cuz that's like we don't believe this happened with bloggers this anomaly

3669
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:51,072
I found out well I think that did happen.

3670
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:52,864
The minute though

3671
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:56,448
I went and said I stopped

3672
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,848
If you you said nobody. You lied about that you do that

3673
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:07,200
To make it my identity when I hardly ever talked about it so I want my identity back

3674
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:09,504
And I understand it's not about me

3675
02:45:10,016 --> 02:45:10,784
It's about

3676
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:12,320
How they change the subject

3677
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:16,672
In that clip Alex just basically admitted to what he's being accused of in this lawsuit

3678
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:21,024
What are you saying is that back in the day you just believe whatever he read on dumb

3679
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:22,560
Conspiracy sites online

3680
02:45:23,072 --> 02:45:25,888
Let's be honest that's not a back-in-the-day thing that's basically his business

3681
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:32,288
Two back in the day I was seeing all these anomalies online about the Sandy Hook shooting and he was convinced of them

3682
02:45:32,544 --> 02:45:33,056
Mantelli was

3683
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:34,848
And then when he said that he thought the shooting

3684
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:37,664
Did happen that's when people pounced and accused him of lying

3685
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,456
This demonstrates

3686
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:43,296
A fundamental misunderstanding about why what he did was bad

3687
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:45,856
It's not so much a matter of him lying about it

3688
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:51,488
It said he took these conspiracy completely baseless and fraudulent claims that he read online

3689
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,816
Almost all of which came from Jim Fetzer and Wolfgang halbig

3690
02:45:55,072 --> 02:45:56,096
And you reported them

3691
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:57,632
As fact on his show

3692
02:45:58,144 --> 02:45:59,168
You didn't report them as

3693
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:00,960
The internet has a question about this thing

3694
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:03,519
Whether or not it's actually strange

3695
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:07,871
He just repeated bulshit from the internet and pretended that it came from real sources

3696
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,151
Honestly I

3697
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:10,687
I think that clip is about to occur

3698
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:11,455
Fashion

3699
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:14,271
Announcing go f*** himself cuz I want my identity back bowls

3700
02:46:14,527 --> 02:46:15,039
Yeah I know

3701
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:16,319
Now you don't you

3702
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:17,087
You earned

3703
02:46:17,599 --> 02:46:19,135
Yeah that is your identity

3704
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:20,671
Yep you got to own it

3705
02:46:20,927 --> 02:46:22,719
And you don't want to know

3706
02:46:24,767 --> 02:46:27,071
Alex has Matt Bracken hosting the 4th hour

3707
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:29,887
16th and it is worthwhile.

3708
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:31,167
To know that

3709
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:35,775
Matt Bracken also recently made an appearance on Red Ice Radio

3710
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:39,871
Supremacist Neo-Nazi adjacent show that

3711
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:42,175
He was on there to talk about the

3712
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:46,527
Situation. I assume he was against

3713
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:47,807
No

3714
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:51,903
It was used against the way they got

3715
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:53,695
He is against

3716
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:55,743
The globalist

3717
02:46:55,999 --> 02:46:57,023
Trying to set up

3718
02:46:58,047 --> 02:47:01,375
He was up to no good

3719
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:02,655
He comes on

3720
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:04,703
Alex said does a little segments

3721
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:06,751
The 4th hour

3722
02:47:07,007 --> 02:47:09,311
And the audio is a little bit different on this

3723
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:10,847
I'm not entirely sure why

3724
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:12,383
But

3725
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:14,431
Because I have a little bit of fun

3726
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:20,831
On the way out here

3727
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:57,087
That sucks it was all just leading to a false flag

3728
02:48:57,343 --> 02:48:57,855
Sing all along

3729
02:48:58,111 --> 02:49:04,255
Also I think the Dave Mustaine probably was like I used to write my album haha

3730
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:08,351
Imagine he's not here

3731
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:13,727
Very derivatives Galaxy's angling to write his own Metal Opera

3732
02:49:15,519 --> 02:49:17,567
Ubv like a

3733
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:22,943
Shatner

3734
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:26,015
Talking weirdly over

3735
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:29,599
And everybody knows that when the alien

3736
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:31,135
They will find us

3737
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:32,415
Subway

3738
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,439
So

3739
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:38,303
How to use in 4th hour like his mood

3740
02:49:40,095 --> 02:49:40,607
At the end

3741
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:41,375
And

3742
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:43,679
I have I have a slightly different thought

3743
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:45,215
About his behavior than

3744
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:46,239
How he described

3745
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:50,591
Virginia

3746
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:06,975
About 1 a.m.

3747
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:18,239
Alex has absolutely not been in a good mood

3748
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:21,055
So he's been very weird and yelling about the devil

3749
02:50:21,823 --> 02:50:24,383
I guess he's not in as bad a mood as one might expect

3750
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:25,151
Considering the

3751
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:28,223
And I think the reason for that is not that he's been feeling

3752
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:28,991
Spirit

3753
02:50:29,247 --> 02:50:30,271
It's been he's been that

3754
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:32,063
Textbook definition of Escapist

3755
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:33,087
On this show

3756
02:50:33,599 --> 02:50:37,439
There's real news cover but instead of talking about any of the stuff you supposed to know about

3757
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:39,487
You rambled about abortion

3758
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:40,511
Michelle wolf

3759
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:43,583
But now Brian stelter is ugly than interview dental assisting

3760
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:44,863
Alex is a

3761
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:47,167
Because there's a story that he needed to add

3762
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:50,239
And he couldn't even bring himself to talk about it at all

3763
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:53,055
Two cells of suspected white supremacist terrorist

3764
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:57,151
At least one of them having plans to attend the rally and Rich

3765
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:58,431
And all Alex

3766
02:50:58,687 --> 02:51:00,991
Can do is make vague pronouncements by false Flags

3767
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:03,039
And why is ass off about the Texas Reddit

3768
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:04,575
This is a week

3769
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:05,599
Weak man

3770
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:08,671
The news about the first three men arrested in broke

3771
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:11,487
Going in the hill by 11:41 Eastern Time

3772
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:14,815
64 an hour and a half before he went on air Austin time

3773
02:51:15,327 --> 02:51:16,095
There's no excuse for

3774
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:18,911
The rally is an event he's been building up his

3775
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:20,703
The sight of a globalist false-flag that

3776
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:22,239
It will start the next civil war

3777
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:24,031
And he's attending the event

3778
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:26,335
This is a major major news story that

3779
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:28,895
Very relevant to his coverage and honestly

3780
02:51:29,151 --> 02:51:30,687
You have a responsibility to address

3781
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:34,783
Even if it's just to say that they're false-flag globalist neo-nazis

3782
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:35,551
Is there something

3783
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:36,831
But he's too chickenshit

3784
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:39,135
Steven Steakhouse flag there yeah that's

3785
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:40,159
It is

3786
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:42,719
It could not be more glaring in it

3787
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:46,303
It could not be more an admission of guilt

3788
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:52,959
I think I mean enough for a guilty

3789
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:54,751
I feel like if I had to guess

3790
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,031
It is probably as a

3791
02:51:56,287 --> 02:51:57,055
Situation where he's like

3792
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:01,407
I don't want to alienate I don't want to say that I don't

3793
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:06,015
This is the infuriating kind of Alex Jones

3794
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:09,087
He's right here he's an embodiment of a very serious problem

3795
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,367
I would summon up like the

3796
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:17,279
Most people would not have a problem with normal law-abiding citizens carrying guns at a second amendment rally

3797
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:19,071
It's kind of what you would expect

3798
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,887
The problem lies in the extremist album

3799
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:26,239
They've been drawn to this rally with the constant over-the-top the next to the Lord's going to start

3800
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:28,543
Does a false-flag plan to Global it's going to do it

3801
02:52:29,311 --> 02:52:35,199
Without the propaganda machine that Hypes up these sorts of events this rally would not be taken on the sort of character that it is

3802
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:36,735
And Alex and his ilk

3803
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:38,271
Have played a role in causing that

3804
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:40,063
And Alex don't give a s***

3805
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:42,879
Even if there is a shooting at the rally he won't be there

3806
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:49,279
He's pretending he's going to this rally but he barely doesn't he basically doesn't even these events outside of his armor

3807
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:50,047
Tank anymore

3808
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:52,863
I'm certainly not going to let that get close to where the people are

3809
02:52:53,119 --> 02:52:54,911
This is a marketing offered

3810
02:52:55,167 --> 02:52:55,679
Tunity for Ally

3811
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:59,775
His brand is the Second Amendment guy in 1776

3812
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:01,055
I'm going to start again guy

3813
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:04,639
Do you go to Virginia like you Xanax are going to La for Pilots

3814
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:05,919
He's going for

3815
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:07,455
Exposure all the wild

3816
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:08,223
The people of rich

3817
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:09,247
Men have to deal with

3818
02:53:10,527 --> 02:53:11,295
Like this

3819
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:12,319
Is just disgusting

3820
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:16,671
I can't stress enough like

3821
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:18,463
He had to talk about

3822
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:20,511
Yeah he had to

3823
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:21,791
And he didn't

3824
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:22,559
Yep

3825
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:23,327
That's

3826
02:53:26,655 --> 02:53:27,167
You can't

3827
02:53:27,423 --> 02:53:28,191
You just can't

3828
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:29,983
Yeah like that's not a thing that

3829
02:53:30,495 --> 02:53:33,055
Can be done that's not an acceptable thing to do

3830
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:34,847
It is simply

3831
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:40,735
I don't even and you'd I don't even know where to begin with policing that kind of concept all I know is that

3832
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:43,295
From any any reasonable standpoint

3833
02:53:43,551 --> 02:53:44,575
Him doing

3834
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:45,855
Nothing but

3835
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:46,623
Bugging

3836
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:49,951
God is saying this and Brian Seltzer's a demon

3837
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:50,975
After is

3838
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:53,279
Insanely inflammatory rhetoric

3839
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:56,607
Helped to lead to the situation that we are currently in

3840
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:59,423
Not that I'm giving him any kind of direct blame for these

3841
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:01,471
But it is f******

3842
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:02,751
Imperative

3843
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:04,287
That he say

3844
02:54:05,567 --> 02:54:06,591
Bad or

3845
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:08,895
Horsefly

3846
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:11,967
But even then he's staying

3847
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:19,391
He's at least saying that committing a terrorist Act

3848
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:20,671
Is out bad thing

3849
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:21,695
But even from

3850
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:25,279
Early part of the show where Alex says

3851
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:27,327
They're going to try and kill Trump this week

3852
02:54:27,839 --> 02:54:29,119
Like I sent

3853
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:31,167
Becky's aware of that new

3854
02:54:31,679 --> 02:54:32,703
I don't think

3855
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:33,727
The he's unaware

3856
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:34,751
No he can't

3857
02:54:35,007 --> 02:54:39,359
And that's one of the parts of it that makes it really difficult for me to swallow this entire show

3858
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:41,151
It is just Escapist

3859
02:54:41,663 --> 02:54:44,735
It is just a rambling about abortion in North America

3860
02:54:44,991 --> 02:54:45,503
Michelle wolf

3861
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:46,783
Stelter

3862
02:54:47,039 --> 02:54:47,807
And the devil

3863
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:50,367
And interviewing a dental assistant in the guy with the

3864
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:51,135
Disrupted the shooting

3865
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:52,159
Glen Springs

3866
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:52,927
Almost like

3867
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:55,231
Anything not to cover

3868
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,583
You need to it is simply a

3869
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,607
Possible for him

3870
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:01,375
Do not know about

3871
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:03,935
If if we get a if I get a

3872
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:08,543
Tweet whenever like 5 minutes after I kaitlinbennett things go goes viral

3873
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:09,823
He got a f******

3874
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:10,591
Text

3875
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:11,615
2 seconds

3876
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:14,943
After that he'll Atwood

3877
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:16,991
6 hours before that thing

3878
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:18,783
Somebody we know is going down

3879
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:20,319
Also to that point

3880
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:23,647
National Treasure

3881
02:55:23,903 --> 02:55:24,671
World

3882
02:55:24,927 --> 02:55:26,975
Squirrel

3883
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:31,839
2

3884
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:34,911
Basically not

3885
02:55:35,167 --> 02:55:35,679
Samantha post

3886
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,215
But

3887
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:37,983
Before he does

3888
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:39,263
Alex

3889
02:55:41,567 --> 02:55:44,639
Teach other and kill each other all day ever what color we are

3890
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:47,967
And they're manipulating as the

3891
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:53,599
Supposed savior saying oh we're going to take your rights and Liberties way to stop the racism

3892
02:55:56,927 --> 02:55:57,951
It's disgusting

3893
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:01,535
We don't need white guilt and we don't need

3894
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:06,143
We don't need to be

3895
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:06,911
Frankie lights

3896
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:15,615
I don't go down here almost every weekend eat at the local

3897
02:56:16,127 --> 02:56:18,175
Soul food places black people on it

3898
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:25,087
That'll just get back to you with what you stand for you produce that Talia measure thing

3899
02:56:26,367 --> 02:56:28,671
Jimi Hendrix

3900
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:32,511
Credible

3901
02:56:33,023 --> 02:56:34,047
Well that settles it

3902
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:35,327
He's not racist

3903
02:56:39,935 --> 02:56:43,263
They're planning something big in Virginia by knows it imma be on the ground there

3904
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:47,871
A lot of money to go to Virginia

3905
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:49,407
Different to a plug

3906
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:58,879
You did a pre-recorded thing about I shouldn't have white guilt and everybody's great my love soul food Jimi Hendrix music is great I'm out of races today

3907
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:07,327
Go to Virginia alright alright Alex I know you're not going to be in studio tomorrow so we just got we just got to record

3908
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:10,911
We just need you to plug this so we can cover some of these cost

3909
02:57:11,167 --> 02:57:13,983
I know it seems crazy okay so we're just going to start with

3910
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:16,799
We have a lot of great products go ahead and start there

3911
02:57:17,567 --> 02:57:20,127
No okay no you're doing a lot of weird right now

3912
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:25,247
Okay no I think that's great I think that's great let's just start from the top

3913
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:27,551
Okay that's still not even like

3914
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:29,855
Directly addressing the situation

3915
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:34,719
But it's all still like there's a big plant they're going to do all those applying something big

3916
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:37,023
And that constant drumbeat of like

3917
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:39,839
This is going to be a false flag there going to be a false flag

3918
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:41,631
It's all just super irresponsible

3919
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:43,423
I detest it I find this

3920
02:57:43,679 --> 02:57:44,191
Tubi

3921
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:44,959
Like a

3922
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:46,495
It is

3923
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:47,775
Life is real

3924
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:48,543
And

3925
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:50,079
This sort of s***

3926
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,895
Trickling into the real world

3927
02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:53,663
Is just

3928
02:57:53,919 --> 02:57:55,455
Where is

3929
02:57:55,711 --> 02:57:56,223
So much

3930
02:57:58,271 --> 02:58:01,599
Right-wing media is simply not held accountable for in

3931
02:58:01,855 --> 02:58:02,367
In terms of

3932
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:03,647
Joking this

3933
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:06,975
Constant paranoia in order to take it

3934
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:08,255
Advantage of these people

3935
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:09,535
In terms of money invo

3936
02:58:10,047 --> 02:58:11,839
Yep that is that is what

3937
02:58:12,095 --> 02:58:13,887
The conservative media sphere is

3938
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:15,423
Is doing and has done

3939
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:17,727
And we'll never be loyal to count of

3940
02:58:17,983 --> 02:58:18,495
Go for it I guess

3941
02:58:19,007 --> 02:58:20,543
I guess that's just not something that I have

3942
02:58:21,055 --> 02:58:22,847
It doesn't seem like it's a high priority

3943
02:58:23,103 --> 02:58:23,615
Nope

3944
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:25,151
Anyway

3945
02:58:26,175 --> 02:58:26,943
We come to the end of this

3946
02:58:27,199 --> 02:58:29,759
All I can really say is I hope that

3947
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:34,879
Calmer heads prevail and everything is alright

3948
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:39,487
And the things go off without any incidents but I have no ideas

3949
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:41,279
The recording is on Sunday like I said

3950
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:42,303
Enza

3951
02:58:44,095 --> 02:58:48,959
I mean this is this episode sucks and it's mostly just extended Alex being

3952
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:49,727
I douche

3953
02:58:49,983 --> 02:58:50,751
And

3954
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:53,823
Trying to play preamp to groundwork for

3955
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:55,103
Narrative

3956
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:56,383
No matter what

3957
02:58:56,639 --> 02:58:57,407
Yeah now

3958
02:58:58,175 --> 02:58:59,199
That is all stupid

3959
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:00,223
But

3960
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:05,087
We did get to hear Alex interview babe

3961
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:07,135
Now here's the other thing though that

3962
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:09,183
Include him in interview

3963
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:10,719
Every manager

3964
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:12,767
To be shameful in

3965
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:15,071
Every single possible aspect

3966
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:16,607
Of running a broadcast

3967
02:59:17,119 --> 02:59:19,167
True I mean is he didn't miss

3968
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:20,191
Anything
