00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have a great respect for Tenaya Lodge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Saline it's like a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Question for you

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
What's up

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
My bright spot today

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
Big Show

11
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
I need some

12
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:21,152
Be watching

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,504
So I had Survivor last time around which is great

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
Made it all the way through

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
I very legally got you some New Zealand Survivor I believe so

16
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Tapped into that you actually forgot that I had that and I would also like to

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
To say

18
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Text Jordan

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
So I was looking around

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,056
On Paramount plus haha I saw that they had two unsolved mystery

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
Can I watch a couple days I was texting you about everything

22
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Seems to happen at gas station

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Aldi crime

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Gas station

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Say we can gas station in the 90s

26
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Stay with my f****** gas station

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Show me was like the Town Square

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Okay execution-style murder and then the next story is about we found a bag of mail

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
And I will never know where this male is this is so is so totally inconsistent I am not going to

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Watching you this year

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,992
Execution-style murder that's very very lucky with mail also maybe there's goes

32
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
Style that's probably bad

33
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,904
So I decided to skip away from that so-called contraction master

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
Edith is great

35
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
It is a game show. That name through

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,632
Little clunky option master

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,008
There's this guy who kind of looks like a friendly happy British

38
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
Al Pacino okay

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,920
He's hosting a show where two teams compete to create contractions

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
The Purge episode like

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
I think it's they have to

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Get this to the tea kettle turned on haha from the tub so it's all Rube Goldberg all Rube Goldberg

43
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Okay machine

44
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
53 days one in the room to make these elaborate Contraption I love

45
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Yeah

46
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
The guy who judges it every episode he's like a

47
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
World famous

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Contraption Baker

49
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
What are the weather

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
I think it's called a chain reaction machine circles

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Rube Goldberg

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
Respect about it is even he is like

53
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
I love

54
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
These things because they're so cartoonish there's a recognition of how ridiculous

55
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
They have a great respect for like

56
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
Explaining to the audience

57
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Physics little bit

58
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
There's be like here's why

59
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
There's a light educational aspect fun I really really like it

60
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Happened was

61
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
The British Bake Off

62
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,720
Exploded and then Britain has slowly claude's

63
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
Through every possible thing that they could get

64
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
A small group

65
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Put people to do

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,703
Competitively through Pottery they've gone through gardening

67
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
They've gone through

68
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
I mean it

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,127
It's it's absurd I don't watch most of them I will tell you I don't know how they do it

70
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Yeah the contraption ones good that's great recommended I appreciate it I don't know how they got that Dave through

71
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,647
Master is not

72
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,255
What is

73
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815

Tastic

76
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,447
And I think I think you will appreciate the name

77
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
My man is demon time

78
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,383
It's demons

79
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
I don't know I think there's something as I want to attract

80
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
Something like that but it's fantastic

81
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Really really good ears what's great about this

82
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
I have no idea who this is

83
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
And if I were to guess what

84
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
Genre it is give me a hot or cold

85
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Classical

00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Hot

00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Hot hotter

89
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Instrumental Hip Hop

90
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783

91
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Yes

Ihiphop really okay

95
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Dial pops whenever a producer does

96
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Hip-hop albums

97
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079

Some of that that genre

102
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
All over the place it was an amazing track

103
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Really really good

104
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Problem with that title

105
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
I'm not a square

106
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
U8 sounds like a square

107
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
I just remember how funny I thought it was

108
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,103
When Akon and Eminem came out with that song I want to f*** you

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919

111
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Right

112
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
I appreciated that and what what makes me laugh makes me laugh is now

113
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
Not that that I appreciate the reservoir with snoops

114
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Snoop Dogg I'm not sure it makes me laugh it is

115
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Let's make love

116
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Parentheses

117
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
With Tim McGraw

118
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,079
And it'll never it'll never did Faith Hill and Tim McGraw duet let's make love

119
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
It's titled let's make love parentheses with Tim McGraw I don't know why

120
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
That's the worst thing I've ever heard

121
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271
It's a terrible it's terrible

122
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295

125
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Trying to track the

126
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,935
Goings-on of Alex on his show as the trial progresses

127
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Not much not much

128
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
We lived in reality during this time

129
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
You're dumb

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
Pizza but it's not dumping an interesting way

131
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Kind of like

132
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Blustery but not in a font look at

I don't know

134
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
There's not a lot

135
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Is what I'm saying

136
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Picking on those bones

137
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767

I just might you are not

187
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
I have

188
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Risen above

189
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
A list for me

190
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
And then we're going to

191
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Comeback

192
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
And I'm going to start the show over

193
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
I got plenty of words for you

194
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
At the end of the day

195
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
F*** you and your new world order

196
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
She wrote in on

197
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
All your s***

198
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Maybe today

199
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5

200
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Got to hear tomorrow

201
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
And you never see me again

202
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
I never want to come back here again

203
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
I apologize

204
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Was legitimately having break

205
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Weather tomorrow

206
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
It's not really no no

207
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Our contracts dropped from Today Show and I think this fits for just about anytime Alex has a gas

208
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
A special gas coming up next hour

209
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Moron

210
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
That's alright

211
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
That's always

212
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Alright okay

213
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,007
The 15th Alex begins and

214
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Getting repaired

215
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Empire is on the Run

216
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
On Amazon

217
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
World topping all charge

218
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Thanks for the people's hunger

219
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
4

220
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
The truth

221
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
The New York Times

222
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Okay

223
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
What's

224
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,887
Passed out in the men's room

225
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Yep so we got this we got this going on again

226
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
Multiple times on on this on this day

227
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Yeah you know I'm starting to get offended on behalf of

228
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Packer fan

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Eli's a good time Green Bay Stadium come on man it's cold out

230
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Cold

231
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
Tucker probably freeze to death he doesn't have anything he's got nothing on them

232
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,351
Packer fan so I decided to check in here with the the books

233
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
On Amazon

234
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
And when we last checked out to the number five

235
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Amazon telephone number for

236
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Steve Doocy number two

237
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Amazing

238
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Steve Doocy has arisen

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Number one

240
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
With his co-star

241
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
What is it going to take

242
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
For the world that makes sense

243
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Okay

244
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Here's what I need

245
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Alright I'm a huge fan of Steve Doocy

246
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
But I did not first not first

247
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,071
Political takes man his wife has some great recipes

248
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
That's what we're here for

249
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Jennette McCurdy number 5

250
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Alex has a number 12

251
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,383
Slide

252
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
I think the interest in that book his

253
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Probably

254
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Blown over

255
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Probably done what it's going to do

256
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
See if there's anything else in

257
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,767
I mean I could see it becoming like a I can see it becoming like a pie

258
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,375
Posthumus thing you know like people didn't really appreciate James Joyce until after he was dead

259
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
I think having not read the book

260
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
I can only compare it to what I assume is it

261
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
It's closest

262
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
Literary equivalent which is

263
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Ulysses

264
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
So I'm imagining that

265
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
The portrait of an artist as a dumb f***

266
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
That's a good one

267
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
Officers could be a good one on Alex's he toes The Very Hungry Caterpillar

268
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Alex

269
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
Pictures of Amazon sale

270
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
So little time

271
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,519
Past time to stop tooting your own horn.

272
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
So Alex is a very exciting

273
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Guest coming up later

274
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
The author of The Hunger Games

275
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
We have a huge gash

276
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
We worked at Health and Human Services

277
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
And was an advisor to president

278
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Trump

279
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Operation warp speed

280
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
Trump

281
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
For a fall

282
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
This is going to be a huge

283
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
In-studio interview

284
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
In 2 hours

285
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
1 p.m. Central Standard

286
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
Time really hyping this thing up

287
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
So this is Doctor Paul Alexander okay he's

288
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
I think he's been on before or at least Alex's talked about him cuz we've covered him he's the guy who was

289
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Like a radio guest

290
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
That was

291
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
How beloved by one of the people in Trump's Administration Caputo Michael Caputo

292
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
As an advisor to the HHS

293
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Community now

294
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,199
I've already talked about I don't know his interview was just like I thought everyone

295
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
How to get sick

296
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
That was a really vulnerable people in society and then just let everyone

297
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,999
Get it Damn the Torpedoes thing

298
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,095
Get off yeah I mean I would say somebody

299
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
Essentially arguing for a culling of human

300
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Beings

301
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Is probably not

302
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Can I give a good interview

303
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Well I can kind of understand where the thought comes from

304
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
You know like

305
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
Kind of understand I think it's misguided

306
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Yeah but like the

307
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
The notion of

308
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,135
Having a discussion about like whether her Divinity is the right way to go at the beginning of an outbreak

309
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
I can understand

310
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
One of the reasons that I think

311
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Especially now as we've gotten further on

312
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
I think one of the reasons why you wouldn't

313
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Necessarily want to do that for two

314
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,215
Clearly would like a really novel unknown thing is you don't know these

315
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
Yeah that's the one syndromes can be caused

316
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Brought on by having

317
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
The virus

318
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
And there's there's a lot of unknown unknown

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
So is it worth

320
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
I mean I do

321
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,319
Just come from it from this place of saying like

322
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
What is the point of living in the f***

323
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Future if your plan for dealing with a pandemic

324
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
I still like stay let's all get together and have a party and get sick and then it'll be over like a great Beatles song

325
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
Not good health strategy

326
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Space

327
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
I still have to get sick

328
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Bulshit

329
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,151
No refuse well I mean you can ask Alex to get the globalist

330
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,991
Health machines or whatever

331
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Absolutely

332
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
Going on

333
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
And that is

334
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
Immigrants Martha's Vineyard

335
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Yep yep

336
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:44,447
Some have described this as human trafficking I don't know how it is the definition

337
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,335
You can't lie to people

338
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Different state that's

339
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Lion guard

340
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
Legal level on some way right

341
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Alex loves

342
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Common sense

343
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
The governor of Texas finally doing something good

344
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
Florida

345
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
Are delivering illegal aliens to Kamala Harris's house

346
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Call Cheryl

347
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,239
Martha's Vineyard areas

348
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
Barack Obama and globalist

349
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Mansion

350
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
Yeah so I mean like if you want to look at this is human trafficking Alex thinks that's a good common-sense political

351
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Tool

352
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Cool the Ron DeSantis should be in prison

353
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
For this. But he's pulled

354
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,279
Because he has an opposition to immigration DeSantis chartered two flights and sent immigrants

355
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
To Martha's Vineyard specifically because it's an area that the

356
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
The symbol of rich

357
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Liberally

358
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,239
You can see how that your hand is very clear in the way that Alex describes the

359
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
If that all wasn't bad enough the immigrants were lied to when they were about where they were

360
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
One of them told reporters quote when we got on the plane they told us they would give us jobs a place to live everyday

361
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,671
Another said quote I simply feel misled because they told a lie and it is come

362
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Nothing

363
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,071
According to Domingo Garcia the president of the league of United Latin American citizens

364
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
The people who are who are being used as political props were even giving fake document

365
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
To fool them into thinking

366
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
That there was a morphe

367
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
Official back into the idea that jobs and housing were waiting for

368
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,711
Interesting Lee according to NPR these flights were paid for by DeSantis but originated Intex

369
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
Switch does seem to apply some level of f*****-up coordination

370
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
Between him and Texas governor Abbott

371
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Or else I guess maybe is this interstate

372
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Kidnapping

373
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Am I

374
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
Am I understanding this story correctly

375
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
So if a b DeSantis

376
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
A group of people

377
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
And it paid for

378
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
A group of

379
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,359
People were lied to were told that they were going to be given a better life

380
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
If they got on this plane

381
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
And then they landed

382
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,551
And it was a and then f******

383
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Like that's what happened

384
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
And then we're going to act like that's not a crime that if you were I did would be a crime for me to be a wild thing

385
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
NPR talk to some of the Immigrant

386
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Here's their description

387
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,751
The migrants said a Woman They identified as Perla approached

388
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
I'm outside the shelter in

389
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,663
Appliance saying that they would be flown to Boston where they could get expedited work paper

390
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
She provided them with food

391
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,063
The migrants said Perla was trying to recruit more passengers just hours before their

392
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
In addition to all this horrific bulshit

393
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
Didn't inform the folks doing the transportation of these migrants didn't inform officials in Martha's Vineyard of the beep

394
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
People's arrival

395
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
Specifically so they could be caught off-guard in

396
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Chaos would be more likely

397
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Because that's the goal here

398
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
This is an unacceptable and debased level of political theater where we need to stop as a country and recognize that

399
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Things have just gotten

400
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Too far

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
Accepting a really far past what's

402
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:12,319
The fact that the organizers of the stock which involves fraud potential human trafficking and possibly some other crimes have

403
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Arrested already is a

404
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Bucking bummer

405
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
The game is being played here is really simple

406
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Ron DeSantis wanted to send immigrants to Liberal areas because he hates immigrants and he thinks that Liberals are all talk when it comes to support

407
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Boarding immigration

408
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
Unfortunately if you were to inform officials in these liberal areas that immigrants were coming they would be able to prepare and accommodate

409
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
Which one really cause any problem

410
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Through the propaganda value in that

411
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
However if

412
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
You don't tell officials

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
Defraud the migrants with Promises of Housing and work

414
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,112
Can you create a situation where the officials in the liberal area of your targeting

415
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
We're going to be outraged

416
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
You can be super offended that you would do this to me

417
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
People and likely speak out against you for it

418
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,144
You ignore their criticism about how what you did was fraud and possibly human trafficking

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
And pretend they're just mad at you because you sent immigrants

420
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
It's the pressure other precious liberal Enclave

421
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,104
Event sell that message to your audience to reinforce your narrative

422
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
Reality no one wants immigrants around and Liberals are just lying about

423
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
F*** this s***

424
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
F*** these people and f*** Alex

425
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
And his inability to even be

426
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,368
Consistent with the one big thing you supposed to be

427
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Caring about so much

428
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Do the king of human trafficking

429
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Corrupt

430
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
Can sniffing it out manually care about any of his principles he claims mean so much

431
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Watch they're all negotiable when there's a chance to quote own the libs

432
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Or to advance

433
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Extreme right-wing

434
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Text yeah

435
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,824
Yeah it is it is nice to be reminded that laws are

436
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,456
Pretend though and they all you really need to do is amass enough power and it is small enough area that you can

437
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
Control that you can get away with doing whatever it is you want

438
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
It's I mean law. Don't mean anything if they're not arrest

439
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,488
I mean I appreciate that we're all up in arms about the Supreme Court's ruling

440
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
But if Ron DeSantis can do that

441
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
Then all you really need to do to get an abortion

442
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
Is it get a bunch of people around you with guns and then go get an abortion and then shoot somebody if they try to stop you was going to win

443
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
F****** insane

444
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
The re-election

445
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
Dino dino game

446
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,296
2024 presidential election

447
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
It's over

448
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,672
I I try to imagine myself

449
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
In a younger time

450
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Like

451
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
I don't know

452
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
10 fifteen years ago

453
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
Experiencing some of this stuff

454
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
Now this is Becky

455
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Uptime

456
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Hyper tough time putting

457
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
These events

458
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
In two other periods of time

459
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah I mean yeah

460
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
SMS

461
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
Yo Russians losing in Ukraine now

462
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah and Alex's know this week

463
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Okay

464
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,648
And there's a new story as having once been going on

465
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
We also have

466
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
So out of control

467
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Ukraine dragon

468
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Washington Farms

469
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Didn't survive an assassination attempt

470
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
Russian generals

471
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,968
And a bunch of other Russian leaders

472
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Mobile

473
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm shooting him strangling I'm poisoning them

474
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
We are

475
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
I'm sorry what

476
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
With weapons

477
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
Yes directions to put up a big fight

478
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
But they're losing

479
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Hardline

480
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Now see this sounds like a guy who's

481
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Questioning

482
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
Wow seems like a guy who's just got questions

483
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Not a guy who's

484
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,304
Saying. That's why I'm making a statement

485
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,680
The assassination attempt on Putin 12 rumors that are going around

486
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Confirm

487
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
Stop it Alex is taking it is very serious and very real

488
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,360
I bet it probably had to do with like

489
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,992
Slow-acting sedatives that they were putting in Putin's Diet Coke polonium

490
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
Any number of different

491
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Bad it is

492
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
It is

493
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
We should feel bad

494
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
We should feel bad for her

495
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,512
For Russia cuz they're under attack by the globalist

496
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,352
That's why we feel bad well yeah I mean

497
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
This is just the either way that

498
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Alex has decided for today to argue that

499
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Rush's

500
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
Dresser

501
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
The country

502
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Fun

503
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,504
So we get the covid-19 weenie the sound effect for that or something

504
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
They were never going to do that but

505
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
The British medical journal

506
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,024
Came out yesterday we have the article right here

507
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
And said okay we think it came out of the lab

508
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Virus

509
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
Artificial

510
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
It's a match

511
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
You believe this

512
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,080
That the British medical journal has suddenly taken a huge about-face

513
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152
Way long after it would make any sense and said that the

514
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,504
Covid-19 came from a lab at specifically probably one in China

515
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
No I don't believe that good insta

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
This isn't even about the British medical journal

517
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,952
Published in the Lancet

518
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Oh okay

519
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,792
Put together a commission to identify lessons

520
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,400
It's for the future that we can learn from covid and they didn't find that it came from a lab

521
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,704
Premier key finding section

522
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,544
The proximal origins of SARS Cove to remain unknown

523
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Their two leading hypothesis

524
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,992
That the virus emerged as a zoonotic spillover from Wildlife or farm animal possibly through wet Market in Aloha

525
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
Location that is still undetermined

526
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Or the virus emerged from a research related incident during the field collection of viruses or through a laboratory

527
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Associated

528
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,072
Commissioners held diverse views about the relative probabilities of the two explanations

529
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
And both possibilities require further scientific

530
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Investigation

531
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
So that's what Alex is reported

532
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
It is

533
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
People who like to say

534
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Definitive things

535
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Do not like

536
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
To read what scientist actual

537
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
Sounds like Alex is questioning thing

538
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Yeah I know he's questioning

539
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
Iraq

540
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,696
Findings NES The Source wrong because he doesn't know what he's talking about it all and just making s*** up as it goes along

541
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
He sucks liar

542
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
That was bad that was pretty egregious though to be like we already knew it was made up whenever it it's not free

543
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
From the medical journal

544
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
And it doesn't even

545
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Man

546
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Yeah little

547
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Young Dolph

548
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,360
So what Alex has a gas that's not this Doctor Who Wants

549
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
To get everyone sick

550
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
It is a guy

551
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
Let me see if I can give you a clue that won't give it away

552
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
He sells pillows

553
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
There was too much of a clue

554
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
Too good of a clue you know I don't remember I don't know who invented the assertive that they didn't ask

555
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,864
Invented the memory foam he didn't even invent any pillow

556
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Power 85

557
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Mustache

558
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Michael del zotto

559
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,360
Alright two days ago is on a hunting trip early in the morning stopped in to get

560
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Hardee's in

561
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Surrounding

562
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
Fullbacks toriel recap

563
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
News now

564
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Investigating election fraud

565
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:47,232
That's always news then finding stolen voting machines look at it

566
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
I guess he was across the border

567
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
NBA

568
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
No I think that's

569
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
That stuff that was stolen from

570
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Machines

571
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Investigated

572
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
Mike lindell's Associates are very likely going to go to prison

573
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
Well see

574
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
That is where we get

575
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,136
Into an issue here

576
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Because they're talking about fake things

577
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Right well I mean what's fun about that is

578
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,816
That is in a backdoor way

579
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
Will force them to investigate the voting machines

580
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
Will finally look into your b*******

581
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
So we can prove

582
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,056
Europe time Commander

583
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
You know there is an argument to be made that technology has gotten too out of hand and do you know

584
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
Takes away the ability for people to vote

585
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Real

586
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Assurance in their voting

587
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Which is why I think we need to go back to

588
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
The broken pieces of pottery I think I used to devote

589
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
No other system is accepted

590
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
I would go with

591
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
Dog food

592
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Okay

593
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
What's the

594
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
Prettiest person that we can find

595
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Haunted house that a vote

596
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
What was yours about

597
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Oh okay

598
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Mike

599
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
I don't even know how to

600
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Save this

601
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
700 episodes account

602
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
710 into a fella

603
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
And Mike has been

604
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Defrauded by

605
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Anyone into another question

606
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
When did you first meet Tina Peters

607
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,384
At the Cyber Symposium you guys already know that

608
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
He's talking about the SBI asking

609
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
I said

610
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Call Aurora country

611
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Cyber experts

612
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
And people are

613
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
People from around the

614
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,440
Politician stop and then I said

615
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
I said oh you must be trying out the

616
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
The dentist Montgomery terabytes that I own now

617
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Which is sitting by the way everybody

618
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
In Nevada

619
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
But the government has a

620
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
32 terabytes of the whole election

621
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
November 3rd November 6th

622
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
That's what I think they're afraid of

623
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
They're not

624
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
Things to do with that is Montgomery

625
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
S*** that brings it

626
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
It's sucking guy

627
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,184
That's a real full circle moment

628
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
Good at this

629
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,536
Yeah it's so good it's scamming these these

630
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
Money marks on the right

631
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
It's it's outrageous

632
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,216
He's got it he's got an Mo yeah and it's not like it's hard

633
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
How do you not just talked to somebody else who has been scammed by Dennis Montgomery and be like oh okay nevermind

634
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Is Joe Arpaio not in Market Mike lindell's

635
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,576
Giving them one by one and their friends

636
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Ya couldn't

637
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Alex warned him

638
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:01,280
Alex's had run into a break maybe they're just too embarrassed to admit that they got scam so they're like old man

639
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,120
Oops you're in there with I think a lot of them

640
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
Probably our I think it might be right

641
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Talking about it is

642
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,568
Mike's willingness to say this came from Dennis Montgomery

643
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,432
No he doesn't know he doesn't know that that name is something that like

644
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Alright alright

645
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,296
It's something that gives you a like oh your arguments dumb

646
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,368
There's nothing here you have invalidated your Old Point

647
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,952
By bringing a noted career con man

648
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
I need the fraud the government

649
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,144
Certainly the government and people of stuff

650
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Yeah I'm just knows who to pick to fry

651
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
IFit butt look

652
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Pastner

653
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
In the present I don't think it takes much

654
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,200
Skill to notice that Mike Lindell is gullible as a lot of money

655
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
He's alright

656
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
That is it

657
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,600
Conman to walk by Mike Lindell without trying to

658
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
Steal something

659
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Must require superhuman

660
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
You got to give up your time card

661
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Got to try and caught about himself

662
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
That guy you can watch

663
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
You didn't scam like lundell

664
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,824
Ivory concept meeting at the American Legion

665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
So

666
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,688
I I just I can't have any conclusion other than like

667
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
Dennis Montgomery got Mike bad he got him hard

668
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,672
Finally my body is more Americana than you and you're the Great American we love you and are persecuting all of us together

669
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
They are scared

670
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,776
Well they weren't there very worried everybody and I want everybody to

671
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,872
Montgomery's terabytes

672
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
For the last

673
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Deer and a half and there's a reason

674
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Symposium

675
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784
But we were advised not to

676
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
I'll put up a

677
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
Don't try nothing and Alba

678
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,744
Symposium was that what everybody at the moment of truth Summit

679
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,072
Right onstage we had the attorney out there

680
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
And he told you why we could not drop them

681
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,728
Because I think it is there's something so f******

682
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,056
Funny about this being her Moment of Truth Summit

683
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
At the last minute we're like literally could not be

684
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
More names

685
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
So ironic

686
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Sing

687
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
I mean yeah

688
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah

689
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
The public

690
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,232
There's a government gag order on this information

691
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
I don't believe that

692
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
.

693
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
There's now I own all this stuff

694
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
And I bought the

695
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
The different stuff

696
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
One of the smartest man I've ever known by the way

697
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Oh

698
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Just so sad

699
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
So sad

700
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,296
There never is always is a gag order with Dennis Montgomery's stuff

701
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,856
Because it's made of tomato pretend nonsense

702
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
I believe

703
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Mike Lindell

704
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Probably

705
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Quite a bit of money for

706
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,816
It's about incident real information that is

707
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Amazing

708
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Not good

709
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
We're not related

710
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
Or made up

711
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Wow

712
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,568
If you weren't such a piece of s*** and the information wasn't used so negatively

713
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:31,200
I mean I wish I had the front of this many right-wing propaganda

714
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
That's an accomplishment

715
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,808
Tremont that I do respect

716
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,136
I think more people should screw these guys out of their money

717
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Because they're dumb

718
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
It is just something that is so weird

719
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
2 event

720
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
He is

721
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
This thing that key

722
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
Keeps coming up

723
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
You know

724
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,680
That you would not expect that this con man would just

725
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:57,312
Run through so many we haven't even talked about him and

726
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Forever

727
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
News from Friday

728
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah

729
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Crazy

730
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,784
Oh man I felt like somebody was saying that he was

731
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Is dead

732
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
Recently I don't know I kind of thought he was dead the first time we talked about having no

733
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Investigate

734

Nice

739
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
So he got Mike lundell

740
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,688
Got him hard

741
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Pool

742
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
We need to have like a ton team version of I think it'll be someone we're not aware of yet

743
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
The prominence I don't know

744
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
I don't know once I hear Tucker

745
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
Say those two magic Tucker

746
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
Montgomery

747
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Or you can go to Janice Montgomery

748
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
You work for the government

749
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,776
He made this thing called Hammer scorecard for the government

750
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
Patriot just still Lex

751
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,944
It's going to spy on other elections around the world

752
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Turn this on her own people

753
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
The government doesn't want you to see this everybody

754
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
And that government

755
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm shutting down there if that judge releases this to the public

756
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
If they release this to the public gets over everybody

757
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
They're definitely scared of you

758
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,336
Viewers Michael Alex Jones our own a symbiotic

759
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Defense

760
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
You better big sponsor people can go to

761
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Big sides

762
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,232
American companies

763
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
Tell people

764
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
How to check out for savings

765
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
She can also sponsor us really appreciate it

766
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
Your new website as well

767
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
It really feels like these two dudes are playing different game doesn't realize that

768
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
Memories of long-term con man who's been part of at least

769
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,760
A few of Alex's busted narratives in the past and Alex knows not to take that s*** seriously

770
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,088
Because of that or just because he's out of his mind

771
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,392
Lindale seems like he actually believe

772
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
If this information gets out

773
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah it's going to have a huge political effect

774
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
Conversely Alex just want to bike

775
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,656
Money and he knows that the only way to get it is to allow him to say whatever he wants on there

776
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
Still taking this Montgomery should seriously or else you'd be insisting that this is the biggest story in the world may be covering it wall-to-wall

777
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,176
Blase nonsense that you hand wave way to get your promo code

778
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Promotion

779
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,504
Mike Lindell is that guy that

780
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
That you just got up like

781
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,136
I don't he has too much hubris or something because like anybody

782
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Coup

783
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Who is a right-wing propaganda

784
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Is worth a damn

785
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Yeah we're just be like

786
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Shut up

787
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
Shut up don't say anything

788
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,216
Just give me money let me put your message out your doing this poorly

789
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,336
If you want his money you have to let him talk

790
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
He reveals

791
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
That he's working on information

792
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
A bed is Montgomery

793
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
And the whole thing pasta

794
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Yeah

795
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,832
Do you need an intermediary bird-like is his message but

796
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Asaka defunded intermedia

797
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
Right right

798
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
He wants

799
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Ape s*** crazy

800
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,304
And he is going to pay out the wazoo.

801
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
To get a check crazy now at the same time and that's what you are

802
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
I don't think the

803
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,216
He recognizes it takes you crazy

804
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,848
I mean you I hate it whenever I hear him talk because if he was

805
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Yelling about like

806
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
The f******

807
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
Betting lines for

808
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,320
Football on Sundays on ESPN or something

809
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:58,464
I think that could work his voice is right for it like Blues / 3

810
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
Brick-and-mortar building

811
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
That works for me

812
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
But this is sad this is a terrified man

813
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:11,520
An Alex Billington Stampy's let his Montgomery. But are that's why Alex is like

814
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,848
I better f****** get some pillow money

815
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
Yeah alright well as what gates are open

816
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:22,016
You're given Montgomery money going to give me some too damn

817
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Yeah I'm going to have

818
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
To go ahead and save that ethically speaking Alex is piggybacking on Dennis Montgomery's defrauding of Mike Lindell

819
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
I don't know when the Montgomery information

820
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
Started to be part of lindell's thing

821
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
So

822
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
Alex might have been calling him before

823
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Who knows

824
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
What the first con begin

825
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
We were so young

826
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Alex gets back talking about bees

827
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
Immigrants coming to Martha's Vineyard

828
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
And he's a liar

829
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
Boston little kids have been kidnapped

830
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
Men

831
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
To all these different places

832
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,584
Illegally

833
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
We're going to put them on my assistant say hey

834
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,936
Going to South Side Chicago or south

835
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
Places like South Dallas in South Chicago

836
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
You are going

837
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
In the Bronx

838
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
You're not going to d.c.

839
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
You are

840
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
Going to Martha's Vineyard where you're going

841
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Kamala Harris house

842
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
It seems like he's

843
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,696
Totally fine with human trafficking as long as its adult men

844
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Cool man

845
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
To know and it's not

846
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
Yeah there were children's at the Martha's Vineyard

847
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
According to reporting available at the time Alex is on are the group included quotes seven families with four children

848
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
From 3 to 8 years old

849
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,407
I was just lying to his audience because he knows that the reality of what the scientists did looks really really bad

850
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,711
Transporting it would be interesting contradiction

851
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
With his imaginary principles

852
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:02,623
So in order to you know you don't have to choose between being a coward or haven't

853
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,719
Instead you just create a false reality to respond to

854
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,839
He's really lucky that none of his listeners really even care about what's true or not oh s*** that's

855
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
Also the migrants are told they're going to boss

856
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,543
On every level this is a fraud being perpetuated at the expense of vulnerable people in order to score political points

857
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
I mean

858
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
Do you also in danger

859
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Don't like

860
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
It's outrageous

861
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
Yeah

862
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
I just

863
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
And to be a dick to say

864
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,695
After we just like well at least they weren't trafficking children you know like the Democrats do and it's like no they were

865
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
And then he said

866
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
Which they were smart not to do and you're like well

867
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
They would be if they hadn't

868
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
What they did

869
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,703
That's why I'm saying that how Alex is freezing

870
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,311
He is accepting that this is trafficking children

871
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Be human trafficking children

872
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
So they are human trafficking

873
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
According to Alex

874
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
But instead of that

875
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,551
He's just going to say that the Democrats are human traffickers

876
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
And they are smart for end that

877
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Will you deny that the thing happened

878
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
People who did it

879
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
I didn't do it

880
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Yeah yeah yeah

881
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,327
Yeah I did that really is that really is going to drive me insane

882
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
It really is going to drive me

883
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Brian

884
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
With Alex talking about cars

885
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,079
Horsepower of a Mustang pretty good

886
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
College

887
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
Thousand

888
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
Horsepower

889
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
With twin

890
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Superchargers

891
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
0 to 60

892
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
Dangerous

893
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
200 miles an hour

894
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
That's black

895
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
Press down accelerator

896
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
What

897
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
1 a.m.

898
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Is that political

899
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
In the arena

900
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
And we are

901
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Alive

902
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
And being alive means

903
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
You know you're going to die

904
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,143
Being alive means wasting a full minute talking about nothing

905
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,519
You like you know Lewis Hamilton is the greatest Grand Prix driver the history of the sport

906
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
Liberals don't drive that

907
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,247
The best ever at driving so fast it still drives fast they don't understand what it means to me

908
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
July

909
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
At the fastest

910
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,391
Right and I think there's something that's being

911
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Expressway hours

912
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,975
Tubi

913
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
Don't drive fast

914
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
Because they don't want it

915
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,375
Experience the danger of driving fast

916
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
And the danger of driving

917
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
Fast he's knowing that you

918
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,311
Who died right just the only way to really be alive

919
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,359
This is silly.

920
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:09,759
Insane want to talk about cars a little bit

921
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,575
Didn't seem like he was just bragging about his car

922
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Like

923
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
Man they just said they want to try and own just that

924
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
Anything that comes into their

925
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
Fear

926
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
It feels like vaguely mascara

927
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
Yeah

928
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,703
Yeah which is like man driving fast is not masculine or feminine

929
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,287
It's a playing with the toy everybody like playing with toys

930
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
It's playing with toys

931
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
I don't particularly like driving much

932
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
No but you like playing with your toys

933
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
You like your choice yeah you got bud

934
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,135
I have video games either

935
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
No not really

936
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,279
No that's true I haven't since I've lived in Chicago I was just such a bad driver

937
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,095
I got bored really easily

938
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:01,215
I don't think I have ADD but like when I was driving it was so boring

939
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,775
Right they'll write every now and again I would hit

940
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
The curb

941
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
But not like

942
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
It's not like highway hypnosis or anything anymore

943
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Imany I may end up having to get a license

944
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,391
Begin at some point just want to live in the middle of nowhere without a

945
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
Without a car that'll be tough

946
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
How to be tougher

947
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Not if I got

948
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Drone

949
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
Noah's thinking more along the lines of

950
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
You know an assassin

951
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:35,007
Creed Valhalla you get that ride around

952
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
I don't think I need the lights right above felines in this area

953
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
So

954
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
Viewer discretion advised

955
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
To this nightclub

956
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,391
Terrible or anything it's just Alex is talking a little bit about sex so great and this is a family show

957
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
And a few times thanks for telling us

958
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Incredible woman

959
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
After you get out of here

960
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
I'm sorry

961
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
I don't want to punch you in the face

962
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
I want to beat you with a bullwhip

963
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
The point is I'm not into pain baby

964
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,767
I think I just kept it in cuz I'm not into

965
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,119
Is that what we say for the

966
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Save that

967
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
That's our covid conspiracy of the day

968
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
I'm not into pain baby

969
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
I think

970
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
I think

971
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,359
But Alex is also mixing up a fair amount of BDSM

972
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
Here in terms of their

973
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,223
You know obviously there are some people who like a little bit of rough

974
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
Stuff

975
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
It's not the entirety of

976
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Of bondage

977
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,159
He has a full

978
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Understanding this but

979
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,791
It might I'm not sure that I believe his childhood stories now

980
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Barriers

981
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
I'm terrible with knots

982
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,959
I'm terrible with nuts I did tried to watch a video one time I was asking but I was asked

983
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
About how to tighten some good knots for the stuff

984
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
You know the type

985
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Sure not good at it

986
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
Real bad got out

987
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
That's that the real disappointing hostage situation one which is a fantasy and you still let the hostage

988
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:28,159
Well what time what time is young lady who wanted me to bring some.

989
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,719
Set the bedroom

990
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
Big mistake

991
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:50,431
I do appreciate that 700 episode took 700 episodes for me to really want

992
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
Now you know how I feel the time

993
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Medford

994
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
For slightly different reasons

995
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
Alex has a story

996
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:06,047
We heard this tale of a football player who had a lot of blood clot

997
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,399
I know Alex has a story about someone having a hard time

998
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
We have tens of thousands of percent increase

999
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
People having heart attacks

1000
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
Has your heart

1001
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
What is the tree of death

1002
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,887
Cross country

1003
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
EG earnest

1004
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,567
A seventeen-year-old Bartlett High School cross country Runners recovery in Florida

1005
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
After undergoing emergency heart surgery

1006
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,223
I just completed

1007
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
When he started complaining

1008
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Of chest pains

1009
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,415
Barry G's Melissa Moon reports he underwent a 3-hour surgery and now teammate

1010
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,719
Community or praying for a Swift

1011
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Return

1012
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
To help

1013
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,607
I consulted tons of news stories about this case and none of them say he gotten vaccinated

1014
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,703
That's just an assumption that Alex is making which you may notice is a trend

1015
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Ddreports

1016
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Hyping up

1017
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,079
Instances of young people having medical conditions but never actually does the works

1018
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
To connect them to the vaccine

1019
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Seen it all

1020
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,199
That connection is already made in the minds of his listeners so it's kind of a waste

1021
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
The time to worry about actually damage

1022
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
What's trading at

1023
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,623
It seems like this never happens or can't happen but high school athletes

1024
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Can have heart attack

1025
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
Just do a little digging into the subject

1026
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,279
You can find instances pre covid really easily

1027
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
Impact in 2011 Denver public schools began installing portable defibrillator is that schools because quote

1028
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,775
Sudden Cardiac Arrest killed an estimated 300,000 Americans over here

1029
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
Including about 7,000

1030
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Some children

1031
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,359
Alex is a

1032
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:00,479
Exploiting is audiences understandable feeling that young people shouldn't have heart attacks

1033
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,295
And then weaponizing that buries anti-vax agenda

1034
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:08,415
It's disgusting and ultimately he's using the deaths in medical emergencies of these young people as props

1035
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,719
For him to use to accumulate power and profit

1036
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,791
Sort of like how Ron DeSantis is using

1037
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
Please wait

1038
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
You're connecting these two things

1039
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,167
Brothers pneumatic similarities

1040
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,055
Where Alex just assumes he never does any of the work that you need to do to actually reported stories just guessing

1041
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Some s***

1042
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
But notice the adults all have Stockholm

1043
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Call syndrome

1044
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
We're just looking for something weird we don't know what caused this

1045
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
Well we know what caused it

1046
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
You bet your bottom dollar

1047
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Moderna

1048
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Knj

1049
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Shot

1050
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
And so

1051
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,999
Any of them are all three

1052
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
You know the bug did it

1053
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,631
Apologist

1054
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
The know

1055
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
I don't need to be

1056
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
The shot

1057
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
So who's thinking is just stupid

1058
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:12,927
And assuming that you know and can just guess causal relations between things without knowing more about the variables that

1059
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
Painfully dumb

1060
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
Like for instance what if you get bit by two things

1061
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Which caused the reaction you're seeing

1062
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,423
No no no no what is your composting variable complicating

1063
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,055
Also you can clearly see here that Alex is just guessing that the runner in this case got the vaccine

1064
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Even if he had

1065
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
Alex can't prove or demonstrate any calls a link but

1066
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,735
Alex can't even prove that the thing he's claiming cause this

1067
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
Perfect even happened

1068
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
He's seen it affect

1069
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
That he knows he can exploit

1070
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,927
So he's decided what the cause is based on no information

1071
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:49,535
This isn't the story that's going to be followed up on so if you're in the audience

1072
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,607
You'll just experience the story of the dopamine rush if Alex

1073
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
Proving your anti-vax ideas correct

1074
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,263
Never even worrying about whether or not you were just the target of a parlor

1075
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
But he's just questioning

1076
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
Really I mean when you think about it Alex

1077
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Question thing

1078
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Thanks not make things up

1079
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:11,551
He really is a cult leader in this respect because you could absolutely see him like

1080
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
With his

1081
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,135
His loyal info Warriors walking down

1082
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,207
Street and pass by a guy with a broken arm and also be like

1083
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
Haha it was a snake bite

1084
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
Nunda just keep walking

1085
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,071
That was a snakebite clearly

1086
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
Like there's there's nothing it doesn't matter if it

1087
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
Even make sense

1088
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,495
Yeah that's what he's is descriptions like

1089
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,103
Well if you get bit by rattlesnake in your leg does a thing then you know that it's a rattlesnake

1090
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
Well then you have to say that he got the vaccine

1091
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
And then the thing happen

1092
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
Right this is like thing is like

1093
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,135
Swole up clearly it was a rattlesnake like no that doesn't have anyone proven that there is a rattlesnake

1094
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,207
We don't have we don't have a rattlesnake

1095
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
ITube

1096
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
Snake in this situation

1097
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,447
Interviewing that Paul Alexander

1098
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Give a f***

1099
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
So we're going to jump

1100
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
Do

1101
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
16th Friday show

1102
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Wolf

No man's land

1104
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Nothing happen

But the live show headliners

1106
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,343
This is an emergency

1107
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,927
Emergency

1108
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
Even mitigate

1109
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
How bad

1110
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
This crash

1111
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047

1112

So you go to infowars.com she's alive show

1113
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399

It says emergency

1115
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215

Absolutely

1119
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Key indicator

1120
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
Not just here but in the world economy

1121
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
FedEx

1122
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
The world but I told you in the last month

1123
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Because I know

1124
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
People in

1125
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
A lot of areas of infrastructure

1126
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
Basically

1127
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
The

1128
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
Economy is Flatline

1129
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,879
This is all been done by Design

1130
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
As usual

1131
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
Here are some of the headlines

1132
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,815
FedEx shares Plunge

1133
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Dow Jones indices waiting on right now

1134
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
FedEx shares Plunge

1135
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
By 70%

1136
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
Company says it's going

1137
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
To get worse

1138
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,895
We're going into a worldwide recession FedEx CEO warrants

1139
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Numbers don't pretend

1140
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Very well

1141
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,855
So there's some serious concerns with FedEx announcing that they're seeing the decrease in shipping both domestically and internationally

1142
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:59,743
This could be a negative indicator for the economy and the future but there's also a ton of other variables to play into the

1143
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,607
One that pointed to pretty frequently is that the Asian economy is weakening

1144
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,655
And that impacted showing introduced

1145
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Freight

1146
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
Another variable is that people are starting

1147
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,311
The shop in person more now that most people are acting like covid is over

1148
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,151
That is the effect of reducing shipping to previously normal rate

1149
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
Which are lower than they have been over the course of the pandemic

1150
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,015
Thirdly Amazon is made Moves

1151
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:26,111
Listen to be Logistics and transport or Transportation space in the past few years

1152
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,415
And that has had the effect of reducing FedEx's

1153
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
Is overall market share

1154
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
All that being said FedEx was down about

1155
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
22%

1156
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,071
Which definitely isn't a good

1157
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
However if you look back at their stock price over time they're trading at about $161 a share as I was

1158
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Preparing this episode

1159
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
In March 2020

1160
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,383
106 dollars and sixty-three cents a share

1161
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,223
Before making a huge jump as the pandemic led to more people ordering

1162
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
Things for more delivery

1163
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
A people ordering things that

1164
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,415
Maybe needed to be delivered immediately

1165
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Time frame

1166
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
Which does have

1167
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,583
Demand goes down you still need to offer that delivery

1168
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,399
In that window that you're offering right

1169
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Which leads to like

1170
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
Can save a plane being a hundred percent full you have to send it with like

1171
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Half full

1172
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:23,199
This may be a bad indicator of things to come but it may not be a cause for an emerging

1173
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Episode

1174
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
The theatrics but Alex is putting

1175
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:32,927
That said he does this all the time about everything and it's always the summer of Rage coming and I'm not

1176
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
Not surprised at all

1177
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,839
Yeah girl there may be economic issues there may be some difficulties

1178
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,887
FedEx might be in some trouble

1179
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,495
But whatever it is has nothing to do with it is no connection to anything Alex the same

1180
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
I mean if we live in America if you look at us historically the fact that they don't reckon that we don't regulate

1181
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
The finance industry whatsoever

1182
00:57:55,455 --> 00:58:00,063
As essentially led to a series of crashes that happened every decade 22-dec

1183
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Happens every f****** time

1184
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Where do

1185
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
Ridge cumming

1186
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
Oh boy

1187
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
Great prophet

1188
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,047
So what's Primacy and review

1189
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Not really real

1190
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,215
We have more people assigned to investigate white supremacy

1191
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Actual white supremacist in the United States

1192
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Almost not exist

1193
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,247
Italian all this

1194
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
Try out other political opposition

1195
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Next hour

1196
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
I'm just going to say this now

1197
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
Broadcast

1198
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
Opportunity

1199
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,935

I'm not going to bet you complain

1203
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,783
We put everything we had into buying this product

1204
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
Tells you what I told you a month ago

1205
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
Flatline so I know people run out of money

1206
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
But you must

1207
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,423
Absolutely look in your life

1208
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
And decide

1209
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
What is most critical

1210
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
What are generous person Alex's

1211
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,383
Given the audience an opportunity to give him money

1212
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,455
That's the kind of selfless character you rarely see these days

1213
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,503
Going out of his way of being like

1214
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Hey

1215
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
I know you're hurting

1216
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,111
But it's important to still give me money

1217
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Need money

1218
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
What an opportunity for you

1219
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
Just I just

1220
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,351
Man if you actually admitted if you really believe that

1221
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
People are struggling

1222
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,215
And you ask them for money after you agree with that

1223
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
That's crazy

1224
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:59,615
That's bananas down to me to look at somebody who is struggling more than me and then be like

1225
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
But

1226
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,295
You should give me money that's crazy because whatever I'm doing my project is more important than your well-being

1227
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
I would give you money

1228
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,743
That's just an idea I don't understand how you're struggling and I'm not so then you I can help you not struggle

1229
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
What's it that complicated

1230
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,303
Because he's a good guy

1231
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Understand

1232
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,143
So Alex plays a long B

1233
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
Of Josh Hawley

1234
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Interviewing

1235
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
Someone from Facebook

1236
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
And just

1237
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
Someone from

1238
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,359
From the company yeah yeah yeah

1239
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
Not just like

1240
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Okay

1241
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
End

1242
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
And

1243
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Boring

1244
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Yeah I think this

1245
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,343
Highlights of boring it is cuz I'll accept

1246
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Start yelling

1247
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,159
We do know that people

1248
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Started and hoped

1249
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,207
From the

1250
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,023
That we would help them get accurate information about

1251
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Covid during the unpress

1252
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
Especially

1253
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Isn't there a

1254
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,655
Prince between use app

1255
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,727
Form putting forward information and censoring

1256
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
Your users

1257
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
The best of

1258
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,055
The White House

1259
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
The

1260
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,639
Administration were broadly in the CDC

1261
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Is there distinction

1262
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
We specifically

1263
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
Wanted to work with

1264
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Health experts

1265
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
To understand the relationship

1266
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Between information and behavior

1267
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,671
Until we did Consultants

1268
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
Buy them

1269
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
Collusion

1270
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
What is weed

1271
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
You didn't just

1272
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,887
Consultant understand how they

1273
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
The public house if you actually

1274
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
Censored on their behalf

1275
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
Yeah it's it's

1276
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Whatever

1277
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
To indicate there's a long stretch

1278
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:41,503
Of that being the coverage and I can't even keep it together

1279
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Just watch it

1280
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,599
No he's not he's not cut out for I would

1281
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
Would say like analysis of

1282
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Dense

1283
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
Like more boring

1284
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
Rang frere

1285
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
You know that's kind of his bread and butter

1286
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,167
I think it'll be fun if you had

1287
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
If I was running Infowars

1288
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,751
I would have a little m

1289
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:08,127
That is like Alex's tolerance meter that would edit edit would like have a little graphic where is Hedwig

1290
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Would start to pop

1291
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Cuz that's what

1292
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:16,319
It feels like when he's watching that at there's just the m going m

1293
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,903
Bad influences and you don't know what they're going

1294
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,511
Space on screen it just automatically blows up

1295
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,351
For some reason you bring a llama in studio and everything's fine

1296
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
It's just fine

1297
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
If I would be more frustrated with the

1298
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
Studio

1299
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,823
That's what I cuz it's my apartment

1300
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Like llamas

1301
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
But not my apartment

1302
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
With the big nose

1303
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
WhatsApp

1304
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
Something that's not true

1305
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:58,559
Flooring class Rob is the head of the UN and said he has full command

1306
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
Yeah

1307
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,703
Carswap was sworn in as the head of the UN

1308
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
Don't they have to have like a whole thing

1309
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:13,151
Alex's just questioning text don't you understand

1310
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
Sordid and Secret

1311
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
Why would you have

1312
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,063
Eddie swearing-in ceremony if you can do it in secret

1313
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
I don't know

1314
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Didn't happen

1315
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,839
Yeah that's it that's an issue I was looking around I can't even figure out what he might be referring to as misreporting

1316
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
I have no idea

1317
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
What

1318
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
Where where when and why doesn't explain

1319
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
Bulshit okay

1320
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
So look Alex likes to talk about memes and stuff and he saw video on social media that got a report on

1321
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,135
I want to play Annie mom here somebody gets muzzle to General

1322
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,439
That's not true

1323
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
We talked about Tik-Tok

1324
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,383
Destroying messages to kill the family and a Kill

1325
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
Minds and our future

1326
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:22,783
In the very same algorithm in China

1327
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
Puts out a different message

1328
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Estella

1329
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
Military

1330
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
Is mathematics

1331
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,047
So while they're building men and women and Families

1332
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:45,311
They found the video that Alex was referring to but I don't know who the

1333
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:50,431
The person is who's talking and I have no idea there even an Imam or anything

1334
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,479
It's just someone who kind of looks

1335
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,879
It's like they're in the attire you might think any mom would be in but outside of that there's no indication but his identity at all

1336
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,999
I found the person who originally posted this on Twitter but there's no citation to who the person is

1337
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,071
I have no one in the comments identifies him either

1338
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
It's baffling

1339
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,655
I have no idea who the person is in larger point

1340
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Neither does our

1341
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:16,799
You just all random video on social media that made a point that he liked about Tik-Tok so he's reporting

1342
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
It's a process

1343
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
That's what you doing

1344
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,431
Death even leaving the anonymity of the speaker aside

1345
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,223
Who cares about this claim

1346
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:29,855
It's not backed up by any data that this guy is presenting it's just a thing that someone saying someone who

1347
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:33,439
No idea who they are or the larger context of their combat

1348
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,767
Essentially what I'm saying here is that I don't really care about this video

1349
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,071
The only important thing to point out is that

1350
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,119
Alex has no idea who this person is

1351
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,959
There's nothing backing up what they're saying and he's he loves

1352
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,311
Alex's broadcast has become an audio version of

1353
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Uncle's Facebook page

1354
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
2015

1355
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,783
Like it is just a series of like maybe I'm an idiot

1356
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,367
But yeah it looks like a bunch of

1357
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,183
I saw this and now I'm mad and then you just move on

1358
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,767
Flamewar in the comments for a while

1359
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
And then the next day you're like I saw that

1360
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
Looking awful right

1361
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
And

1362
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
Berries

1363
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
Just like the like

1364
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
The wave

1365
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
Is it social media

1366
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Makes things

1367
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Things like what

1368
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:26,175
The next post yet it's almost like a new cycle or right

1369
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,575
All those things that I said yesterday don't matter about alike since I got this

1370
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
From here so I got a

1371
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,135
Move on

1372
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
So

1373
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,767
Still talking a little bit about Martha's Vineyard here

1374
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,631
The difficult challenges are

1375
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
This is one of the leaders in Martha's Vineyard

1376
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,615
Believer

1377
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,407
What you're telling them come here

1378
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,711
Any voted 85% Martha's Vineyard

1379
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,503
4

1380
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,231
To be disconnected from reality sorry start over

1381
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
The difficult challenges are

1382
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,215
We have to fit some point in time to help

1383
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
We cannot

1384
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,335
We don't have two services

1385
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,895
Do take care of 50 immigrants

1386
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
Down and

1387
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:38,623
Island and everyone here that live

1388
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,951
50 more people

1389
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:48,607
Silence is presenting this is one of the leaders from Martha's Vineyard because he has no idea who this person is and he is not in

1390
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,935
Really sure if Martha's Vineyard has a city or what he should call their leader

1391
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:58,079
In reality this is Lisa belcastro the coordinator of the homeless shelter in Martha's Vineyard

1392
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:03,199
And when she says that eventually people need to leave she's talkin about how the shelter she works with

1393
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,503
Isn't designed for providing long-term health

1394
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,111
When you understand that what she's talking about is the services her shelter can provide

1395
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:15,487
Not like the city or the city

1396
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,047
He's he's deceiving with it

1397
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,327
Eye contacts

1398
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
So the larger context of that clip italics

1399
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
Even playing is about how the community has come together to help these migrant

1400
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,615
About how this is a disgraceful political stunt that's essentially an attack on the personhood

1401
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
Of these migrants themselves

1402
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,199
Conveniently cuts that off

1403
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
Adjust

1404
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,575
Is there is there's no other way to describe it then

1405
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
To save it

1406
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,183
He is taking these people and reduce them to

1407
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
That's what I like

1408
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
M2

1409
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Just a

1410
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,351
Cuz I like soda

1411
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
Reverse of this

1412
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
And all those

1413
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,471
People in DC and New York

1414
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
We're beating their chest

1415
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
Same day

1416
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,079
They were so proud to be

1417
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,871
The sanctuary jurisdiction

1418
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
Saying how bad

1419
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
It was they have it

1420
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
Your border

1421
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
The minutes

1422
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
Even a small

1423
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Fraction

1424
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
Of what does Bordertown

1425
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,111
Deal with everyday is brought to their front door

1426
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
They all of a sudden

1427
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
Go berserk

1428
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
In there so UPS

1429
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
This is happening

1430
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,999
And it just shows you

1431
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
You know their virtue signalling is

1432
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
Fraud

1433
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Okay

1434
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
They

1435
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,239
We can survive as a country if this is what elected leaders do

1436
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:36,639
The fabric of the country just won't hold together if we have trolls using humans for publicity stunts and a weirdo

1437
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
The lubes

1438
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,223
Do you reveal their virtue signaling

1439
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
Even if everything to Santos was saying was

1440
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
True

1441
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,623
This is how a distasteful prank show operates not a governor

1442
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
Beyond that what you saying is b*******

1443
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:52,511
People aren't upset about migrants and refugees going to different cities

1444
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:58,655
They were super offended by the way to Santa's is doing this as a political stunt using the safety of migrants as a prompt

1445
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
He's endangering human

1446
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,239
Including children for his own purposes

1447
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,543
Largely to increase the chances that he's able to

1448
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
Increases political power in

1449
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
In the future

1450
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,455
He knows well enough that he can't acknowledge that this is what he's getting pushed back for because

1451
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,783
Very sensible pushback that he can't just write off his

1452
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,831
Triggered virtue signal responses

1453
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,391
20% that's what people are upset about

1454
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695
Pleases the

1455
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,767
The aggressive audience

1456
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:26,815
I can't

1457
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
Hear him talk

1458
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Like that without

1459
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,679
Getting an immediate urge to like

1460
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,751
Bum rush the stage and just start slapping in the vet

1461
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
You can't

1462
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
Believer

1463
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,591
Yeah

1464
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,639
The biggest ginseng wake up

1465
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,271
Not possible for a human being to think

1466
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Is true

1467
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:52,671
Yep any meaningful for a person who has the responsibility for representing a fuk

1468
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
You're the governor of a state

1469
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
This is Ben

1470
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Yeah your station

1471
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,327
This is beneath your office

1472
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
I think a lot of things

1473
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,935
Maybe it's elected officials do our baby Ben

1474
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,751
Nephew off as well but particularly

1475
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Yeah.

1476
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,127
Acting this way to

1477
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
And then the response being like

1478
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
Oh look at this

1479
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,295
The Virtue signaling it reveals like that to me is like

1480
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
This is

1481
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
Social media trolling

1482
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
Just isn't this isn't

1483
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,463
Other Florida Governors do

1484
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
And

1485
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,023
Get rich off of your s***

1486
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
And then leave

1487
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,327
That's what is

1488
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:36,191
That's what the Professional Russian like Florida

1489
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,727
That's what they want

1490
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
God dammit

1491
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,663
So the third hour of Alex's show on Friday if he has a couple of doctors on who are suing about remdesivir

1492
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,735
Beer but they're clearly on a fishing Expedition

1493
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,039
They're making outrageous claims about hospitals

1494
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,111
Murdering for-profit but they are no evidence of anything

1495
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,695
They keep saying we hope will find things at Discovery

1496
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,231
Like 80

1497
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,791
In terms of like an interview it is a nothing

1498
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
But very excited

1499
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
Hopeful find things into

1500
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,727
We'll go from there

1501
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:16,127
I say I sue you and then you have to give me all the information that I need to sue you

1502
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,455
I make bold claims that are baseless and then

1503
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
MBA law

1504
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,295
So where will my score

1505
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,087
And it's about the lineage

1506
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111
Which of these

1507
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Sorts of

1508
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Publicity stunt

1509
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,207
And

1510
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
Probably start to happen

1511
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
There's one from Despicable Me

1512
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
Illegal migrants

1513
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
You're full

1514
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Reservation

1515
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,063
I mean Laurel

1516
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
Illegal alien

1517
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,183
Border to the California border

1518
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Pelosi's house

1519
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
And she got arrested for

1520
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Let's get Laura Loomer on Sunday

1521
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Very exciting about this book

1522
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Dan Weber.

1523
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Say that you won the election

1524
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Secretly

1525
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,495
So Alex is lying but what Laura Loomer did

1526
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:19,359
She picked up man she assumed for undocumented immigrants from a Home Depot parking lot

1527
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,943
And convince them to accompany her to set up a tent in Pelosi's back

1528
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,759
Pretty unlikely that they told

1529
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,039
Got that you told them that they

1530
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,855
Be trespassing on Pelosi's property to do so

1531
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:35,487
Almost certainly didn't tell them as part of a publicity stunt aimed at Boost

1532
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
Stinger profile

1533
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
With the Altima

1534
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,607
My goal of being to accumulate political power that you could wield against

1535
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,935
Immigrants it would be a very difficult thing to ask

1536
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,263
Explain in the Home Depot parking lot and Usos

1537
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
Successful

1538
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,847
It was pretty clear that the real aim of the stunts

1539
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,383
Was to do this

1540
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,479
Legal thing trespassing in order to create a confrontation between the police

1541
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
Ambient

1542
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,343
This would allow Willmar to do exactly what the scientist is doing now with the

1543
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,671
Do you want emigrants here but apparently not on your property

1544
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Kind of game

1545
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,255
Unfortunately Pelosi didn't press charges if

1546
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:12,863
The emigrants just left will summer at The Daily Beast quote

1547
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,983
When it became clear that the man wouldn't be arrested and deported as was apparently the plan

1548
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,335
What are Bloomers Associates ground and shouted catch-and-release at the FM

1549
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
The police

1550
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,943
Uber didn't get arrested for this. But again you can see this

1551
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Need to use

1552
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,015
Fraud to try and set people up

1553
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,343
And eagerness to use people as Pawns in politically cruel stunts

1554
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,391
That's Alex's ideology

1555
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,487
And this s*** is totally fine to him because they aren't people to him.

1556
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
These people are things

1557
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
Turn off Rob.

1558
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
You have

1559
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
To use fraud

1560
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,375
Because you are

1561
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,679
Complaining about people that don't

1562
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Exist

1563
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
So then you have to

1564
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
Because they're not going

1565
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
To do what it is you're complaining about

1566
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,823
Then you have to try and create

1567
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
A Contraption of sorts

1568
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:00,735
Let's try to get them into a situation where maybe what they do

1569
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,551
Could be construed from a distance as what

1570
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,879
You have been complaining about this whole time

1571
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:13,279
Contraptions Contraption Oklahoma

1572
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,631
It's like a it's like a chain reaction machine

1573
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
Yeah it is

1574
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
I think there is like a

1575
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
Able to make

1576
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,359
Connections

1577
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,711
Laura Loomer stunt is similar to this

1578
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,991
Anyways

1579
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
Yeah

1580
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:38,367
If you would sit and think about that for a little while

1581
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Maybe

1582
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Maybe you do

1583
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
If I was

1584
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:48,095
Who is DeSantis I would sit and think about that awhile and go am I really going to do Loomer s***

1585
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,375
Oh yeah

1586
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
That's what I would

1587
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,727
Yeah I'm a boomer hack

1588
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
And that's not because

1589
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,591
I mean in my in my inhabiting of this character

1590
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,895
It's not morally that loomer's

1591
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,199
Immoral things

1592
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
It's that

1593
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Sheesh it at the

1594
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
It's just

1595
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:13,439
Garbage performance art

1596
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
You know

1597
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
Like Marcel Duchamp put it upside down

1598
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
Urinal in Martha

1599
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Vineyard how about that

1600
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,423
Blow everybody's mind would be interesting it would be

1601
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,983
But you know what the Liberals of like that

1602
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:33,151
Would be confused by it a challenge

1603
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:38,527
Since everybody be wearing shirts and it be greedy and then the upside down urinal of Martha Martha

1604
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
Vineyard that's the way it would go

1605
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,391
So I mean look there's not much going on here

1606
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,231
As Alex's trial progresses

1607
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:51,583
We left off on Friday the end of pauses acrimony

1608
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,447
Norm was trying desperately to bring Trump into the proceedings

1609
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,287
And I got slapped down to that a number of time hilariously

1610
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,615
Yeah I don't know I don't think

1611
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
That's

1612
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,223
I don't know whether they're in a big points

1613
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,015
That you would want to bring up

1614
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,807
Over the course

1615
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
The week

1616
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
I mean

1617
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
I supposed to be

1618
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,671
Midpoints for me is just been

1619
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
So much

1620
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,767
Is it clearly especially with the elongated

1621
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Trial now

1622
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,119
Is so much of it is so obvious that the judge

1623
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
And

1624
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,471
Norman and Maddie and and all of those people

1625
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
Have the rules

1626
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,895
Setup and the rules are Norm cannot do everything that Norm is doing

1627
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,919
Yeah but

1628
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:42,271
Because it's a trial and we can't just sit there and have the judge say Norm

1629
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
Sit back down

1630
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:50,207
You are not allowed to talk so she has said that a couple times if you don't stop

1631
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,279
She's had to say that

1632
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,559
You keep saying that because

1633
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,095
That's their entire

1634
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,143
That's all they got is the stuff they can

1635
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,215
They don't have a new argument

1636
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,031
So they're just going to try and do different ways to like

1637
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:08,895
Back door the same s*** there not allowed to say in it for more weeks

1638
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Yeah

1639
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
So we'll give you an update on that

1640
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,599
As it goes along and the rules are broken

1641
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,695
Who's going to be there probably testifying next week or this week as a

1642
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
Is that things are going

1643
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
We'll see

1644
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
I'll be in touch

1645
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
