00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Alex Jones

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Hello sir

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,992
How do you do

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,184
If you were at a let's just call it like a regular party like one of those

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,560
Because you my friend

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
Have already been displayed and you are fat

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,472
Thank you very much

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
So you're talking about like maybe a gender reveal party

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Specifically

12
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,480
Baby shower baby shower

13
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
Mother-to-be

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
You don't know the gender yet

15
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
She asked

16
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
View

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
What should my fetus

18
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Eventually listen to

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
And could you describe whether or not or perhaps the relative knowledge of Alex Jones

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,592
Appropriate to your coming baby

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
The world will be long over I am so it is irrelevant

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
If your child

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
Is taken up by the aliens

24
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
Much like the children at the end of

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Nicolas Cage movies

26
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
What

27
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Nicolas Cage has been Nicolas Cage

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Movie 2012

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
Taking up by the aliens

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,824
Repopulate the new planet

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,040
The world is that it is

32
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Aliens come down

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
There's just a random out of the blue alien let me be clear

34
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
My phone is

35
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Mobile nearby

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,240
Your child is one of those children maybe there'll be archives at the alien

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
I have aboard the ship

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
I'm making listen back to what was happening in the culture

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Little about movie

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Is a torturous

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
Although

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
How to feel like

43
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
But also I'd like to thank

44
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
EXO

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920

46
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,272

And I thank you 200 looks like

48
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976

Say thank you so much for joining up with the team Destin

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728

Who came in at a little bit of very much Michael you are

53
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

54
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
You can go to our website

55
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,496
Appreciate it it means a lot and we're getting really

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
Dangerously close to the point where

57
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
I can literally

58
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
That's nice it's really appreciated that

59
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,040
I've got a lot of big work in the in the oven

60
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
Of things that everyone is going to really enjoy but it's very working

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Intensive anime

62
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Take a while

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Info baby is born

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Play I Don't Like

65
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
Any of the words that you just use very hungry

66
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,567
Baby coming out across the boards

67
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,015
So

68
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
It's called go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

69
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
A lot of folks sometimes

70
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Sometimes post memes

71
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Never a bad idea so delightful time

72
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
I was noticing a little bit of a trend

73
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
And that is a long time

74
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
2000

75
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm doing a bit of work

76
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
On digging into the beginning of a party of course

77
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
And then we introduced

78
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
Jim Bakker into our fold

79
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Revisit in the future

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
I found

81
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Including him in our show

82
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
Like that we are talking about him sounded amazing

83
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Episode

84
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
Place entirely at the general

85
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
I wish that there is General Store commercial actions

86
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
So

87
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
I admit and I accept the criticism covering the present

88
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
Alex Jones

89
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Also

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,447
That most of the stuff you saying it's stupid and distraction

91
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
It doesn't mean anything he's

92
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Just yelling Into The Ether

93
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
I don't want to cover it

94
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,479
If I watch it it makes for a boring show

95
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Anybody else

96
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,343
But I think that our skills and what we can bring to the table is not best used

97
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
In terms of like

98
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
Just doing an entire episode about him screaming about something

99
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
We have done a couple of those in the past when they have come up and Lord knows there

100
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Family fun

101
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
But ultimately it's so much candy

102
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,263
You know if there's no nutritional value to it and we're just what's going on

103
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,615
I'm just I'm just your spirit of giving people Health advice

104
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:46,015
While at the same time you're bringing out info babies right your China

105
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
I don't know

106
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
So I just

107
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
To cover a couple things that were not really going

108
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Talkin about

109
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
I'm sure you want to talk about

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Little bit the New York 14 race

111
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
IVF

112
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
You have any thoughts about that

113
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,223
Amazing she is doing everything right

114
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
She's got all the right position

115
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
And

116
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
The only the only observation you can take away from her

117
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
Brilliant and inspiring campaign

118
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Chicopee shook

119
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
She should just quit

120
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
Like the moment she won that right Nancy Pelosi should have been like oh I'm old

121
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
I forgot that I am eight million years older than Alexandria okay

122
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Amazing winning

123
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Harbinger things

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
To come but it is a super

125
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
Liberal District

126
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
So there's reasons why a lot of people

127
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Could under playset

128
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
And have a pretty

129
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
To do with it

130
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
Approached

131
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Primary campaign

132
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
Coming encroachment of communism

133
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
Which the Russians don't want anymore

134
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
Cuz of God or whatever

135
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
Play Everybody

136
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Number videos better

137
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
This is like going to bring about Civil War

138
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Define I'm cool with that so she is a Democratic Socialist

139
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
I believe in our group misunderstand this

140
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Fundamental piece of Alex's

141
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Cosmology so I feel like it might be

142
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
You're good

143
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Virginity to explain it

144
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
He's arguing with this

145
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
To Communism

146
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
So this is democratic

147
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
And the reason for that

148
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Come from none dare call it

149
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Conspiracy

150
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
The John Birch Society

151
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
Socialism that makes perfect cells for the people to lead into communism because you like

152
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
All this free stuff socialism and then

153
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
Before you know it it's communism which is really

154
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,631
Totalitarianism in Disguise and it's all run by corporate in

155
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
Which is a classic brought about

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,079
Especially in the thirties like immediately following the

157
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
We hate the Russians there communist

158
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,247
Realize that everybody's and

159
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
Railroad Barons are still a thing so we can't be having that how do we make it to that all this works out well

160
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Socialism

161
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,559
It's the end of that sounds like communism under one call it a game

162
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,935
If you if you look at where a lot of these beliefs come from most of it comes from

163
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Rampant

164
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Communist

165
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Fear propaganda

166
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Years and years ago

167
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
I meant

168
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
Also just rum

169
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,295
Flimsiest Oracle

170
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
I promise

171
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
I'll do a much better job of

172
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
Explaining all of what's wrong with my near future

173
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
We be here for 6 hour

174
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
So we're not going

175
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Do that that always

176
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Most Anti socialism propaganda comes from the people who are threat

177
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
Teton Volkswagen

178
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
Be of the people who are best served by these narratives

179
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Want to retain

180
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Corporate capital

181
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
Exploitation Brothers control

182
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
So my biggest point that I wanted to make with people who are saying that like

183
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
He's just calling to see if there's a reason for it

184
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Piece of his worldview

185
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
I don't really watch the video don't particularly want to go over that

186
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
So we're not talking about that and not because I don't like a half hour of the show

187
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Cologne

188
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Emergency reporting

189
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
I just don't find it all that interesting and I don't

190
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
I don't know I mean it's just

191
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
Fear fear being repackaged with

192
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
But

193
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
You put out a special report on Saturday

194
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Which is yesterday as we're recording us

195
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Sunday

196
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Fourth of July is the last

197
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Fourth of July

198
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Okay

199
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Now then

200
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
He just wants to sell

201
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Stop

202
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,903
Bill Pullman

203
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
When you mean

204
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Put out an 11-minute video and I really thought it was going to be his Bill Pullman speech like

205
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Bill Pullman

206
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,447
Alex came to the studio.

207
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
He's just like this will be

208
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
The beginning of

209
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
1776

210
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,151
624

211
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
He's just redoing all this stuff and that we're under attack

212
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
I want you

213
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
To get 50% off

214
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Closest Vystar

July 3rd

216
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
Prices 205

217
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,407
I don't know I'm trying to repackage I don't know okay

218
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Rehab

219
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Rodger Stone taping

220
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
I haven't been forced to come before a grand jury

221
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
We have Rodger Stone admitting that

222
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
He met with a guy about getting dirt from Hillary to steps

223
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Is it a Russian guy

224
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
We have

225
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Indication

226
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
They're coming out now that North Korea is actually ramping up nuclear testing

227
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
The other day

228
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Homeland Security

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Came out

230
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
It started with we must

231
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Secure

232
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,391
And the title was 14 hours long

233
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
We have all this stuff

234
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Coming I like

235
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
I think that Alex

236
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
Is realizing

237
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
All these marches around the country

238
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
29th and

239
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
All these marches were people were coming

240
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Together again

241
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
Family separation policy

242
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
How we treat immigrants

243
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
That turned into a lot of abolish ice protest

244
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
You know what have you

245
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
S***

246
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
Alexandria ocasio-cortez

247
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Who's won

248
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
In New York as a Democratic Socialist

249
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Enunciated the first

250
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Who was everyone keep saying was

251
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Inline

252
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
For possible house speaker

253
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
He's not dumb.

254
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
See the writing on the wall to put up

255
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
The front of like

256
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Havis super-powerful Democrat lost

257
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Mary Ray

258
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Alex

259
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
He has to realize.

260
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Socialist

261
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
A very popular entrenched

262
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
The Democrat

263
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
That means more to him

264
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
So I think he's

265
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
He's just really scared

266
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
He's going to be lashing out

267
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
What about you

268
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
I do

269
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Is the 28th

270
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
June 28th

271
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
We got that Thursday episode

272
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
We talkin about because

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Alex Jones might be trolling me

274
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
And Rodger Stone might also be trolling

275
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
Are there specifically targeting

276
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Text drop

277
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
Alex that beard is looking really good

278
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
No

279
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
No

280
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,279
Going to stop

281
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
I think

282
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,007
I've heard about the studiously avoided looking at it

283
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Get the beer

284
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
Atrocious

285
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
It's it's gross he looks like a disaster

286
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
I believe he's been referred to as chubby

287
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
Wolverine couple times

288
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Background research on me

289
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
To know that I very strong opinions about

290
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
You do have a lot of beer

291
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Not you trying to trigger me

292
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
Alex is what it is

293
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
It is making fun of Alex in the most

294
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Obtuse way possible

295
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Perhaps

296
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
So this Thursday

297
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,439
You think there's one sort of main line that goes throughout it and then that we get a weirdo gas

298
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,119
Here is what I would say is Alex's main thrust

299
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
On the Thursday show this is the game he wants to play

300
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Shamanism

301
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
The thread that runs through out of the

302
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
First

303
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Bobbitt of the show

304
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,687
We have the globalist in total connection fits over

305
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Justice

306
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
Rockstone would be waving

307
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
When they released

308
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,535
Giving the lepus the biggest defensive fear they had yet where we going

309
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
For some of that

310
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,447
Rogers get on airplane right now

311
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,799

Most conservative

314
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Well you know what he wants to do

315
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Alexandria

316
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Ocasio-cortez

317
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,527
Supreme Court Justices going to be

318
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,391
Boy I remember reading through the oldest

319
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
The Judge Jeanine Pirro

320
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Yeah

321
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255

322
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791

Aripiprazole list

324
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
That originally put out instead of

Neil Gorsuch there is the whole like 17 possible one or serve

326

Murderers Row of awful

327
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
I don't think we passed the bar I really don't think you didn't think they're all required

328
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,207
Wasn't wasn't Garfield both the Supreme Court Justice and president

329
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,375
I still Betty passed the bar I didn't couldn't read requirement that was a time before the Gutenberg Bible

330
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Requirements Army releases

331
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Exact

332
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
You are correct

333
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
So no other thoughts and other ideas

334
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
I will invade for my TV

335
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
I don't know if they'll

336
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
David Naughton play

337
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
But before he gets

338
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,279
You got to keep up

339
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Which eye is that

340
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Interesting

341
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Sort of standard

342
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Play Metallica

343
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,591
And I read an article

344
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,223
Foreign Affairs and others thought you were so stupid

345
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,063
World

346
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
That ABC CBS NBC

347
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
Reminder CNN MSNBC

348
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
You're crazy I don't want

349
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Obamacare

350
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
I got bad news man

351
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
This is because I f****** newsletter he pulled out

352
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
It's probably because of all the races

353
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,927
Probably cuz it's super racist newsletter racist newsletter

354
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Right but

355
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
In the first person

356
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,119
We called the Ron Paul report

357
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Yeah no s*** so there's that

358
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
I bet example for him to bring up

359
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
And then also if you want to say that that's the talking point

360
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
This is your talk

361
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
Because I don't

362
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:06,271
I've never accused of being racist cuz he doesn't like Obamacare

363
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,159
I would say that might be a piece of why she doesn't like Obamacare but my arguments are much deeper than that

364
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
In terms of what makes him

365
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Would we got over right nausea

366
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
Medic is the Reliance on auntie

367
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Dometic tropes

368
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
And the idea of it

369
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Still believe

370
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
These archaic versions of anti-Semitism and applies them to the modern-day it has nothing to do with his idea about the Federal Reserve

371
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
Being a privately-run organization

372
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
That is a

373
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Bernard he's using

374
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Strawman

375
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
To get himself off the hook of racism

376
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
December Temecula

377
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Brett just boring

378
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Hate the modern day

379
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,255
Because so much of it is I say this they say I'm going to say this

380
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
I didn't say that they said that

381
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
This is what they said

382
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Too much it's bickering

383
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,727
As a as a ring

384
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
Is bickering with fake versions of arguments against

385
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Himself to respond to

386
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Which is fun

387
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
I mean

388
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,551
But even in cheers in like season 7 they got together like you can only pick her for so long before you got to f***

389
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Will they won't they

390
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,512
Is if you are going to bicker back and forth with the mainstream media

391
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Sooner or later

392
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:27,936
You got a you guys got to come together and figure out a medium ground and then you date for a couple of seasons

393
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
There's a big wedding

394
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
Incredible just describing scrubs it like house

395
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Where are you

396
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,528
Cuddy get together but then it might have been him having a opioid

397
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Hallucinate great

398
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,208
And had a complete opposite day show

399
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
I think he has been

400
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
4 years

401
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Another I mean for him

402
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
He just said he's read a bunch of stuff

403
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,872
Just gives it all the way honest

404
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
I think Alexandria is the best

405
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Sitcom from the millennials

406
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
Would be lovely except we're all going to die before we can X

407
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
We solve this b******* that the Baby Boomers left us

408
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
So I think what we should do is

409
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,936
Working towards a better future for our kids for the kids

410
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Anthony Anthony

411
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
In this

412
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
What you're really afraid of

413
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
All the time

414
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
I don't think there's a ton of value

415
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,816
All of these products are marked out to the point where the discount isn't even real so this is like

416
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,168
This is really just a mess RPG that you're playing that you're paying for these

417
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,544
The auto-ship discount is b*******.

418
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
Anyway

419
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
It could happen at any point

420
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
It's not very

421
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Does the next couple clips

422
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
I really want a big reasons why I decided

423
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
This is episode we got to go over

424
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Alex gets into an allegory

425
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,352
Might be a little misguided for a number of reasons

426
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
No but it is something

427
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
Now I have not studied

428
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
IMovie

429
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
It right but I did study classics

430
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
In college I studied

431
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
Greek through that I read a lot of Mythology

432
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Alex Jones

433
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
Did they predict 2012

434
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
Hillary America

435
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Here's why you got to let him have the allegory baby

436
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Part of this

437
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
You can say that

438
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
You could

439
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
Are you staying with the whole step

440
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
In the mythical

441
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
Story of

442
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
Head

443
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Severed

444
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,072
Forgot that I forgot her name but yes

445
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,424
Event at the defeat globalist Kraken with

446
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
Do you know what

447
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,896
I as much as I know you know way more and I don't want to embarrass myself so please

448
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,016
Yet Clips deconstruct with wrong

449
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Presented

450
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
The first thing that needs to

451
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,720
To be done is cut off Medusa the Gorgons head

452
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
Much like in mythology

453
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
But before that will let Alex

454
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Flesh out his ID

455
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,664
As the symbol of the dominoes falling to bring down globalism will be complete

456
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
Archetype

457
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,584
Has the Medusa head of the global network.com

458
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Hollywood all of it

459
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
Hollywood

460
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
He was involved in all of it

461
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
And her head

462
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
Is a blueprint

463
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
To defeat them

464
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,392
I don't like that freezing at the end there this early it seems a lot like maybe so

465
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,512
Second Amendment people can take care of her

466
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,352
Although he does later say that rather should go follow

467
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
In a grave

468
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Politico

469
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:21,056
Okay well that's nice to say that cuz of what happened this week with Milo that.

470
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
Everything I've been able to tell about that case

471
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
I don't think that guy was necessarily inspired by Milo saying

472
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,552
Not to say that Milo is okay or off the hook but it doesn't appear that that guy

473
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Seems like you had a long-standing

474
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Put that paper

475
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
And had a hold

476
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
I don't doubt that Milo specific

477
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,824
I don't I don't doubt that effect at all and then you also have these remember

478
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
They put out a piece

479
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Peace where there is like

480
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Are two bunch of their hate mail

481
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
And stuff like that posted a bunch of things

482
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
The people that sent them of course

483
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
Whether or not this guy was motivated

484
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
From

485
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Specific

486
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Received grievance

487
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Or generalize it doesn't matter

488
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
It's symptomatic of something that

489
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
All journalists are

490
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Racist

491
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Sexist

492
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Android

493
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
Just overall violent threats on their existence

494
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
And all that.

495
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,800
Are we indeed

496
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
Just the the concept of it

497
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
You should not be in the mainstream as a

498
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
What is is permeated throughout by Trump and by Milo and all of this stuff is

499
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
It's open season

500
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,208
Right right

501
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
Exact response

502
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Does lot of people have to the shooting on

503
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Do you like

504
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
Gab

505
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
CB posted were like good journalist

506
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Should live in

507
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
That's a really

508
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Cancerous

509
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Oh yeah

510
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
Cuz even like I think Alex is one of the biggest

511
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Problems

512
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
We have

513
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
In the public rhetoric

514
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
And discourse but I don't think

515
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
People should hurt him

516
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
Like I think we've gone out of our way to

517
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
To be very but you might

518
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,816
You might want to beat up view my email

519
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Political

520
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
No

521
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,984
A little baby got back to the analogy

522
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
Gentleman

523
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Persis

524
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Medusa

525
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Is ready

526
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
The Vanquish

527
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,928
There's one more thing

528
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
Really not using the word

529
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Trump doesn't have the air

530
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Needs a horse

531
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,128
On the horse

532
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
In the sky

533
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Winter hat

534
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,064
Analogy of

535
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,392
Trump and Morgan and the Kraken

536
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,720
The blooming day are releasing the Kraken

537
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,056
So tell me about Perseus slaying Medusa begins with his mother Danny being

538
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
Situation where she was going to be married

539
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
To polydectes

540
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
Perseus viewed as a bad man

541
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
In order to do away with Perseus

542
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Because he was always standing

543
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,136
In between the marriage the other polydektes wanted to have

544
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
Inflamed throat

545
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
To bring a specific gift

546
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
In this case he chose a horse

547
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
To honor hippodamia

548
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
The god or goddess of horse

549
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
He did this because he knew the Perseus didn't have a horse

550
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,336
Right since that was the case Perseus offered call the dictys an option

551
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,200
And then attempt to get rid of him polydektes chose the head of Medusa

552
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
Knowing that I would probably give her

553
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
Perseus was he have some

554
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
Jesus he got some help from the gods

555
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
In terms of gear

556
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,720
But you got the Helm of invisibility from Hades rats flying

557
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
I like it like that

558
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,168
Yeah yeah yeah

559
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,008
So with all that gear until he went off and killed Medusa

560
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,336
He returned with Medusa's head

561
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
I mean

562
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
Based on the story yes but if you look at it actually it's not great

563
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Heroic Lee

564
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
Murdered her while she slept

565
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,672
If I remember her as well correctly

566
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
She was f***** over

567
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,304
And then okay

568
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,424
So he returned with Medusa's head only to find a polydektes of made his mother

569
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Since she would not marry him even with Percy

570
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
She is gone

571
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,848
Perseus call Angie Alda all all of our friends don't look

572
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
Something like along those lines

573
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
Everyone married to Stone

574
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
With Medusa's head

575
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
Mercy killed Atlas

576
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
The guy who has to push the world uphill and goatee

577
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,120
To keep doing this

578
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
Of course he's a dick

579
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
How long is Prometheus

580
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
Call Ty

581
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
Credit

582
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,296
So long to Battle Creek

583
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,672
That is because Krakens are not part of Greek mythology

584
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:05,120
Century Icelandic tales about Seabourn monsters mythical creatures

585
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,680
Real living cephalopod

586
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,032
Carl Linnaeus even included is original taxonomy of biological

587
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Creatures

588
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Animator Edition

589
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Took it out

590
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
The original

591
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
I did not know that

592
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,392
This stuff is not real

593
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Pudding

594
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Finer points

595
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
What Hillary did and didn't do in the campaign

596
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,120
Not the painter is any kind of heroics a better comparison

597
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
A Hillary Clinton Medusa would be the following

598
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Medusa

599
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
Eraser in Athena's Temple

600
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Athena blame

601
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Medusa

602
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
It made her face horrifying as so as to turn

603
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
Who looked upon her into stone

604
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
From that point forward

605
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
Because of something that happened to her

606
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
She ceased to be human

607
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
But instead became a grotesque Nvidia symbol

608
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
You might say

609
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
But Alex Jones has done that with Hillary

610
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,144
Poseidon I guess in this case will be Larry Nichols

611
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
Alright alright

612
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Alright

613
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
I don't know

614
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
I don't know

615
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
Issue is like

616
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
This stuff that I want to talk about it

617
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
A mythology

618
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
It's from that class of the tie

619
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
Exactly

620
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,048
Architect

621
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't remember a f****** Kraken

622
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:47,520
I don't remember I remember I remember a lot of

623
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
Mythology I don't remember

624
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
A some story.

625
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Like a Minotaur

626
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
To go with

627
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Theseus

628
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Military refund

629
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,136
The stories too but he's so much better than most other religion

630
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,000
It's so good I love mythology

631
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
To like you know like

632
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Native American culture

633
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
I love mythology

634
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Too seriously

635
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,032
Dump when you pretend that movies that came out in the 2010s

636
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
Represent actual archetypes

637
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
Rhombus ology what you're doing is

638
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Very stupid

639
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
And that's what happens when you drop out of junior college and think you're really smart

640
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
I really don't think he's using the word archetype

641
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Correctly I think ever

642
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,744
You trying to this 60/40 relationship

643
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
Noemi is batting average

644
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
Wailord

645
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:54,336
Turn music music correctly before

646
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Kraken rambling

647
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
Stand-alone

648
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
That like rant about the problem

649
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
Is that the idea

650
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Now that

651
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,888
You slayed Medusa and has to fight the Kraken

652
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,752
Because Pegasus is what's going to get him up and fly him to the place where he needs to be

653
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
Look if you go back to

654
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
The Perseus myth

655
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,640
If you slayed Medusa he already has Pegasus Baker

656
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
Came out of Medusa but he killed her

657
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
That's part of the whole myth it's not like

658
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
If you have killed the Gorgon

659
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:42,208
You are friends with Pegasus I remember

660
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,096
The Disney movie Hercules Zeus and Hera and they had

661
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
The Great

662
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:55,264
A pair of loving parent if I recall correctly

663
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Pegasus

664
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,360
Actually the result of the original rape of Poseidon

665
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,688
Library

666
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,504
You know it is The Offspring of

667
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Poseidon and

668
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
Medusa

669
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
I think

670
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
If I was going to grade his paper

671
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
When I say

672
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
You can't have a paragraph As a paper that doesn't count

673
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,448
You're going to have to go back and rewrite it

674
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
At the very least

675
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
Hamburger recipe

676
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
At the very least ambergris

677
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Did you drop out of chicken

678
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
Do I graduated from

679
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
It's like a basic you know intro all 3.3 paragraph suppose dragons like lettuce Burger

680
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
I've never heard it called that

681
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
I just assumed

682
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
Formulaic

683
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Exactly

684
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
Did not know

685
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Burger Time

686
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Excited

Avis no Leisure Suit Larry

689
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
I said I was at

690
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
It's really fun

691
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,392
From a historical

692
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
His favorite villain

693
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,560
Almost

694
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
And the UN

695
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,704
But most of the nutritions in Bloomberg

696
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
Most of the

697
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
Workers comp and an ambulance chaser

698
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,128
Exploding Tire

699
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Stop in the country

700
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Financed by George Soros

701
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Most of it

702
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
What

703
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Think about what you think about that

704
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
What do I say

705
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,096
I mean why is it used

706
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Just once

707
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Zeus wants people to do

708
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,544
GM up the courts with his b*******

709
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
Most most most every amulet if you ever seen a commercial that's like have you ever had

710
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,528
Meet me there filho

711
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Back of the Yellow Pages back in the day that was also Rose baby

712
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
He's not

713
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,984
I was curious about this one

714
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,640
That doesn't make any sense

715
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
Blue burger that means I have a thread

716
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
Call Fletcher

717
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
Alex is reading and chocolate is actually probably this opinion piece it was on the Rockwell's website

718
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Play xanarchy article

719
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
But in that article also mentions the Bloomberg

720
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
But I think Alex just

721
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
Use that to give himself

722
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,656
Veneer of credibility because the Bloomberg

723
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Not at all sport the assertions that

724
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,496
Arete you from the Bloomberg article

725
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,848
Soros fund management is pushing into the branch of litigation

726
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
Finance

727
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
That's a few head sponsor

728

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
It's creating investment portfolios out of lawsuit

730
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
According to a regulatory sign

731
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,136
The Firm Soros is backing

732
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
Bundles cash advances

733
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Fitzmall shops

734
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
The plaintiffs in personal injury suits in return

735
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Supercut future events

736
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,864
Wall Street has been bedding for a while on commercial litigation

737
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
Which provides corporate suits

738
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Millions or even billions of dollars at

739
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Cirrhosis focused on the consumer side

740
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
For plaintiff

741
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,872
Adventures of $2,000 on average for legal claim

742
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
To Auto and construction

743
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
To cover personal expenses

744
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Such as medical bills

745
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,416
Increase frivolous lawsuit that argument is made and

746
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
I don't know necessarily if that's true

747
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,096
Certainly there's no data to support that at this point

748
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
Led to an increase in

749
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
What's lawsuit

750
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
What are the important

751
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
One of the more important

752
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Consider is

753
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,384
Industry proponents say the funding helps people win appropriate payouts instead of settling

754
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
Pennies on the dollar

755
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Under the pressure of medical bills

756
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
We're missed income from work right

757
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
Pay back the advances if they lose their case

758
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
So as opposed to cash advances people could get me situations lateral like cars and houses yet

759
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Just a piece of paper

760
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
If the case goes south

761
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
There's nothing

762
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
The funding group

763
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
Group can reclaim

764
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
We're take away 4

765
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
I think

766
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
Wild weed

767
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,776
Keep an eye on the idea that frivolous lawsuits could go up

768
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
This sort of thing isn't

769
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
Incredibly powerful be helpful

770
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
Do people who are square

771
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
They have a righteous suit

772
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
Against somebody

773
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,856
Can't pay their medical bills or let's say it has something to do with their car and the car is totaled they can't get

774
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
Transportation

775
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Without

776
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,512
Some sort of like $2,000

777
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,352
In order to get by as they proceed through this

778
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
Then they get their settlement of like

779
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,472
$15,000 or whatever payback for 2000

780
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
Even walk away with a 13

781
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
In the fair

782
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Should have gotten from

783
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
As opposed to settling for like

784
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
$3,000

785
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,712
In the meantime while the case is going on

786
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,576
Racking up like eight grand in debt or something like that

787
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,904
A really positive very helpful

788
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,536
Soros funds all of the ambulance chasing in America

789
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Horseshit

790
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,632
I don't know how I don't know exactly

791
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,960
I feel like it's a good thing at the same time I don't

792
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
Know if I like an investment Bank

793
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Bankrolling

794
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
Lawsuit no idea how I feel about that.

795
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,295
For decades already

796
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,903
It's been going on for decades are largely it's only the

797
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
I'm Avenue of large firms

798
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Big corporate

799
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:14,655
The higher Stakes a reward

800
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
You get like a much bigger

801
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,263
Have a bigger Spot the Difference

802
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Supplying it Mighty group

803
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,407
Which he has put some funding is applying it

804
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Two people who

805
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:31,039
Don't have tons of resources behind them

806
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,647
You know it's one of those things

807
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
It seems like

808
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
There are parts of it that I don't know if I feel

809
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
But the bigger

810
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
If

811
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
Done well this is great

812
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
Yes that's what I feel about it

813
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Goes

814
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
Great

815
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,079
Bye

816
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Think that

817
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,687
It is a good concept that should not have been privatized

818
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,295
That's what I think cuz I think ultimately this is like

819
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,135
Yeah this is ultimately a pro-labor kind of situation

820
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,023
Exactly

821
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
They should absolutely be allowed to because if you're fighting up against a multibillion-dollar corporation

822
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
And you can't afford food

823
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,871
You're much more likely to settle and they're much more likely to get away with

824
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,903
I've got like a we're going to Asian flush

825
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
I'm all for this

826
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
At the same time I don't like they're being like an investment firm

827
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,703
I just don't like the words investment firm I don't know I don't know

828
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,567
I don't know I don't think

829
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
I don't know I don't I don't feel like all we're doing is saying like

830
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
I would need to look into this

831
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
Figure out whether or not I

832
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
Been around this little button on the end

833
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
I would say

834
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
Kudos also

835
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,471
Not what I want to say

836
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
So I don't know if you remember this

837
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Michelle Alex

838
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
Court Piqua

839
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
All In

840
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
Why'd you keep saying all in

841
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Secret f****** show up

842
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Show

843
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Is all in

844
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
He's running the back

845
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:51,583
We Are One

846
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,959
Who is the person about to be nominated

847
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,031
To replace the outgoing Justice Kennedy

848
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,615
Pathetic the time

849
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
They are looking to put

850
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
A better person

851
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,071
Very very very very very

852
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
Call your neighbors or friends or family Thumbkin infowars.com

853
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,895
Driving

854
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
Yes it is

855
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
That was my first reaction but I do

856
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:52,511
This level of doing it all the time

857
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Rarely does he like

858
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
The f****** call people

859
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,959
You only pull that out occasionally that's level does only come out

860
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:07,359
Like I know we experienced during this fake FEMA camp s*** 2009

861
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
Yeah generally generally speaking

862
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
It's just the tease is there

863
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
Keeps going forever do you like stop people in traffic

864
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
That's where the thing is like

865
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
That's pretty special

866
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:26,047
Any idea who the pic is Neil Gorsuch is kid like

867
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
Maybe it's

868
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
No there's not a Drudge

869
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
I don't know

870
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,151
I don't know judges you think of any judges

871
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,991
I can't think of any judges except for Joe Brown

872
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Mills Lane

873
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,367
Bill's latest judge from Celebrity Deathmatch

874
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,815
Your your level of weird

875
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Good life

876
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
We're ready for it.

877
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
To break

878
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Emily comes back

879
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
He's clearly talked to Rodger Stone

880
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Rogers like

881
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Shut the fuk up

882
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,247
That it's really fun okay cuz we get a very clear picture

883
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Of where Alex is getting

884
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Permission to say things

885
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
From

886
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:28,255
Homophone

887
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:33,887
Trump Supreme Court

888
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,103
About this on air before

889
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:53,599
Let's just say this in the front run

890
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
You're the next one

891
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
About that

892
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
In the next

893
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,631
But this is big

894
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:11,263
So he is a little bit like you being told to shut up.

895
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,311
You're you're going to

896
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
Going to blow up a spot here

897
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,919
Because obviously what he's about to say

898
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Is

899
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,479
Man I hope it's not true

900
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
I don't think it's true

901
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:27,135
He's about to reveal at that lucky will I will day.

902
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,207
He doesn't reveal what the name is

903
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
It man I really don't think there's any

904
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,607
I will head

905
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
He's someone who I have joked

906
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,239
It's going to be alright

907
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:48,639
Whether it's socially on this show or on Twitter I have made the joke that this is going to

908
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
To be our next Supreme Court.

909
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Okay

910
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:58,111
You allow for the possibility that this is part of the teas

911
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,647
That this is the work now

912
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
You wouldn't allow for that because of this

913
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
So this will be

914
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
Information is

915
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Direct

916
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
From El Presidente

917
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,335
Phone calls

918
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
Enterprise

919
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
The calculus

920
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Whatever

921
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,743
So the reason I don't

922
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:40,607
Because he's spinning out on Airline

923
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:45,471
What does Buckeyes

924
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,031
Don't put it that way don't talk like that

925
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
Because Rodger Stone probably knows

926
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,431
Can s*** like he's doing his like back of cigar shop talk

927
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,063
Look look

928
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Stupid or something like that

929
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
I imagine that they'll buy that

930
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,951
That's the only explanation I can come

931
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,791
Love watching Alex look stupid

932
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:14,911
Bridgestone

933
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,263
In that way of like I'm giving you a compliment and yet at the same time

934
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
The biggest Joy

935
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
His professional career right now

936
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
This is you

937
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Projecting onto Rodger

938
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
You're too much what that's what you want Rodger

939
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,599
To be doing I think a lot of times he's not

940
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
Steve

941
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,231
Subway

942
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,279
For his own

943
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,863
And I don't think the Alex saying that Rodger has told him

944
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
That this is going to be the next Supreme Court Justice

945
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,703
And it turns out he's not

946
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
I don't think that works

947
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Mister Rogers been

948
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,335
That might be the game that's being played out behind this

949
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,783
So far

950
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
This weird spot

951
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
So that he gets that you shift over

952
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
He doesn't lie plays like a video of Rod Rosa

953
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Being being

954
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,767
I interviewed by

955
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Jim Jordan

956
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Trey Gowdy

957
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:20,191
They're giving him the business is not providing documents

958
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
Undercover stuff

959
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Rod Rosenstein the whole time is like

960
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
When

961
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Something is redacted

962
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
That doesn't mean I did it

963
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
He's just trying to explain that like

964
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,551
Sizzle large organization that we have here

965
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,623
Doesn't mean that I did I crossed out everything

966
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
I have 50

967
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
2018 super whatever

968
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
There's a whole organizational structure I'm not withholding information from you at the gym Jordan opencl item

969
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
So you're telling me

970
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
That these redacted document

971
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,615
Not just black panther

972
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,015
Crosses out the stuff he doesn't want to see it's not like he's a grade school teacher being like

973
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,575
You're going to need to get rid of this sentence we got a

974
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
Remove some wording around

975
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
It's not that

976
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:17,535
It's not that

977
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Miss hearing

978
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Clips of

979
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
You know

980
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
It's not a thing where I rule over

981
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
This department

982
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
It's a thing where

983
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
Iva head of it

984
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,735
But there is a lot of organizational structure to it and I don't oversee literally every single thing

985
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:43,391
Micromanage

986
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,023
Is it really worked out well

987
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,071
Doj is clearly

988
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,351
Smooth

989
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,935
Jordan's argument seems to be

990
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
You run everything

991
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,983
Which is not

992
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
I don't

993
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,663
Tri-County pardon

994
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Trey Gowdy saying

995
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
This investigation is hurting America

996
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Too much of the clip

997
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
Starts with like

998
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Russia attacking America

999
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,975
But they're not being hurt by this

1000
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,535
We are our processes being hurt

1001
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,935
We need to wrap this up as wrong about the idea that we need to

1002
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:35,615
You even presented as like this is a real thing where Russia

1003
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,919
Anyway it's a hot mess

1004
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
And there's no real point

1005
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
Phyllis Denny

1006
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
If you want to go listen to the hearings

1007
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
You're welcome to

1008
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
You know exactly what our two

1009
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,391
Point on it is he's lying under oath we taught him

1010
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
He's not

1011
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
It's ridiculous

1012
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,559
The Hill New York

1013
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,079
More crap but

1014
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,151
This is quite a spectacle

1015
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Trump son

1016
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,503
Murder everyone kill me

1017
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
Kilmore members of Congress

1018
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,599
Show host

1019
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,207
Router

1020
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Certainly

1021
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
And physically

1022
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,863
Lynch Mob me on the street

1023
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
Simulation

1024
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Taking it back

1025
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Get back

1026
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
With the 14-year words

1027
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
We must secure

1028
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
Yeah that's really the vibe of what

1029
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,951
You know the people who are taking

1030
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Things back

1031
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
A point where

1032
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,303
Lot of people didn't

1033
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,655
Like a lot of those

1034
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,959
Lot of things exciting as like a

1035
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
Horrible things

1036
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
The Liberals are doing

1037
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
You're talkin about like people who did

1038
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
And I'll maybe

1039
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Maybe

1040
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
Maybe a little out there tweet

1041
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
About like hey

1042
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,295
People's families are being taken apart

1043
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,111
You know like that sort of thing

1044
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:26,719
I'm fine with that I understand if I don't really care

1045
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
I think that you went

1046
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,839
Do you open up the possibility of Alex saying that

1047
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:39,519
No matter what I'm not saying don't say stuff like that cuz the intent is to highlight how horse

1048
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Find

1049
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,335
Are being separated from them

1050
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,151
I don't think I've course hours

1051
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:50,783
The whole thing about the restraining your language and stuff like that

1052
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
Which I've been very much on the side

1053
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Now I'm here for you

1054
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,951
Well that's it but that's one thing that you can draw from Alexandria

1055
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Who gives a f***

1056
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
They're going to hear if you're the most middle-of-the-road neoliberal Obama all over

1057
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,383
Repulsive

1058
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,247
If I was running for president right now

1059
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,783
What states are guns

1060
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,487
Why not

1061
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Dax Style

1062
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,071
D-Generation X Style

1063
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,631
Call promo

1064
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,191
It would always end

1065
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
If you don't you're not down with me

1066
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
Suck it all right

1067
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,503
Like that we kick in with the theme song of the other Run DMC

1068
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,807
C version of the DX theme song

1069
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,463
A boy you realized chop is the primary

1070
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,863
Never had a chance to get lytical suicide

1071
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
Sonofabitch

1072
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,823
I was just DMX and say

1073
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
Say it

1074
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
WhatsApp

1075
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
Socialized Healthcare

1076
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
Jordan go give it to you

1077
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
I'm slipping

1078
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
I'm falling

1079
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Get up

1080
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Right

1081
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Flipping

1082
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
I'm falling

1083
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
I can't get up

1084
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
Give me back on my feet

1085
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
So I can test you

1086
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
What's DMX

1087
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,631
DMX lyrics

1088
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
I was just letting you know

1089
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,495
I knew you were going to give it to me

1090
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Stream Court thing

1091
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
And I

1092
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
In the process

1093
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
To clear that

1094
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
It's Rogers

1095
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,343
I know you are my next nominee

1096
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
And

1097
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:15,167
Then it becomes well don't

1098
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
We look mad on here

1099
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,479
About that's because Rodger has

1100
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:33,599
None of these people can actually still

1101
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:39,999
Ian Rodger

1102
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:52,287
I just called him pretending to be a senator

1103
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
You could talk to him

1104
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,919
Thought we might find out a way here in a little bit

1105
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
So

1106
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Who cares about all that

1107
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
You said nothing

1108
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
Having a fight with Rodger

1109
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
A lovers quarrel

1110
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
Indeed

1111
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
So in 2009

1112
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,887
2009 episode we covered that February 11th episode

1113
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,239
Where became never forget crystal clear to me especially

1114
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
I think I was late

1115
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
To the party

1116
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
I got to run out to jumped on it

1117
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:31,967
Who's already been Alex's principles were largely based in fear of things that eventually could be done to

1118
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,319
The idea of you no minorities being put in camps

1119
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Didn't bother him

1120
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,415
He just was bothered about the idea that eventually they're going to do it

1121
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
To us good people

1122
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
Present

1123
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
American

1124
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Western

1125
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:50,399
People once the slippery slope became a plateau he was like

1126
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,471
I'm fine with that

1127
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,823
Scales falling from my eyes

1128
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
I hear Clips like this from the present day

1129
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Quite differently

1130
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,183
I was against the left and blameless in the Ford Foundation

1131
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975
Center

1132
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,047
When the training manuals

1133
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:26,751
American Bill of Rights

1134
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,847
Free market is down

1135
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,895
Gun owners are going to have to be put

1136
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
In Fremont

1137
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,783
I don't want that all of those things that you talkin about are all misrepresent a

1138
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
Is all of this idea

1139
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:44,671
These people are being trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center the George Washington is bad and

1140
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
And stuff like that

1141
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,255
That is all misrepresentation of

1142
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
People

1143
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
Realizing

1144
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,351
That

1145
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
White

1146
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
Terrorism is a real thing

1147
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
And it is very active

1148
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
I told law enforcement is trained

1149
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
To deal with that or

1150
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
To look at it as a

1151
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
The priority

1152
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
To Alex's

1153
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Major threat

1154
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
Which

1155
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,455
It shouldn't

1156
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,319
What terrorists are Alex

1157
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Hand

1158
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
Largely his guest list

1159
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
He's just mad

1160
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:25,631
Because he's not on broadcast stations in prisons if he was on broadcast stations in prison

1161
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,447
He would be fine with white terrorists being caught

1162
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:35,103
Cuz any till I've listened no cuz they can't get like super blue through the commissary

1163
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
For-profit prisons

1164
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,855
Everything contract with the prison

1165
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,927
Industry like for his product

1166
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,399
Depressive state is great

1167
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:04,799
Someone else we will end up in a police bait Hallelujah

1168
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,639
Prison where his act like a market that he could suck off

1169
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
Oh yeah

1170
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,991
It's one hundred percent

1171
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
So

1172
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,879
I'm not entirely sure what

1173
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,183
To say about this next clip other than I know that

1174
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,999
I mislabeled this

1175
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
It's very vaguely

1176
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
Did you just label it not accurate

1177
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
Labeled Trump is actually the nice one

1178
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,751
And I don't exactly remember

1179
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:39,103
I thought that would trigger in my brain like what he was talking about but it's so

1180
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
It's too vague I don't really remember so let's enjoy it

1181
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,463
He doesn't roll over when you attacking you

1182
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,583
You're so mean.

1183
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,119
Proving

1184
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
You had us under suppression

1185
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,727
Surface

1186
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,799
Trump

1187
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:19,551
Oxygen has been trapped underwater

1188
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
I just kept that black part in there

1189
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
I don't know I just

1190
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Real

1191
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
We want to cause depression

1192
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,343
What I hear out of

1193
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
Love me

1194
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,719
Well there's that there's that there's

1195
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
Deerwood

1196
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
Makes me kind of can

1197
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
Convinced

1198
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
It's it's like

1199
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Come down

1200
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
To a civil war

1201
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,519
You been talkin like this a little bit lately and

1202
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,543
Makes me a little

1203
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,943
And this isn't like

1204
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,503
Afraid of is opposed to something

1205
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:26,623
The precipitate know I don't even think I'm afraid of it I think I'm

1206
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,951
I think it's more like I feel like

1207
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Because

1208
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,535
Here's how I hear

1209
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
This is what convinces me

1210
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
That

1211
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,519
A civil war or even just like not necessarily A warlike

1212
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
Break up the f****** country

1213
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,359
Communicate

1214
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,175
Like there's no

1215
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:56,575
You want the nullification

1216
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:02,975
Finally realizing that there's no Reaching Across the aisle

1217
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,535
Disorders like impune Barack Obama back in

1218
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,327
That you would always talk about how

1219
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Comparing him to Lincoln

1220
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
How many go to Lincoln

1221
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Beaches that are like

1222
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
If I could save the Union

1223
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,263
What would be required is

1224
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
Accepting

1225
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,127
People have slaves or whatever

1226
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
We probably do that

1227
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
Preserving the Union

1228
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
Geography

1229
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,951
If we could if if

1230
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,791
If Chicago and New York and l.a.

1231
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,095
Just those three cities were like

1232
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:47,775
And we all live near each other we would create a like it would just be

1233
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,335
We're done we can flip flop like a

1234
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,151
I don't want to say this

1235
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Who's going to be like

1236
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
People in Wyoming

1237
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Put New York and Wyoming

1238
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,743
Are we are we playing

1239
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
Arizona

1240
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Now we got the West

1241
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,399
You know your Eastern seaboard

1242
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
The issue is

1243
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,495
It's just like we don't have it it split correctly

1244
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,383
Urban vs rural the problem becomes

1245
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,967
Imaginary

1246
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,063
Chicago and New York move to the West Coast

1247
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:37,183
Chunk of the West Coast

1248
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:42,815
We can't imagine we could have

1249
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,863
All of the culture

1250
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,191
Put all of the relevant pieces of

1251
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Spell amazing

1252
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:57,663
People in like Arkansas sucker anything like that

1253
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Those are both

1254
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,271
Those are so often over

1255
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:13,023
The rest of Austin Cantrell Austin area just like left Alec the other income

1256
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,399
Buckley

1257
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,751
Geographically it

1258
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
It's 16

1259
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
The country

1260
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,335
Used to be

1261
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
This liberal

1262
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Sliver

1263
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
AB free

1264
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Minorities

1265
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
Control over their own bodies and

1266
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
People are celebrated as

1267
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
People

1268
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
You have the other

1269
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,767
Parched

1270
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,815
I'm certain it is within

1271
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,911
Years I would imagine Manifest Destiny would pop back up

1272
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,959
Right the right

1273
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,823
Problem which is that Liberals are pussies and they get run over

1274
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,871
Become cyclical all over again

1275
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
The desire to compromise

1276
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,479
I would always come up with that

1277
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
That's why

1278
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
Vertically architect

1279
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,743
I hate to say Wyoming

1280
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
Is gorgeous

1281
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
Natural Vista

1282
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,327
New York Lottery

1283
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
This water

1284
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:25,215
Do you mean need to be a port

1285
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Lakes or Rivers

1286
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
But that's not very far west

1287
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
Great

1288
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
Push it over to

1289
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,215
The world should look like

1290
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,615
This is what I think this is our new this is our new game

1291
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:10,015
I feel

1292
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,415
Tag teams of wrestlers greatest metropolitan area

1293
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:22,815
Over into Michigan looking to have this Midwest Alliance

1294
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,399
And then we absorb into Canada cuz we're close enough

1295
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:31,263
Now that's your liberal Manifest Destiny right there we just take over Canada

1296
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Or just like

1297
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
Valletta

1298
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
My joint

1299
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
All the stuff is real

1300
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
Sucking hard to figure out

1301
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
I don't really know what

1302
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
I don't know what direction

1303
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,855
Point when the left realize

1304
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
There's no communication

1305
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,951
There's no way for us to say

1306
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:56,095
Because anything you say is going to be turned into your trying to destroy the

1307
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,191
Destroy America

1308
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,775
Destroy the market

1309
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
Yeah we can't say that

1310
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
Even though that's what they're

1311
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,991
The only way to do it is to create a more

1312
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,527
Appealing

1313
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,439
And that would be really tough without the

1314
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,255
The edgelords and weirdo meme makers

1315
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,839
Exactly her already

1316
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Is there

1317
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
The highwomen

1318
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,751
I mean I guess there's really no way for liberalism to really March

1319
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
Forward

1320
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Guns

1321
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Mad about that

1322
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Sojourn

1323
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,223
It is time to reveal

1324
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:51,391
The Supreme Court who is going

1325
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
On the roster

1326
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,743
Do you want to give any last predictions

1327
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,303
It's not Michael Jordan

1328
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,143
Call Larry Bird

1329
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,191
Judge Reinhold

1330
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:10,591
I was hoping you would resist that joke cuz it's way too easy

1331
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
Very few people

1332
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,807
Empresa de gallo and there was a supreme court vacancy

1333
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,111
I remember

1334
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:29,279
It was just in the news

1335
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,351
I learned from inside sources

1336
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,143
Not just Rodger Stone

1337
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:42,591
The big computer program

1338
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,895
Record

1339
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
Conservative judge

1340
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:57,951
Front right now live

1341
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
And that

1342
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
You said okay I'll do that

1343
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,935
Person on the bench currently

1344
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Neocon

1345
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,055
Weather bigger Longer record

1346
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,199
He is going to be the running

1347
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,343
Andrew Napolitano my dude

1348
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:31,743
That should be against the law about it

1349
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,047
Stuff like that

1350
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,351
It's crazy

1351
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Fox News

1352
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
Frequent contributor Andrew Napolitano

1353
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,335
Steven says that out loud we should have rights

1354
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:51,967
Rights in the f****** Street

1355
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,783
I did get this from Rodger Stone

1356
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:01,183
If you hadn't just got it from Rodger Stone you don't need to say it if it's not something that you're

1357
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
Preemptively defensive about because it's already

1358
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:08,863
Positive about politano

1359
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
Is it good is it good

1360
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
I'm tried it

1361
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,591
Connect

1362
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,127
That's what all deposit

1363
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,551
Civil War guy the guy who

1364
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,391
All that stuff

1365
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,415
Lincoln could have free

1366
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Replace bypass

1367
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,767
Are slaveholders all that stuff

1368
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,863
I bet everybody would have been fine with that

1369
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,239
Cuz I believe that the Supreme Court

1370
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
Oh man

1371
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,591
Good

1372
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
When

1373
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
He's

1374
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,407
Friends with

1375
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,711
Get it back

1376
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,759
It's not good for the president to be

1377
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,343
Friends with someone he's like I'm going to put on the Supreme Court

1378
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,743
Technically legal for him to appoint himself as this

1379
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Supreme Court Justice

1380
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
I mean

1381
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
Still need the law degree

1382
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,727
Does anyone know what's going on

1383
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,799
Does anybody f****** know what's going on

1384
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
This is going to have

1385
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,383
I don't think it's going to happen

1386
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,687
That's a good point

1387
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
Year-and-a-half

1388
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,247
Two years that I've been wrong almost

1389
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:35,391
Pruitt

1390
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,231
It doesn't mean

1391
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
Nothing

1392
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
Doll just going to

1393
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
Luba

1394
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,007
Slide downward whatever name he says is going to be the worst possible f******

1395
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:56,895
You get you've got a million awful people to choose from and it's not even like Kennedy with some kind of

1396
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:01,247
Swing Vote it and he was like the 10th most conservative

1397
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:05,855
History

1398
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:14,559
They were fairly important but that's just because he was the Fall Guy

1399
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:18,911
Like it like that everybody kind of got together and we're like

1400
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
For real though

1401
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:25,055
Like we all say we believe this s*** but none of us actually believe this s*** stop it

1402
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
10-year the Fall Guy

1403
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
I mean I don't I

1404
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,199
I hope

1405
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
You don't live in such a world where

1406
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
This could be treated

1407
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,087
But who f****** nose

1408
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,927
It will be revealed his big piece of news and now Rodger

1409
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
Gaston

1410
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,255
You might want to keep your pen handy for this

1411
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Might be something

1412
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
You need to write down

1413
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,095
What's Roger's got what's right

1414
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,959
Reality

1415
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:59,103
Judge Andrew Napolitano is currently how do we make sure he stays at the top

1416
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:14,207
Well if you're a Believer as I am that ended Apollo China would be a great Supreme Court Justice you should

1417
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:20,607
Call the White House switchboard where they're set up to take messages from the American people

1418
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,143
202

1419
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,727
456 1414 202

1420
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,287
456 1414

1421
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:33,151
White House switchboard with supportive calls would be

1422
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
Very helpful

1423
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,223
Keep a respectful

1424
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
Okay well Jordan is pulled out his phone

1425
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,183
As I imagine you might have done it much like when Larry Nichols gave out his phone number I think it's

1426
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,743
Switchboard

1427
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
Is a telemarketer

1428
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:03,103
And they hung up on me

1429
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,431
Great switch will give another ring

1430
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,735
You just hang up on me

1431
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
What do both

1432
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,447
Search for the White House

1433
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
As for the president

1434
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,455
Avenue clothes

01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743

Quality Inn

1440
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
Dirty Boyz

1441
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,863
Which is the worst government we've ever marry

1442
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,847
Larry Nichols

1443
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:43,199
I actually do it later

1444
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
About the cat

Trey Gowdy I apologize

1450
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
He doesn't work at the White House

1451
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
I feel like he does

1452
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,599
Yeah but he kind

1453
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,647
Where can you go

1454
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,607
Prank call

1455
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:37,727
I didn't want to prank call the White House

1456
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:49,247
Put upon that's not her fault

1457
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:54,367
Why would I ask for

1458
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:58,975
Maybe I'm talking dirty it's a fantasy house

1459
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,887
I've had sex with 45

1460
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,703
I am very gay

1461
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727

I mean pasa

1463
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,016
I'm kind of hoping that

1464
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,088
You kind of hope

1465
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
Who would you even talk to

1466
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:31,232
Trump would be up

1467
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
Manning the switchboard

1468
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,656
Himself never remember that I forgot he was Manning the switchboard

1469
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,984
Awful close to that

1470
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Call Alex

1471
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,384
Breathe

1472
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Tries to do like a really like

1473
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
Pump-up speech

1474
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,480
Does this really cool

1475
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
Coming in from break

1476
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,808
See if you can find the biggest lie

1477
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,344
In this

1478
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
Give me large

1479
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:18,080
Global satellite transmission

Getting close to the 200

Happy time

1483
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,160
You know what I didn't realize everybody contenders a bigger fly

1484
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:09,280
444 on the biggest lie there's ever been 200 something radio station

1485
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
Commissioned by Justice absolute

1486
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
It's vague enough

1487
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,936
You know it means nothing

1488
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:22,592
So that might not be alive

1489
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,640
Blackjack on that one

1490
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,176
For sure

1491
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
It's a happy man

1492
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,016
I don't think anybody's ever said that ever

1493
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Didn't

1494
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
In German

1495
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,416
He's Hungarian butt

About time

1497
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
In the time of the Holocaust

1498
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
And he's discussing

1499
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
Support

1500
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Senior Old Navy

1501
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
Free because of the heroics

1502
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
His father

1503
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,704
Saving a bunch of

1504
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
People from going

1505
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Somehow that was at

1506
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,824
Invigorated like nothing could touch

1507
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,688
Even though the world is crumbling all around

1508
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:05,856
Re-watch those videos and found a couple new things

1509
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,256
Cuz he's also

1510
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,888
Man the 200 radio station so that's a number

1511
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:22,752
That's not true

1512
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,568
220

1513
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,664
Sure you did lie about whatever you want

1514
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,480
Are we all of them

1515
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,296
FM

1516
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
Knowledge fight

1517
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:44,000
You can find it everywhere on the dial everywhere 24/7 on every radio station

1518
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:48,096
Do those plugs because you can not find knowledge fight

1519
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,376
We're stupid

1520
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,400
We are

1521
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
Crazy everywhere

1522
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
So

1523
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
Mount Jordan we get to

1524
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,544
Guest guest

1525
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Is wild

1526
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,616
There's been a lot of bulshit

1527
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,896
Episode so far whether it's

1528
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
Misrepresenting mythology

1529
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
Whether it

1530
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,040
Really teasing out the entire episode that

1531
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,160
Which I know we're laughing about now but unfortunately

1532
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,976
I do foresee a world where

1533
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
Far beyond the pale on Fortune

1534
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
But now we get a guest

1535
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Is real weird

1536
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,984
Real strange cast for Alex to have on

1537
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:31,872
Are we got surprised

1538
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,784
A while but

1539
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,904
Books by Brian cam.com

1540
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
5 high

1541
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:58,240
Then I saw him

1542
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
Tool Cover the Waterfront

1543
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,992
Where is this the world we are right now

1544
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
The best

1545
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,912
Smell bad to an Alex Jones call I think we've ever had

1546
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:31,776
Do you know who hotep Jesus

1547
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Who

1548
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,152
He's the guy who went into Starbucks

1549
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,688
Is reparation coffee

1550
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
That's pretty funny

1551
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,320
And all that happened was

1552
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,856
Someone was really nice to him

1553
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,952
Starbucks coffee

1554
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,000
There was no real

1555
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
The real Point made by it I don't

1556
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,096
Starbucks was expressing

1557
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
Commence Wakefield

1558
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,680
If I remember correctly by opinion

1559
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
Just go

1560
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:08,384
I understand that but there was a certain

1561
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
There's a certain level of like

1562
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Alright

1563
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
Starbucks hours

1564
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
The policy of

1565
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,000
Did they want a cup of coffee you supposed to give it to him

1566
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Because that's good

1567
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
PR more lies are good for the community

1568
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,400
Coffee cost

1569
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
$0

1570
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,496
So he went viral video

1571
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,896
He's so obsessed with being viral

1572
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:44,480
Thrilled to have someone who is not white

1573
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,576
Right is he still living with his

1574
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,904
Did he go

1575
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
There's a

1576
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,304
Put out a video

1577
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Catching back up

1578
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,656
With Mike Rotondo

1579
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,448
VH1

1580
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,776
Now living with

1581
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,080
A lady who allows them to live there

1582
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
Exchange for doing like yard work

1583
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,968
I don't know

1584
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:19,040
I don't want to disparage anybody seems like she's very nice lady

1585
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,624
The reasons I think I will never have him

1586
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,648
Turn back on

1587
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,696
Because in these vices video

1588
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
The lady is being interviewed in front of her

1589
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
House

1590
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,072
And she has a blessed Ramadan sign

1591
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:37,472
So now Mike Rotondo has been taken in by a very generous Muslim

1592
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
So

1593
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,992
It's very mysterious what happened to that $3,000

1594
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:54,880
He was going to do was going to move in with that guy

1595
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
Well of course

1596
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,256
So better

1597
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:03,840
That was gross this is where my interested in Mike Rotondo

1598
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
Saga has

1599
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:11,008
Far exceeded its expiration date Islam that would be the best

1600
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,032
Comes back on

1601
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,336
Salaam alaikum

1602
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,152
Kalevala

1603
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,968
Hotep Jesus

To get into and then we'll get into

1605
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,088
But we got to do one thing for the internet today

1606
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
Need to see me and you

1607
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
Side by side

1608
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:35,072
Screaming and raging at the globalist man can you do that for me man

1609
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Sure

1610
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:42,240
How is my voice

01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:55,040
I love you

1612
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
You owe me to come

1613
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:19,872
Yeah that's how I feel when I come off my parents cuz I got that Ali's jewelry

1614
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:33,184
We need that that movement lacks passion did you bring passion and I love you

1615
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:50,592
Super siah

1616
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:57,504
Dragon Ball Z

1617
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,088
Goku and Super Saiyan in his first fight again

1618
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,112
Frieza

1619
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:07,488
Is very important then is the series went on there were different levels of Super Saiyan

1620
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:10,304
Dragon Ball super witch

1621
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,608
Is the new version of that there was a two

1622
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,888
God level

1623
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
It's a really

1624
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,448
Convoluted

1625
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Situation

1626
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
Fantastic

1627
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
Just go out there

1628
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,384
Sonic

1629
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,832
What does -1 Super Sonic and Super Shadow

1630
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:40,256
Also I'm installing a tiny bit because it's really funny that all this comes up be

1631
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Because on

1632
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,816
Hotep Jesus is website

1633
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,096
He has an article

1634
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,216
May 18th of this year

1635
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,776
Title policy is liberal bulshit

1636
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,640
No Dragon Ball series teaches valuable life lesson

1637
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,624
Watching Dragon Ball series Life Lesson Nostalgia every episode of inside a hidden esoteric

1638
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
Jim's

1639
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:10,720
Allow me to provide a high-level overview of what's

1640
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Gohan

1641
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
Yes that's

1642
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,560
Goku Son

1643
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:18,400
Luxury of being homeschooled until he's of high-school age

1644
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,704
What's the condition of the public school systems

1645
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,336
Thanks to his mother chichi

1646
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
Father Goku

1647
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,320
After proving his power and his victory over self he finds it important to me education

1648
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:42,208
He actually didn't win against al he went Super Saiyan level 2 but it was once again

1649
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,744
A Spirit Bomb that defeated

1650
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,816
Now it's talk about Vegeta

1651
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,608
Yes let's talk about

1652
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,144
This guy is my favorite

1653
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
Inspire

1654
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,032
This guy trains Non-Stop

1655
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,128
Before the Android so I got bloomer

1656
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,712
Yeah

1657
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,016
Best way to Rue Morgue

1658
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:12,416
Yeah but you would not be able to stand up in this room let alone train with a machine

1659
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:17,280
300 * gravity

1660
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,680
He was doing push-ups

1661
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,008
This is important in the context of his own

1662
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,824
Because the only reason that Vegeta did this

1663
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
Was because Goku

1664
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:36,736
Did the same thing on his spaceship flight over to the planet

1665
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Alright

1666
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:43,136
When he was going to fight and that is

1667
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:46,208
The Virginia was just trying to catch up

1668
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,024
Jealous little b**** that's what's going on there

1669
01:32:55,424 --> 01:33:01,568
Is the series protagonist in Japan's Mickey Mouse

1670
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,664
He's not there yet I think

1671
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
Pikachu is still

1672
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:14,368
By the way

1673
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:21,792
Relentlessly positive character

1674
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:27,680
By the way

1675
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,520
Naive idiot

1676
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,824
Oh no

1677
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
A little

1678
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,152
That beer was a little loaded there I

1679
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
You dropped this door too easily and he is a naive idiot

1680
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:43,296
But you have to respect his gangster comes to fighting

1681
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:47,136
He wants to fight anyone and everyone to prove his Supremacy as a fighter

1682
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,440
After Krillin dies for the second time but the hands

1683
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
The freezer

1684
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:54,816
We see Goku turn Super Saiyan Goku has the unique drive to consistently reach New Heights

1685
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
He's always pushing the envelope

1686
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,984
You're only as good as your last fight

1687
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,264
Parenthetically accomplishment

1688
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
Sometimes

1689
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:08,128
Today

1690
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
What is the next

1691
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,688
Achievement what height are you reach

1692
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,760
How do you feel about that

1693
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:20,672
Rosetta track with your understanding

1694
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:30,912
Piccolo's very interesting

1695
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,240
Because he's trying to save the universe

1696
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,544
We wish back

1697
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
Doesn't have a mask

1698
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:44,992
Piccolo steps

1699
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:56,000
I'm going to read this entire helping

1700
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
But it's

1701
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,072
Let's go home

1702
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,096
The plan to work as a team

1703
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,680
Foreign concept for Goku and Vegeta

1704
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:09,568
You have the energy and the elders have the experiences

1705
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,128
Whether you create an Unstoppable Force

1706
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,944
Set bad example for the Next Generation

1707
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Especially on social media

1708
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,992
Which is very real

1709
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,904
Dragonball irrelevant

1710
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:32,864
We need to Holy Ship has nothing to do with Piccolo

1711
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:40,800
There's six more paragraphs

1712
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:47,456
Alright he's going to knock on her

1713
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,528
She is like a stereotypic she's like that

1714
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,344
Ideal

1715
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,440
Of all the characters cheese probably the most growl

1716
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
Well others are distracted with training

1717
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,304
Aliens

1718
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,376
Other bills that to be paid and kids have an education

1719
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:09,728
She's what's missing from so many families in America today

1720
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:16,128
With feminism pulling women out of the home and into the workforce there's no one at home to attend to the

1721
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,432
Naked photo

1722
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:24,064
The care and attention they need

1723
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,392
It's gender roles that hold the family together is a solid

1724
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
Chichi was no pushover

1725
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
The only person

1726
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
Can intimidate Goku

1727
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,536
Jenna salt rifles and submachine guns

1728
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,560
Parenthetical

1729
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,728
I don't think I'm going to Merica

1730
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:50,176
I know I just realized I know

1731
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:53,248
She was no slouch and could fight with Beth

1732
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,040
They never got the waiver

1733
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
Is a woman

1734
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,344
Skip Goku checked

1735
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,648
In grounded

1736
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
A vital role

1737
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,208
Creating

1738
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
How is this

1739
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
What do you think about

1740
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,608
Freezer

1741
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,752
Frieza literally wanted to destroy the world for his own power there's no way

1742
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,056
Itsfunneh

1743
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:23,456
Sometimes I write a book

1744
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:28,320
Not be allowed to transition off his rambling about Dragon Ball

1745
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,136
So you've written a book

1746
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,208
His real name

1747
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,024
He's written a book called quote Twitter marketing

1748
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,584
How to build a cult-like following

1749
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,984
A promises to teach you how to quote every time

1750
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,544
How to network with influencers for your benefit

1751
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,592
How to manipulate Twitter algorithm

1752
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:53,152
Although he misspelled algorithms in the

1753
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
For the buck

1754
01:37:54,944 --> 01:38:00,576
This is the same as like Dave Seaman vlogger turn Bitcoin hack who had previously written a book all that had

1755
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
Create a news Buzz

1756
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,160
These people at their core Allstate

1757
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
You buy that

1758
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:13,376
Maybe we could get the better quit attraction I think we would end up losing a bunch

1759
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Marcel's in it

1760
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,752
I like that diversion because it's fun to yell about his

1761
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,056
Rambling about Dragon Ball but

1762
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,592
What's more important

1763
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,640
Look at this guy as a as a

1764
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,176
So I will

1765
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:28,992
The Navy wants to go by his hotep Jesus

1766
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:31,552
Even though his name is Brian Sharp soil refer to

1767
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,136
Website hotep Jesus

1768
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,928
Hotep lifestyle memes

1769
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
To him as best I can tell

1770
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,536
It's pretty much just about black nationalist working together with whitener

1771
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,144
You know it's bad when I'd rather align with erasers

1772
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
Crybaby black

1773
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,216
This is not really new

1774
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:53,824
David Duke and Louis Farrakhan respect each other's desire for their respective races to live

1775
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,384
It's not really a new

1776
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,944
Like it's not a novel perspective to have

1777
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,504
But he's just trying to merge black nationalism with white

1778
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,320
Right because they would be a lot more powerful

1779
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
Forced together

1780
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,744
I'm going to go with

1781
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:17,120
I will say inconclusive as to whether or not they would be far more powerful force

1782
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
Working together

1783
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:20,192
There was a way for them that's their leader

1784
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,800
It would distract a lot of people

1785
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:28,896
Running Fred Hampton was the last person to try and do that and he got murdered

1786
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,504
But I don't think it was necessarily strict black nationalism and white Nash

1787
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,808
He was trying to bring together

1788
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:42,208
I mean he was trying to do that but under the Aegis of hey let's not do that right

1789
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,328
Another post to find hotep which is a term for a license

1790
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
Regrouping hotep is not

1791
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
Just like I

1792
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,472
Like I thought it was

1793
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,800
Another place to find totep is being all about strength

1794
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,848
Nuclear black family

1795
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,128
Specifically defined as a

1796
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
Child

1797
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:08,320
It's really strange just like just like what he says

1798
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,344
Hey

1799
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,160
I didn't get this from Rodger Stone

1800
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
A caveat

1801
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,280
An argument against you

1802
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:22,144
All we care about is the black nuclear family

1803
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,680
Man woman child

1804
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:32,128
You know there are about

1805
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:39,040
Why would you I just don't understand how those two things match up whatever you want to say

1806
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,856
Also the hotel

1807
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,672
Denotes a black nationalist new religious movement

1808
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,952
Emerged

1809
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,488
Basically

1810
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,512
About

1811
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,048
Afrocentric version of the

1812
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,632
Pharaohs were black

1813
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,448
So it goes back to it

1814
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,544
Africa

1815
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,152
But all this is a spiritualist

1816
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,224
This is like an esoteric movement

1817
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,528
It involves a lot of

1818
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,856
Alex isn't taking into account like all of the other things

1819
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,672
His name being hotep Jesus

1820
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,976
And what he's involved in

1821
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,256
Outside of politics

1822
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,560
Looks like the religiosity of the key potatoes

1823
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:26,400
What Alex

1824
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
Isn't it

1825
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,240
This guy is close to like the Lost Children of Babylon

1826
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
The nuwaubian

1827
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
Like those shorts

1828
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,176
First off give me the 5%

1829
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,760
But it's not exactly

1830
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,296
Second

1831
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
I don't think that Jarvis

1832
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,880
Much with Alex

1833
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
Really

1834
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,488
Because it because

1835
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:55,840
It just like we just like we were just like you

1836
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:59,168
All of his fears were about what if this happened to White

1837
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,216
Right

1838
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,776
Fall of hotep's ideas are like

1839
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,568
You do you

1840
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,128
Leave us the f*** alone

1841
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,688
Let's do let's do that

1842
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:16,832
Yeah like he's only afraid of black people

1843
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,648
If there's the idea that there's an encroachment

1844
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,928
Upon his

1845
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,464
Whatever it

1846
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,256
And if they're fine with his

1847
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:29,632
If you're fine with me being a white nationalist and you just don't like like don't live near me

1848
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,680
Then you can believe whatever the f*** you want

1849
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,104
And he's sitting

1850
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,432
Tony said it over and over again doesn't want to be made to feel bad

1851
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:45,760
You don't want to feel bad about the bigotry that lives within the car

1852
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
I want to be a big

1853
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,832
Distance

1854
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:54,720
I don't want to see those Muslim women at the pool

1855
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,512
Eggplant

1856
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,792
Exactly hate them

1857
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,120
Steady

1858
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,472
Hotep Jesus does not seem like a great guy

1859
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,752
Do you have any interest

1860
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,312
Call the United right rally in Charlottesville

1861
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,128
Is there was no anti-protest there

1862
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,664
Are there would have been no class

1863
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,736
DeAndre Harris wouldn't be hurt and Heather hair wouldn't have been murder

1864
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,504
Fat

1865
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
I mean

1866
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,624
0 contacts

1867
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,000
Factual individuals who were killed

1868
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
Antiproton

1869
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
But they would

1870
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
All be heard

1871
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,960
More protests

1872
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,752
Generali's happen

1873
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:42,848
What you just said was if the Jews live in Germany

1874
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,384
They wouldn't have been holic

1875
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,944
There's something there's there's some similarities

1876
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
So he's also appeared on the show called Red Ice

1877
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
TV

1878
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,832
Does the show run by Henrik palmgren

1879
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,368
Is a Swedish whiteness

1880
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:58,464
National League

1881
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,280
Palmgren

1882
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,304
Denying vlogger

1883
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:06,656
Red Ice in the last month has put out videos with titles like quote do they want you

1884
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,936
You dead white man

1885
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,288
Interracial relationships are pushed on white women

1886
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,384
Weirdly tutorial on how to make beef jerky that is still somehow race

1887
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,688
I watched it very weird

1888
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344
This is the white whale

1889
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
It's very weird

1890
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:30,976
I just don't pull it look if you pull this Jamaican jerk chicken

1891
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,256
That's not even jerky

1892
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:38,656
I didn't tell you the right now that's like a combination of spices of like

1893
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,936
Cooking tutorials

1894
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,472
This one was like

1895
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,520
Coolest dresses

1896
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:50,432
I recommend everyone go watch it I think you'll agree with me

1897
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,736
Feels backed up

1898
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:56,832
So nice

1899
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
She isn't real

1900
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,880
Actually a plot of the

1901
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
Quote

1902
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,952
Is it always comes back

1903
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,816
The only thing that makes white supremacy I thought people mind

1904
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,376
Is the media and the media is controlled by who

1905
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,144
Should've been home

1906
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,960
The only thing that makes his music

1907
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,264
That's controlled by who should've been home

1908
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,640
The movies Hollywood who controls that

1909
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:23,968
We talked about people got sold out

1910
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,504
Well who controls these Banks

1911
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,576
It's off-limits.

1912
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,368
It's already know that my country United States

1913
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,672
America is going to become an Islamic judelle.

1914
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
Dominick's steak

1915
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
School

1916
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
I don't think

1917
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,584
Islam that he's

1918
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,352
Afraid of

1919
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
Is Cool Whip

1920
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,424
The LGB

1921
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,984
That he's also afraid of

1922
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:49,312
He's afraid of a lot guys just kind of like

1923
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
Set down

1924
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,640
Like really worked out

1925
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:57,760
The fears that they have are the Venn diagrams that they exist

1926
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
You know

1927
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:04,672
Like I'm cool if you're I'm not cool I'm just saying like

1928
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:11,072
Ideologically afraid of Muslims I don't like because

1929
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,864
No that doesn't happen

1930
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,632
For a very specific

1931
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,448
These people aren't interested

1932
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,472
First aid in reality

1933
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,776
That's very interested in spreading a fee

1934
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,824
Look as if they'd if it is okay

1935
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,872
You sit down and think about

1936
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,152
What am I advocating

1937
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,432
Does this make sense

1938
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,968
Does

1939
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,368
Does does a b and c of the things I'm afraid of could we possibly coexist interstate I should be

1940
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Be afraid

1941
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:37,184
He would have to sit back and be like

1942
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,976
I got to get a better Rock You

1943
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:43,584
Nek not happening

1944
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
It's about

1945
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:51,008
Brandon's about getting a cult-like Twitter following it's about what he wrote a f****** book

1946
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
We should read that book

1947
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,824
Did write a book

1948
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
About culture

1949
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,152
You didn't write a book about how it's important

1950
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:00,224
To free yourself from the shackles of

1951
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,504
The globalist

1952
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
Or whatever

1953
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,552
You wrote a book

1954
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,904
Bryant.com

1955
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,696
Bryan

1956
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,280
To look for books by Brian fell braai

1957
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,840
Just a

1958
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,656
Different Brian brain brain

1959
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
No Brian

1960
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:23,008
You said

1961
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:30,688
If you go to that it's a Amazon books

1962
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:35,296
But like the book that he's selling that he's trying

1963
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,832
To push is about getting attention

1964
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,368
It's not about the

1965
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,648
The substantiv issues

1966
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,672
That leaves

1967
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,208
That's what he's more interested

1968
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,280
Time spreading

1969
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,840
Very deeply bigoted

1970
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,632
Or

1971
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,008
If you are a

1972
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
You get that

1973
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:59,616
Attention of the cult-like

1974
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:06,016
Well yes he's credited all the time he was on Laura Ingraham show use credit as a comedian

1975
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,856
Stand-up comedy

1976
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:13,952
We should find the check

1977
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
To that point

1978
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,560
If you are

1979
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
Black

1980
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,728
Looking to get as much viral attention as you

1981
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
You possibly can

1982
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,800
For taking the position

1983
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,616
That people who have

1984
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
Power

1985
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,808
In order to take advantage of the fact that you are black saying all of them

1986
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:42,880
Discredit the actual voices who are working

1987
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,184
For the people the workers of the world

1988
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
You working class

1989
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:53,888
Alexandra

1990
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,656
Anacortes

1991
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:57,216
Alexandria Alexandria

1992
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,752
Alexandria Cortez

1993
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
Okay zi Cortez

1994
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,824
They took her winning

1995
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
This race

1996
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
In order for people to ask

1997
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:06,688
We talked about her in the media

1998
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,992
The intercept

1999
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:12,064
It was like in the rest of the world was like

2000
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:18,720
We don't need the actual winning of the primary race in order for it to become a voice that

2001
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:19,744
But if

2002
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
You go this route

2003
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,072
Very easy

2004
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,864
Still get attention

2005
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,424
Make millions of dollars

2006
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,496
If you're running scam you can find your niche

2007
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:37,152
You know like you can find it Jesus wrote a blog post called anti-racism is worse than racism

2008
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:40,480
Why Dragon Ball Z

2009
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:44,576
Are you says quote what's the wrong with white people saying White lives matter

2010
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:48,160
If you say black lives matter doesn't that open the door for its antithesis

2011
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,440
Now this is dumb

2012
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:58,400
Because it's pretty amazing that you can't understand

2013
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:03,776
Spider with a that is not the lives matter

2014
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:07,360
Right right

2015
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
No way was better argument

2016
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:22,464
GoNoodle

2017
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:29,376
White people scream white power White lives matter black people get offended I don't

2018
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
I'm proud of these whites

2019
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,728
It's self-determination and I'll gladly applied any group that

2020
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,008
Xzibit self-determination

2021
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,544
My Counterpoint

2022
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:43,200
Is the historically people who yell white power or also the ones who are really black

2023
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:49,344
So it doesn't usually mean like I love being white and I like to celebrate eat a brat

2024
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,368
It's not

2025
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,904
It's usually

2026
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,976
Power against you

2027
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,536
Usually the people who are throwing in

2028
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Which

2029
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
To that point

2030
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:06,752
Griezmann

2031
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:11,360
Just introduced maybe lynching should be a hate crime bill

2032
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,408
2018

2033
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:18,272
Already been on that one a long time ago

2034
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,648
This group

2035
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,928
Didn't show up in Charlottesville

2036
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,208
The truth is none of us would

2037
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,232
We'll be talkin about Charlotte

2038
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,280
If you picture white nationalist

2039
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:32,096
Sapphire anti-protest group

2040
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,400
My Counterpoint to that is

2041
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,704
Nope

2042
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:43,360
Or you could say if you picture of

2043
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,152
As a fire

2044
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
Then white supremacist are the people who are

2045
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:53,088
Before the Charlottesville rally there was a talking Nazis yelling blood and soil and Randy

2046
01:51:55,648 --> 01:52:00,000
Tiki torches and what-have-you what are the gator shirts

2047
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,048
Crocs

2048
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
God

2049
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,448
This really doesn't take him too

2050
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,240
The consideration that what happens

2051
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
With

2052
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
Movement

2053
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
Like

2054
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,312
Fascism

2055
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,664
Is that when it's unopposed

2056
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,432
Escape Routes

2057
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,968
And when is embolden

2058
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:20,992
It it gets

2059
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:21,760
The foothold

2060
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
And when that happened

2061
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,576
Everyone gets hurt

2062
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,856
Why people get hurt

2063
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,880
Black people get hurt

2064
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,416
Days get hard

2065
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,952
51

2066
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:30,720
Spectrum guitar

2067
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,536
And the historically

2068
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:37,632
Yeah I should say robot

2069
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,936
This thing about that

2070
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:40,960
That is

2071
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,496
Really really important

2072
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,776
In terms of like that

2073
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
Don't feed the

2074
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
Controls Naruto

2075
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,592
Is

2076
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,616
It is

2077
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,176
Tiny part of America

2078
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,480
Out-and-out White

2079
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,576
But because they have gained such a foothold

2080
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,112
The Republican

2081
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,136
Block them

2082
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,184
But because they're associated with that

2083
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,208
Are playing the teams

2084
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,024
Like my parents are not

2085
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,048
Really

2086
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,328
Because they don't even understand

2087
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:12,960
But they're on the team their de facto so they're like

2088
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,312
Well yeah of course we support all these white supremacist because we're not on your team

2089
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,360
Your team has to be wrong

2090
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:24,480
So I mean yeah. Now we're ourselves into

2091
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
Supporting this thing

2092
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:30,624
And we can't get away from exactly

2093
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,208
Jumped a foothold and the foothold was all it took

2094
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,256
NAU

2095
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:39,840
Situation that's why the anti-protest like the protesting

2096
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,888
Rap groups

2097
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Arson

2098
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,728
Are crucial because they are the people who are there were saying

2099
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,032
No this isn't okay

2100
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,080
Those people need to be

2101
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
Rebuke

2102
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,896
Did every turn

2103
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:04,160
And overtake our entire country dialogue with

2104
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:09,024
That allows us to communicate and

2105
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Sherp

2106
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,424
Who hotep Jesus is

2107
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Twitter

2108
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,240
Buzz Market

2109
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,264
Scam

2110
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
Kind of guy who sells a book about that stuff

2111
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,080
Which is

2112
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,968
It tells you how you can use

2113
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:31,040
Influencers for your advantage

2114
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:35,648
Being like hey wouldn't be great if we yelled together is exactly him doing that

2115
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:42,048
Oh yeah in a way that's probably spelled out in his book

2116
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:46,656
And use it as a selling point for his book

2117
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,680
Hustle

2118
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,984
Pitching list

2119
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,288
Black nationalism and white nationalism

2120
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:55,360
Should merge and then we can all live separately hating each other

2121
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,920
Which I find very unkind

2122
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,200
Pleasanton

2123
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,248
That's a unattractive future

2124
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,552
I did I am going to go with

2125
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,832
He's being disingenuous

2126
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,648
Stupid

2127
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,792
Is the

2128
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:17,632
If you look at what they provide for women.

2129
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,216
The only thing they provide for women are prenatal vitamins

2130
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,008
The rent is abortion

2131
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,312
They should just call it the abortion clinic

2132
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:29,408
They're not planning any Parenthood

2133
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:36,832
That's what they do with the baby

2134
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:43,232
Body parts

2135
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,792
Black babies and black people do I'm short back

2136
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,376
I don't know how I don't know how you can make money

2137
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:55,520
I don't know what the black community would like to make all black baby is I don't understand

2138
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
I don't know

2139

Six fingers like what are you hoping to make off of your life baby

Broad question

2166
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,328
Interesting

2167
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,656
I suppose I suppose it is the

2168

Do you like

Feather in the cap

2170

White races

2171
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,336
Trying to be racist

2172
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
While supporting races

2173
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,992
Like

2174
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
Did you know the Planned Parenthood

2175
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:53,536
Yeah

2176
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
Like

Charter

2182
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:08,896
In some way

2183
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,432
The people are forced into it

2184
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:14,016
Ludacris and that's brilliant

2185
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:17,344
Dumb thing to say because that it's wages the

2186
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:20,160
Am I racist I think I am

2187
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,952
That white racist have

2188
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
What's a cat

2189
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:26,560
Package of believe that you already have because you're mad and hey

2190
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:30,400
Which is now your repackage

2191
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
Also I'm Pro black

2192
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:38,848
What is the god saying that

2193
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,640
That's what it is

2194
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:43,200
It's all over again. Like

2195
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:46,016
That like you don't understand

2196
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,808
It makes them happier

2197
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:54,208
If there's already isn't God's will

2198
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:57,792
Don't don't fall into this trap of like

2199
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:02,912
Oh yeah

2200
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
It's racist

2201
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:10,592
And it's all couched in this language of like you're being neither of those well that's an interesting approach

2202
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,872
Because the truth of this

2203
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:17,504
Hotep Jesus

2204
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,040
They publicized

2205
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
Statistics

2206
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,904
Specifically to attack Library.

2207
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:29,024
Well it's true that our report came out covering the time 2014-2015

2208
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,072
The reported from 8

2209
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,352
Planned Parenthood location

2210
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,376
That were surveyed

2211
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,680
17419 in

2212
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,728
Prenatal Services were reported

2213
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,496
However

2214
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,544
It does take into account of that

2215
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,592
Not all the locations

2216
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,152
This country are equipped to provide prenatal care

2217
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,968
That is not really the primary function

2218
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,248
Planned Parenthood offers

2219
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:51,296
And it is never claimed

2220
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,832
To be thought what they offer

2221
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:56,928
Is only thing is available at certain Planned Parenthood locations

2222
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:57,696
But have these

2223
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,768
Pacific doctors and the resources

2224
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:06,656
In order to afford prenatal care

2225
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,264
Further these statistics are classic case of

2226
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:18,432
Assuming that the 7419 number does cover all the prenatal care the plant paradox

2227
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,992
The report was only covering a

2228
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
Some of the

2229
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,040
Location

2230
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
It was like

2231
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
8 out of the 56

2232
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
Survey survey

2233
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:29,952
I said they're probably more than that in the

2234
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:31,232
The country but it wasn't

2235
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:35,328
Caught up in there yeah yeah

2236
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:39,168
A height of approximately

2237
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,472
324,000 abortions

2238
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,008
Reported in that timeframe

2239
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,592
Which

2240
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,128
To assert the prenatal care Zone

2241
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:48,896
Only 5%

2242
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,432
Are the services offered by Planned Parenthood

2243
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:54,272
What you trying to do is get the listener to assume that abortion must

2244
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,552
Be most of what they are

2245
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Is not true

2246
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,184
He even admits when he's talking about that the report was like the Planned Parenthood offer.

2247
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,208
3.5 million

2248
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,280
To point out

2249
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
Different

2250
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,096
680 2000 cancer

2251
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,376
It almost

2252
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:11,424
3 million individual cases

2253
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Contraception

2254
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:13,984
These people

2255
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,264
Like Alex Jones

2256
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,800
Like hotep Jesus

2257
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:20,128
Who make these attacks on Planned Parenthood f****** know this

2258
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,432
They know damn well what abortion

2259
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:29,344
What plant what plant

2260
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,368
I did not because they say

2261
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,440
Sincerely want to get rid of abortion because Planned Parenthood offers

2262
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,464
Essential resource

2263
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,512
Whereby control their bodies

2264
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,536
Investor-owned life

2265
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,072
They use images of fetuses

2266
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,120
Sentara stories about Kermit Gosnell

2267
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:41,888
Purposeful

2268
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:44,448
Purely to further their real goal which is

2269
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:45,472
Depriving women of Asian

2270
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:48,544
So all this information that hotep Jesus

2271
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Does using

2272
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,592
From a group called live

2273
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,432
Abortion group started by

2274
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,968
Ginger old lilah-rose

2275
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,016
Who got her start posing as a prank

2276
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,296
Teenager

2277
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:01,088
Posing

2278
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:05,440
She pretended to be pregnant she was just half of it was true

2279
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:07,232
She was pregnant

2280
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,048
I bet she would be on the other side

2281
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:14,656
I bet you wouldn't be going on with Jim's Okies both it

2282
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:15,680
Fascinating

2283
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:17,984
Yes probably

2284
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:26,432
Keith made a couple of videos and then she met a guy named David

2285
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:32,832
We talked about before

2286
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,112
Completely tricks

2287
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,136
Fake nails

2288
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,952
Director of r

2289
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,000
That's not good

2290
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:44,096
The work of these involved parties occasion

2291
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,680
The finished product

2292
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,448
Is always

2293
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,216
Complete

2294
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:50,240
Presentation of the raw food

2295
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:52,288
As

2296
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,824
Many people also

2297
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,384
Beyond courts even like some of this is just people who

2298
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,152
All the Raw

2299
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
Footage

2300
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,200
Yeah they're like this is

2301
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:01,760
We not the case you're misrepresenting everything

2302
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:04,320
Yeah that's the case with with lights

2303
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
With that James O'Keefe

2304
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,624
Project Veritas

2305
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,392
Education

2306
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,672
Center for Medical progress

2307
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
It's all the same

2308
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:15,584
So misrepresented even if he wasn't getting

2309
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,120
Information very clearly from

2310
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:17,888
Anti-abortion

2311
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:18,912
Outlet

2312
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,216
He's still misrepresenting it

2313
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,496
In terms of like

2314
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,312
The main thing that Planned Parenthood is about

2315
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:27,104
Is preventive care

2316
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:32,480
They're not that they offer prenatal services in some places where they can

2317
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:33,504
But that's

2318
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:34,528
Not their main

2319
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,320
Like doctor

2320
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:40,672
That's for OBGYNs where they practice

2321
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,720
It's about preventative

2322
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,512
Care and when you look at the

2323
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
Almost

2324
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,328
3 million cases

2325
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,096
Is of contrast

2326
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:48,864
Septic services

2327
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
Is the offer

2328
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:51,680
When you look at it

2329
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:53,984
Via reproductive aspect of its 6

2330
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,752
T2000

2331
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
They're crucial for

2332
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
For cervical cancer

2333
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,456
Like the idea that you would

2334
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:09,600
He wants to talk about all this.

2335
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:16,256
What percent is the abortions when you have three hundred thousand or so abortion

2336
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:18,560
And it's three million contracept

2337
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,328
Give services

2338
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,120
3.5 million St

2339
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,912
680,000

2340
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,824
You don't want to talk about that

2341
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,616
Because that's not what you care about

2342
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,152
It's not what they care about

2343
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:35,200
Care about disenfranchising women

2344
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,480
And I know why

2345
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:37,760
It's because this mess

2346
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,576
Straight white men

2347
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,856
Straight black men

2348
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:44,416
Are under attack we have become

2349
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:48,256
Call Public Enemy Number One in the eyes of bee

2350
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:57,216
Protect people from the globalist

2351
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,752
Block out the paint

2352
02:04:59,008 --> 02:04:59,776
ASAP

2353
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,592
And they're using to do this

2354
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
Okay

2355
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,408
AR

2356
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:08,224
They're using

2357
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:10,528
Nobody's at

2358
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:11,808
Evercade

2359
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,344
Super Bowl of acknowledging that women

2360
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:20,768
Condescending just like

2361
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:21,792
Like it you could

2362
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:24,864
I mean here we are obvious

2363
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,144
Is like

2364
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:29,984
Well we don't want heaven we don't want women to have it

2365
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,032
You say that

2366
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:36,640
And that's exactly what their base wants to hear

2367
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,688
AA meeting would be interesting

2368
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:39,968
Cassie like what kind of

2369
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:42,272
Sport it would get into wooden pole grape

2370
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:46,880
Well I was

2371
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:52,000
Whatever it is B

2372
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,472
Regrettably

2373
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,664
You have just made me realize that

2374
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,456
Probably if you pulled

2375
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:14,016
A bunch of really painful thing like

2376
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:30,400
They would have 50% whatever whatever Jones got in his election what was it

2377
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:36,800
Is it like 57% of white women that's exactly how many women not being allowed to choose

2378
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:37,568
Who's on the good side

2379
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:42,944
Okay you talkin about that

2380
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:48,320
My bad

2381
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:51,136
Terra Vista

2382
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,464
I don't really f***** up

2383
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,536
See that I don't have anybody pulling

2384
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:59,328
Stop like the idea of like

2385
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:08,032
We should all live separately otherwise

2386
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,616
Seems like

2387
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,152
Pools

2388
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:15,200
Yeah because I imagine the numbers

2389
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:15,968
Pizza Hut

2390
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:16,736
Blue

2391
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
We wouldn't want to look at it

2392
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,296
Yeah can we

2393
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:22,112
Like let's not pull dog whistle questions

2394
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:28,512
Let's just pull the questions like why are we why are they

2395
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:37,472
Okay fine but they still killer

2396
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,032
I think he's dog whistle

2397
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:43,104
He's a little on Alex's show cuz he knows he's

2398
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:50,272
There's more people listening

2399
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:52,064
Is actual steps

2400
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,880
I think he's very clear

2401
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:55,904
I hate

2402
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:02,048
They're behind everything

2403
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,840
Merge

2404
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:06,400
So I don't think he's dog whistling at all

2405
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,168
Except again

2406
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,448
Being good

2407
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,544
Alex

2408
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,312
Existence

2409
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,360
Just just stop it

2410
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:18,688
And everybody's proven that there

2411
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,712
Gohan

2412
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:22,784
What is Atlantis real

2413
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,832
Because I guarantee that

2414
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,880
Yeah just like it just like I'm saying

2415
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:32,000
50 / 7% of white women are like I'm against white women being able to choose

2416
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:34,304
We should be in the home barefoot and pregnant

2417
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,632
I mean what else do you say

2418
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,936
Because you can't

2419
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:44,544
You can't possibly believe that women should have the right to choose anything

2420
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:47,104
If you're voting for the people you're voting

2421
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:49,664
It just seemed

2422
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,736
Consider Lakers

2423
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:53,760
The willful

2424
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,320
You know like

2425
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:03,744
You take it all away from it a little bit

2426
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:04,768
Hot-button

2427
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
Right

2428
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,584
Sprite

2429
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
It's a f******

2430
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Something

2431
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,056
There's just no communicate

2432
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,080
Do you can't do it

2433
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,616
You can't f****** do it

2434
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:21,408
Let's bail

2435
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,432
What's

2436
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:27,808
You and I you and I are officially seceding from the Union

2437
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
Knowledge fight

2438
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,136
Mileage

2439
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:34,976
Independent republics

2440
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:38,048
Apartment

2441
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:43,936
How do I register

2442
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,800
No idea

2443
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:49,824
Too late

2444
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:51,360
I don't want to call

2445
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,664
I want to know what he don't want to talk

2446
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,688
I just don't want to talk

2447
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:59,040
If we're going to do this we have to plan in advance I have to call him and hate that up a bully here

2448
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:02,112
Just call him out of the blue

2449
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,160
We set up a time we did the whole thing

2450
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:05,184
Look Dan

2451
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,952
You don't know how

2452
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:11,072
I have that first I have to call all the Jews

2453
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:11,840
Together

2454
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,144
They have to get into a meeting room

2455
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:19,264
Netanyahu's wife is there the corrupt mod

2456
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:22,336
So we have to do that whole thing then

2457
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:23,872
So

2458
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,992
This episode has been mostly Alex doing

2459
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,040
Is Edge play about the

2460
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
Supreme Court

2461
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:32,832
Microwave

2462
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,392
And we've ended up with the orgasm that is

2463
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928
Tano

2464
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:40,512
Certainly hope that is not what

2465
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:44,096
I think it'll probably be floated but

2466
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,888
Really hope everyone smart enough

2467
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,656
To be like

2468
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:47,424
La shutdown

2469
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,216
Not anymore that sucks

2470
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:51,264
GameStop not anymore

2471
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,312
I don't know everybody the coward underneath

2472
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,336
Nancy Pelosi

2473
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,360
I mean

2474
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,128
I say the world

2475
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:56,896
Can't get darker but

2476
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,784
Dan the world gets dark

2477
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,600
And that Dawn

2478
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,648
Surprisingly climate

2479
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:12,000
So the world will get very dark and then we will all be burned alive

2480
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,024
By the Light

2481
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,632
You brought up earlier the Central Park five

2482
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,912
Because

2483
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,704
Alehouse combat positive

2484
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,544
To hotep G

2485
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:27,872
Boy this is

2486
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:29,408
Wings Over

2487
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:39,648
And that and that and that

2488
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:43,744
Everybody does know Trump knows that's not true

2489
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:48,096
He knows it's not true

2490
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,632
For the most part

2491
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:51,936
For the most part

2492
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,544
Oh boy black

2493
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,616
I'd like to

2494
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:02,688
Call the black community that they were not allowed to live in his building

2495
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:06,016
I'd like to pull the black community that certainly

2496
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:11,392
Who are aware of the situation

2497
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:14,720
The first time the Trump ever was in the newspaper was

2498
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,512
Because the government

2499
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:19,328
Because Nixon's Department of Justice was like

2500
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:21,376
Well your

2501
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:23,936
Belmont housing

2502
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:26,240
Nixon

2503
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:31,360
Godfathers of red line she's gone too far

2504
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:36,736
But his whole career

2505
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,272
Over the years

2506
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,296
Over and over again

2507
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:42,624
Eugenics over about his dad being Superior in

2508
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,928
Stuff like that like the idea

2509
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:51,328
30 years ago black everybody just night

2510
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:56,960
Apartments Hayward Haven

2511
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,728
Hey

2512
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,824
You know what it is that it's that mentality that Alex

2513
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,360
Like it does complicate

2514
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,896
This is another point where I think

2515
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,432
We're going to have to just suck it up

2516
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:08,480
And swallow a brutal pill

2517
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:10,528
That is this hypocritical

2518
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:13,344
Because this still follows Alex Jones is belief in

2519
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,624
Free association

2520
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,904
So like I think

2521
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
He would say

2522
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:20,000
It's not racist that Trump doesn't want black people living in his building

2523
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,048
The right of free association

2524
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:25,376
If you're okay with them

2525
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:31,008
Snowbigdeal devil doesn't exist

2526
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:34,592
Cool Ellijay was terrible

2527
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,920
He did Kill

2528
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:43,808
And then I believe that

2529
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:52,512
Attempt to talk about modern-day Alex Jones I feel like

2530
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,816
None of us enjoy this all that much

2531
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,840
Mythology

2532
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:59,680
I will send

2533
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:02,496
I love it when he brings

2534
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,848
Sink your teeth into

2535
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:09,664
Not not just with research but with like

2536
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:16,320
Yearslong indep

2537
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:17,856
Breakdown

2538
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,304
He talks about Diageo

2539
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:28,864
He talks about how he was going around asking

2540
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,144
Looking for one

2541
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,704
Which is the myth

2542
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,984
About the origin

2543
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:40,896
It's so much fun whenever people pull that out because I know

2544
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,688
Translate

2545
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,480
Vet

2546
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:48,320
Absolutely not

2547
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,368
Weirdo

2548
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,952
Complete weirdo

2549
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,744
Masturbated the marketplace

2550
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,536
And like screaming people he was in

2551
02:14:57,792 --> 02:15:00,352
Cannibalism you didn't believe in private property rights

2552
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,376
Right

2553
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,168
Say f*** it out there weird

2554
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:06,240
And when he did the line that everyone missed

2555
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,568
Lea I'm going around looking for one honest man

2556
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,848
Would it really

2557
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:11,872
Translate

2558
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:14,944
Something that I would describe as what a crazy person

2559
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:18,016
He's walking around at night

2560
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
With a lantern

2561
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,320
Looking for a

2562
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,160
That's it

2563
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,000
The word for honest and just

2564
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,792
Is diakos

2565
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:30,816
It is not

2566
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:34,144
In that sense it is just entrepot which is

2567
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,680
I'm looking for a man

2568
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:41,568
Which is what you would pay like if you're caught out somewhere where you're not supposed to be what are you doing

2569
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:46,944
Angry man

2570
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,992
I am looking for a man

2571
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:51,040
I just love all the time

2572
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,624
Like father

2573
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:56,160
Thrift

2574
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:58,208
F*** all this plan

2575
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,000
I don't care like I don't

2576
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:01,536
There's nothing for me to bunk

2577
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,816
To talk about inter

2578
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,608
Napolitano

2579
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,632
Supreme Court judge

2580
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:07,168
Other than Mustang

2581
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:15,360
Yeah because I don't know I don't know what steps or says he's going for obvious he's just talking to Rodger Stone

2582
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,896
Conversations with Rodger Stone

2583
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:17,920
Useless

2584
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:24,320
All I can do that it's like him saying that Arpaio is up

2585
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:27,648
Supreme Court judge

2586
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:29,184
Right there's no

2587
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:29,952
There's no

2588
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,768
We don't have a bottom

2589
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:36,096
Know you of the past

2590
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:37,120
Can we go over the Paw

2591
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:39,168
The value of it is

2592
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,192
That we get

2593
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:40,960
To have

2594
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:41,984
Distance

2595
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,008
We get to have time

2596
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:44,544
From his married

2597
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:45,568
So we can

2598
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:46,592
How things have

2599
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
Play doubt

2600
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:48,128
Is this

2601
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:50,688
Was he completely full of s***

2602
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,736
We can find the things

2603
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:53,760
He was referencing

2604
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:56,064
We can see how it all worked out we can

2605
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:03,744
There is that like

2606
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,512
Respective week

2607
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:06,560
You can take on it where is modern day stuff

2608
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,096
Like

2609
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:11,424
We run into an issue where he's lying all the time

2610
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,960
We know it's what he does

2611
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,008
No

2612
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,800
What are you saying all this stuff that we can

2613
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:18,336
Prove or disprove

2614
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,104
Prove

2615
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,384
It's this mid-ground on

2616
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,688
Where was like alright he's

2617
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:29,600
It is

2618
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:31,136
Sharon the contrast

2619
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:35,744
Like every like if you are if you are preemptively

2620
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,096
Or perhaps even defensively saying that

2621
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:43,424
We are doing a disservice by covering

2622
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,216
The present because we're not

2623
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:50,848
I'm not at no you're not no you're not you're not saying that

2624
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:52,384
I mean just more like

2625
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,432
This is why we're not covering

2626
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
The present

2627
02:17:55,968 --> 02:18:00,064
Ivy like it is still important for us as a show to go back into the past

2628
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,112
Which provides context for the Press

2629
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:05,440
And then we can come back to the present what once a week

2630
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:08,000
Never end

2631
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:10,560
See what the difference is because you can just

2632
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:15,424
Hear it if you listen to this episode versus our last 2009 episode

2633
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,216
You will instantly know

2634
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,496
There's a huge difference

2635
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:20,544
And yet

2636
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:25,152
And here is where and that only gives you more ammunition

2637
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,968
There's some there's there is value to it

2638
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,504
Should never do it

2639
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,296
It is just a

2640
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:33,088
It's a situation where

2641
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:34,624
I'm a human being

2642
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,160
It's not like

2643
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,696
Pains me to listen to

2644
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:44,352
Yeah I think that a lot of people on the the Facebook group

2645
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:46,912
Have the impression in their head that it's

2646
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:48,448
I get

2647
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:49,984
Like

2648
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:52,800
All up in like I can't handle

2649
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:58,432
It bothers me to listen to modern-day Alex

2650
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:00,480
And it doesn't

2651
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:04,832
You know like I eat that's it I just feel like I listen to an episode like this

2652
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
And I have

2653
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,136
This this takes

2654
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:09,184
3 hours to listen

2655
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,232
Edit

2656
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,256
Makes even more time

2657
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:16,352
The only value

2658
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,376
Really

2659
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,144
Is like

2660
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,680
We met hotep Jesus

2661
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,496
Alex misrepresent

2662
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Mythology

2663
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,824
Like beyond all the other stuff is just

2664
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,384
Yelling into the void nonsense

2665
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:29,408
It's just

2666
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:33,760
Sound and Fury signifying nothing

2667
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:35,040
No totally

2668
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:40,160
Why can't we yell into the void with the guy was yelling at the boys like f****** Goku

2669
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,440
Here's why

2670
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:43,488
Because it's repetitive

2671
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:48,096
About over and over

2672
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:49,632
Still trying to do a show

2673
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,656
And what it's like

2674
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:51,680
He says

2675
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:52,960
Like

2676
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,008
The globalists are

2677
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:58,336
Central Banking cartel's blah blah blah

2678
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
We could we've already talked about this

2679
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:01,664
Yeah we can we can

2680
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,688
Do it again

2681
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:04,224
If you want I want novel

2682
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:06,784
I want to learn and I want more like

2683
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:09,344
Content for the show right

2684
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,624
Joy as much

2685
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:12,928
I don't mind what

2686
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,488
Covering it from X

2687
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,256
The time

2688
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,024
But like

2689
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,584
Hours of my day

2690
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,120
F****** waste

2691
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,400
When I look into

2692
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,960
Like the other episodes that I listen to the cover

2693
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:30,592
That's a that's a three-hour waste of my time I totally get it

2694
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:34,688
I I can I'm not mad about that

2695
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,736
Embarrassing that's with Alyssa

2696
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:39,808
I'm not

2697
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,344
Is long enough that I know

2698
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:45,696
Feel the same way about

2699
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:46,976
The right-wing

2700
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:47,744
Outrage

2701
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,072
Like anytime I read the news where it's like

2702
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,400
Fox News said I'm out I don't give a s***

2703
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:55,424
If they're boring

2704
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,264
They're boring to me because they're just going to say if you if you

2705
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:03,616
If you were like what's your Fox news headline I'll be like

2706
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,176
Is evil because blank

2707
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:10,016
And liberals backlight

2708
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:14,880
I understand that, exactly

2709
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,440
Here's a further

2710
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,232
You really taken

2711
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,256
Federation

2712
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,048
Alex Jones

2713
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,072
In his world

2714
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:26,144
What is marketing

2715
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:28,704
Izzy has to be under

2716
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,240
Really great way of putting it

2717
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,264
He has to be understood

2718
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:33,568
There always has to be a threat

2719
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:34,592
Can't sell his ship

2720
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:36,384
In the same way that like

2721
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,944
Disaster supplies

2722
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:39,712
And stuff like that

2723
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:43,296
If the end actually sell a Year's worth of food though

2724
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:45,344
Yes he does

2725
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:51,488
Billy Salyers where the food

2726
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:54,816
You asked for it on the show anymore

2727
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:59,168
Not the same shape

2728
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:05,056
Jim Bakker remix

2729
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:07,360
I Choose You Baker

2730
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:10,944
This is Jim Bakker episode

2731
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,480
Special

2732
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:14,528
The Khan of

2733
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,064
Disaster prepared

2734
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,344
Only works

2735
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,624
Until the disaster

2736
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:22,208
Like once it happens you no longer have a cash

2737
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,000
So

2738
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:27,328
V8 your disaster is shared the same way everybody else

2739
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,376
Like if you sell

2740
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:31,168
Survival radios and

2741
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,960
Jim Baker's big old

2742
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:35,008
Potato buckets and stuff like that

2743
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,056
If she goes down

2744
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:38,592
Your supply chain is bus

2745
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,384
Everything is destroyed

2746
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:41,408
Make money

2747
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:44,224
The gig is up and now you are left

2748
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,272
Billion

2749
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:49,600
Survival food rations you have at your Pleasant Valley

2750
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:54,720
Okay so the game

2751
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,000
You know these are fuc

2752
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:59,584
Acting awful reality or truth

2753
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:03,168
Vino not in their best in

2754
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,448
For disaster

2755
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:05,728
To actually happen

2756
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:08,032
It's only in their best interest

2757
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,312
People scared

2758
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,360
Is about to happen right

2759
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:16,224
Is that the game that I was just playing

2760
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:18,016
He's marketing paradigm

2761
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,296
Which I'm going to replace

2762
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:26,464
Perfect for real that is the perfect phrase to replace world

2763
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,232
Great Wave

2764
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:29,024
What

2765
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,840
Because he shifted his entire operation

2766
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,912
Trump is the king of the auntie globalist

2767
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,240
Isis

2768
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:41,824
He said he was a globalist

2769
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,944
Model

2770
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,712
To do now

2771
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:48,736
Is a mating

2772
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:51,040
But he has to do is

2773
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:53,856
A where you can

2774
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,880
But eight

2775
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:55,648
Maintenance

2776
02:23:57,184 --> 02:24:01,280
He plays this like gift get afraid of Alexandria ocasio-cortez

2777
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,328
Get get scared of that because

2778
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:04,096
Casinos

2779
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,144
Like on one level he knows

2780
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,448
The Democratic Socialist

2781
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:12,544
Membership

2782
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:13,568
Like that

2783
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,104
Torino's B like

2784
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:18,432
You know what a little bit down the road if there's more

2785
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:19,200
Democratic

2786
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:23,808
Yeah so he knows like let's get a little B

2787
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:25,088
Scared about Facebook

02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:26,624
Find get her killed

2789
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,184
Then that's going to

2790
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:31,744
-2 our address

2791
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:34,048
When I watch I've watched

2792
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:35,840
3 shows from this week

2793
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:37,376
Like trying to make this up

2794
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:39,680
Episode away from it with

2795
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,960
Is that he isn't

2796
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:41,984
Pathetic holding

2797
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,264
He's just

2798
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,800
Worse

2799
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:46,592
Then I've seen in here

2800
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:49,408
From him there is just a like

2801
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,480
In the past you said he doesn't know how to

2802
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:53,760
And that's

2803
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:54,784
That's probably

2804
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,832
In the fact that he's on

2805
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,112
In terms of

2806
02:24:58,624 --> 02:24:59,392
Control

2807
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:02,464
You don't know how

2808
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,072
He's

2809
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:09,120
It's real

2810
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:11,936
I'm having a very difficult time expressing this because

2811
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:13,472
What it comes down to is

2812
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:15,008
You have a conspiracy

2813
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,032
Propaganda

2814
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:17,312
Who's now

2815
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,592
His job is

2816
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:21,152
Keep the base

2817
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:23,712
Riled but maintain the status quo

2818
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,272
And it's

2819
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,856
Boring it's boring apathetic

2820
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,392
When I watch it I don't know I don't

2821
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:32,160
Do you know what

2822
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:34,976
Do you know it's fast

2823
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:35,744
Look

2824
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:39,840
If he wanted to live his

2825
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,120
Principles

2826
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:44,192
As we pretend we have over and over again

2827
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,240
He should be saying

2828
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,080
Kill Alexandria

2829
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:53,152
Ocasio-cortez

2830
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:55,456
The cheese the biggest threat to democracy

2831
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,224
It's a bunch of

2832
02:25:56,480 --> 02:26:02,624
Take her out she's a globalist communist who is trying to come after your guns

2833
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,672
Globalists aren't necessarily

2834
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:05,952
Even

2835
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,232
Socialist

2836
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:09,024
Communist Folk

2837
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,304
You know what you

2838
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:14,144
Like

2839
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,168
I don't know

2840
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,192
Everything

2841
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:18,240
Everything about the modern-day

2842
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:20,288
Apathetic

2843
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,568
It's so pathetic

2844
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:24,896
It's not like I want him to advocate for people

2845
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:26,944
You should

2846
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,088
He should be up

2847
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:34,112
Calling for blood

2848
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:36,928
I agree and he's not because he knows

2849
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,464
That's not how I make money

2850
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,632
As we see all this in

2851
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,192
Michelle like

2852
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,472
Kim Jeong Hoon

2853
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,520
Making more nuclear tests

2854
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:53,568
Rodger stone that the walls are closing

2855
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:56,384
Things are happening at 8

2856
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,408
Information just

2857
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,200
Seeping out

2858
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,480
Pictures

2859
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:01,504
Becoming clear

2860
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,296
Unclear of what really happened

2861
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:05,088
Not just in between

2862
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:05,856
16 election

2863
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:07,136
But four years before that

2864
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:08,160
Yeah

2865
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,952
I was kind of nose and it

2866
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:20,448
This is a conversation that you don't want to have and you really don't want me to start

2867
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:23,264
Maybe so let's find out

2868
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:25,824
Yes

2869
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:27,872
Calling for blood

2870
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,432
What realistically

2871
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:32,736
Put it put it all together

2872
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:39,136
All right we have any free have an illegitimate government that was assisted by

2873
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:42,720
IV by a foreign power not least of which

2874
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:45,280
Was put in by a minoriti

2875
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:47,328
Of the country that was

2876
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:50,400
It legitimately stolen by how much

2877
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:53,216
F****** b******* out all of this

2878
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:59,616
Gerrymandering all of this should never have been there because

2879
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:04,992
It was a f****** destroyed

2880
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:09,600
Exactly

2881
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:13,952
It's important to remember that the American Revolution happened because people had

2882
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:15,488
To pay like $0.02 more

2883
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:16,512
Intex

2884
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:19,328
Like that

2885
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,144
No

2886
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:26,240
It's literally all the time

2887
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:30,336
Like I'd like legitimately protest

2888
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,664
F****** incredible

2889
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:35,712
Millions of people

2890
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:36,736
Walk

2891
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,552
Throughout this entire country

2892
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:40,576
Supporting

2893
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:41,600
Immigrants rights

2894
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,672
But we saw the same thing at the women's March

2895
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:49,024
We saw the same thing at however f****** many March we thought we saw

2896
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:51,840
Maybe world record

2897
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:59,264
Flash forward to the present we are most likely

2898
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,568
Supreme Court Justice

2899
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,616
Access to abortion

2900
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:14,112
Like in the computer American history from

2901
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:14,880
Perspective

2902
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,440
Cuz that's illegal

2903
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:21,024
That's technically True Blood

2904
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,584
I mean there is that

2905
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:30,496
But it's probably

2906
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,800
We're on the wrong side of the law

2907
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:34,080
If we advocate

2908
02:29:34,336 --> 02:29:34,848
Violence again

2909
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:41,248
Anybody before were already on the wrong side of the law just for

2910
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:42,016
News about Trump

2911
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:44,064
Probably

2912
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:46,112
Here's the only

2913
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:48,160
I know I'm a f****** middle guy

2914
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:49,696
The old

2915
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:55,840
When the guy to the left of you is saying

2916
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:57,120
Murder people

2917
02:29:57,632 --> 02:30:02,240
The middle

2918
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,264
I have this

2919
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,568
Hesitant about what you're saying is that

2920
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:08,384
Like I know that there's a lot of people who listen to

2921
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,408
To our show

2922
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:11,968
I don't think anyone would hurt anybody but

2923
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:14,272
I do want I worry

2924
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:15,040
About

2925
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:16,832
The rhetoric

2926
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:17,600
But you're

2927
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,648
Presenting

2928
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:21,184
Only because

2929
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:21,952
I don't

2930
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,232
Think that

2931
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:24,256
Target's would be

2932
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,072
That makes sense

2933
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:32,448
I don't think that innocent people should be hurt and that is what would end up happening

2934
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:35,264
If any organization not just

2935
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,032
Ralix

2936
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:41,920
If Alex did it end up in the situation where very innocent people

2937
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:45,248
Are collateral damage of some b******* which is

2938
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,528
Probably right

2939
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:51,136
For the situation that we have on our hands

2940
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:54,208
Now it's believes there should be Blood on the streets cuz the globalist

2941
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,488
719 13th

2942
02:30:59,072 --> 02:30:59,840
But jacket

2943
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:02,912
The wrong people get hurt in both

2944
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,192
Equation

2945
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:08,544
I don't like that that's why I'm in the middle in terms of this stuff

2946
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,824
In my defense

2947
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:13,408
I know I know I know

2948
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:16,480
We're both so polite at

2949
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,600
I have never

2950
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:24,416
Advocated for wholesale

2951
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,696
And in fact

2952
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:30,304
Consistently

2953
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,072
The difference

2954
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:33,376
Between a nation and a

2955
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,144
Government

2956
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:38,240
I don't believe so I don't think that

2957
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,520
I don't think

2958
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:41,824
That there should be blood in the streets

2959
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,360
In that f******

2960
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:49,760
Whatever because I'll be goddamn

2961
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:53,344
Scott Pruitt find a tall oak tree

2962
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,112
Yes

2963
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:56,416
The Koch brothers

2964
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:58,720
Should have their homes burn down

2965
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:06,400
They would not be allowed to go outside while at the same time their house would have burned down

2966
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:07,936
With them inside of it

2967
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:10,496
That is the reality of the situation

2968
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,800
And the fact that every day

2969
02:32:13,056 --> 02:32:16,896
We get f****** people murdering journalist

2970
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,992
Stinks

2971
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:23,040
Which is that one side has been

2972
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:25,600
Fighting a war against us

2973
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:26,368
For the past

2974
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:27,136
15

2975
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,160
20 of

2976
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,208
Whatever America

2977
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:31,488
All of America

2978
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:34,304
And we have never ever fought back

2979
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,840
Against the Real Enemy

2980
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:39,168
We're not in versus the Warriors

2981
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:40,448
Patrician the two sides

2982
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,032
And we can't play different games

2983
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,176
It's time for the long arm of the law

2984
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,200
But few of them down

2985
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:53,504
Cymbalta maker

2986
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:59,904
He'll settle down

2987
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:04,000
Not ever.

2988
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:08,096
Here's a general

2989
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:10,656
Genuinely what I would prefer to

2990
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:15,264
I would prefer an Alexandria ocasio-cortez

2991
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,056
Become an attorney general

2992
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:19,104
F****** New York State

2993
02:33:21,664 --> 02:33:24,736
Do you think that the Koch brothers haven't committed f****** crime

2994
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:26,784
In New York City

2995
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:29,088
How long did it take

2996
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,368
Don't

2997
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:31,648
Don't you dare do it

2998
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,184
I'm going to give you plus one

2999
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,464
And then I'm going to take it away

3000
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:35,488
But I didn't

3001
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,840
How long did it take you

3002
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,120
How long does it take us

3003
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:44,192
To find out that Alex was committing a

3004
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:48,032
Like a concrete crime it's probably likes

3005
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:50,080
It took some investigation

3006
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:57,504
Investigate

3007
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:00,576
Figure it out in the first month

3008
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:05,440
If you've been anointed I didn't I wasn't that wasn't what I was trying

3009
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:10,304
If you if you really I'm in I'm not going to lie

3010
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:16,704
If you really wanted to take Soros down f****** start investigating because if you're really

3011
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,752
Billionaire

3012
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:23,616
There's a crime

3013
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:25,152
East valinda satisfying

3014
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:27,456
All the crimes that

3015
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:31,552
Alex and his ilk commenters on our website about it

3016
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,112
Allege

3017
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:36,160
Are real

3018
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:38,208
Like I'm sure there are things that he's done

3019
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:42,304
He's accused

3020
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,120
I don't give a s***

3021
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:48,448
F****** p****

3022
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:50,240
I'm not I'm not here to defend him

3023
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,544
Exactly Hillary to

3024
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:58,944
If you find a Chrysler

3025
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:02,784
These people should be in jail

3026
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,832
This is a team effort

3027
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:06,368
By the rich

3028
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,904
Overall our thing

3029
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:11,232
This has gone way off the rail

3030
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:16,608
I think

3031
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:19,680
We should do

3032
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,960
However

3033
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:21,984
Chicken alfredo

3034
02:35:24,032 --> 02:35:25,056
Here's what we can't do ever

3035
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,360
Another song

3036
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,384
And that's what we need

3037
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:33,248
I'd like to bring up so long because I think he's the best ruler of all time

3038
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,784
I can't happen

3039
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,576
I know I know that it

3040
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,112
But

3041
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,392
It is the thing that we need

3042
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:41,952
Never

3043
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:42,720
Going to

3044
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:46,048
It's weird that the way that you present yourself

3045
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:47,072
Your hypothetical

3046
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:49,120
Very similar

3047
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:49,888
In the terms of

3048
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:53,472
He was like I'm going to make these rules and then I'm leaving

3049
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:59,872
I'm out so you have that paralleled at

3050
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:02,688
Another ask Azek

3051
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:03,456
Syria

3052
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,992
The shaking off of bird

3053
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:07,040
We need

3054
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:07,808
Forgiving of

3055
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:08,832
Dirty deck

3056
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:10,368
We needed that.

3057
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:13,952
That that sort of thing needs to happen because back in the days of ain't

3058
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:14,720
Engine grease it was

3059
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
People who sold them

3060
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:16,512
Resolves into slavery

3061
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,560
And now we have modern equivalent

3062
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,376
Absolutely modern Google

3063
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:22,912
Parking short-term

3064
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:24,704
Car loans

3065
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:30,080
Like what else is that underwater because of ground

3066
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:31,104
There's

3067
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:34,688
But the reason they have someone is because Trump

3068
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:35,712
Is

3069
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:42,368
He sold himself as so on exactly in the same way that we

3070
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,136
Can't be like

3071
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:49,536
They're coming for your guns and buy and all that should because the hard-right has taken that

3072
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,328
In the same way Trump

3073
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:54,912
Pretended to be that Solon he pretended to be that

3074
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:56,704
I am the guy who is going to

3075
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,472
Fix every

3076
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,496
Because that's

3077
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,520
Really what you want

3078
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:00,544
Because you know

3079
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:01,824
Ultimately

3080
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:06,176
No I was like I don't want to do this was selling himself

3081
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,712
Which is better at

3082
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:14,624
History WhatsApp have

3083
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,160
The Kraken

3084
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:19,488
In Iceland in Atherton

3085
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:20,256
Yep

3086
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:22,048
With Liam Neeson

3087
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:25,120
I don't know I don't know I don't know how to put a button on

3088
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,144
But

3089
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:26,912
I think

3090
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:31,776
Where we spawn off way too far was the idea that you want blood on the

3091
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:35,872
Don't want it's not

3092
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:41,248
Very least I'm going to go through it I feel like Pruitt should be murdered in front of everybody

3093
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,552
The most corrupt person I think

3094
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:45,344
Incredible

3095
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:52,000
Is really killing it on the guy I almost admire him movie come back to now

3096
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:53,792
We're talking about is

3097
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:56,096
Entire thing is

3098
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:00,960
2 years

3099
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:03,520
The normalization of corruption

3100
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:08,896
Status quo

3101
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:11,200
Yeah I think we'll get away with stuff

3102
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:15,296
Is more OK Google get away with Stephanie

3103
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:17,088
And it just keeps going

3104
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,392
Just keep going and that's what I think that's the

3105
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,416
We're going to

3106
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:21,952
No unfortunately

3107
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:24,000
This is the part that sucks

3108
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:24,768
Because

3109
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:27,584
If you had a situation where you had just a

3110
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,352
F******

3111
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:29,376
Business

3112
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:31,936
Like a trump who was just like

3113
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:32,704
I want to

3114
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:34,240
Corruptus f****** make

3115
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,800
Ton of money

3116
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,080
Kleptocracy where

3117
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:40,128
You have like a family businesses

3118
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:41,920
Expensive

3119
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:47,808
All of the contract making billions of dollars and sense

3120
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:48,832
To be in

3121
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:53,696
The problem is the merging of that with people like the Stephen Miller

3122
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,768
The world of that like

3123
02:38:58,304 --> 02:38:59,840
Corruption is cool

3124
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:00,864
Mentality

3125
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:01,888
With

3126
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:02,912
Overt

3127
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:05,984
White nationalism White

3128
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:07,264
Separatism

3129
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,032
Bright

3130
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:09,568
Voodoo sorcerer

3131
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:11,360
And you know what f*** I do

3132
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,128
Give a s***

3133
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,152
Let's just lay it

3134
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:18,016
Everyone was afraid of Barack Obama being a black

3135
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:21,344
Good evening

3136
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,368
They were right

3137
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,952
It wouldn't have mattered in the same way that it would matter

3138
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:27,232
The Trump is a white

3139
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:28,000
Agree

3140
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:29,024
Because

3141
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,072
Barack Obama even if

3142
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:32,096
President

3143
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:33,376
Tough row to hoe

3144
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:34,656
You know like huge

3145
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:36,704
A really hard time

3146
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,496
In terms of getting that blacks

3147
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:43,104
Supremacy up the hill

3148
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:47,968
Pushing a boulder up the hill and the reason that it's so scary

3149
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:48,736
To have whites

3150
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,272
Merged with

3151
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:51,296
Power is

3152
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,064
Because it's

3153
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:52,832
So

3154
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:53,600
Already

3155
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:56,160
Search already the State of Affairs

3156
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,952
Lakewood University

3157
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:00,000
White supremacy merge with

3158
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,304
You know what it is

3159
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:03,840
Everybody knows what it is

3160
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:06,912
And we just are afraid to say it because

3161
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:09,216
We feel like we

3162
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:10,496
All of us

3163
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:14,080
Not all of us I mean obviously there is there's you and me in the pot

3164
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:17,408
So many other brilliant people the people who

3165
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:20,480
Marching

3166
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:21,248
But

3167
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:24,320
The status quo is terrified

3168
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:25,856
Acknowledge

3169
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:27,904
Because if you acknowledge

3170
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:29,440
If your Nancy Pelosi

3171
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:31,488
And you go out and you say

3172
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:34,816
