10
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
What time what was it

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
I think it was Judo like my brother was he took Judo when we were much younger and I think I tried

12
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
Tried to get in on the act a little bit

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
It wasn't for you that you were at

Frowned upon not really allowed in the house o

22

Fast rule against martial arts movies

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Things that

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Was like something

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,856

00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
We could watch like Mystery Science Theater and stuff like that

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Stuff that was made fun of satellite of love

32
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384

41
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:53,824
Yeah I don't know it's not the martial arts

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,384
Discipline involved is very

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
You know high-level

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
But

45
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
My body does not like

46
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
You got to get hit

47
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
You got to be the one who gets thrown sometime in early on

48
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Falcor

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888

How to fall off at board

51
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,080
I don't know much about martial arts

52
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
You know how when you drink booze

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
You get hungover

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
You know how that's a thing that happens I take it Alex

55
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Israel hungover

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
No experience

57
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Describe is an Alex Jones hangover from that Rodger deposition

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
Just did the sweetest of

59
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
The Divine juice shore shore and then come back to Alex

60
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
God

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
What night having so much fun and now I'm miserable for the rest of the week

62
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Do you like

63
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Why can't it always be like

64
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
So it's it's

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Caliva it was a tough

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
Dial transition by deposition

67
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
Opposition if it were possible like you

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
If there were enough

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Source material of Infowars people being

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Deposed

71
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
Percent

72
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,055
Dating is like they're happy have to be there

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
Answer questions and that's a really interesting dynamic

74
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
But so what I thought we would do today is to go over

75
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
Actually intended to do a bunch of days

76
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,695
Stop possible for February 20th 2020

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
2020

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
And the reason the reason for that is that

79
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
That's the day that Rodger got sent

80
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
Seems like it would be good idea to see how Alex took the news

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
Score was going on on his show on that day

82
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
I should say that I also prepared

83
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Couch or Sundays

84
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
It show we're not going to go over there

85
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
It Bears mentioning something and that is that Max Keiser

86
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
The guy of Mexico

87
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
He was on

88
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
And

89
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Alex endorse

90
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Bitcoin

91
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
It's not

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
To be ecstatic

93
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
What's it like

94
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,607
I don't know if somebody is real secret like

95
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,495
Alex was having a conversation with him about it being bold 2.0 and

96
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
It was a much more Full Throttle.

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Ultimate venom

98
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,431
Ever heard him give he's always been very skeptical and suspicious and pick one

99
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
And I it was

100
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
In your hand

101
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
I wanted

102
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
To cover that are at least mention it because if

103
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
You'd see some signs in the future of things

104
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
Related to that it's good to know like oh Max Keiser was on the show now

105
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
We talked about

106
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839

Knowledge of this early cuz we're looking at it from

139
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
The future

140
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
So he knows that Rodger Stone has gotten 40

141
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383

142
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
Alex start the show off with a prediction

Not for nothing

153
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Alex is instinct

154
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Sparta macroscale or bad

155
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,151

Really bad

157
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Just about all of this stuff

158
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Something

159
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
Disease that is instinct

160
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Most of

161
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
The beginning of this year

162
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
I would say a large portion

163
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Owen Shroyer is there at the courthouse

164
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Waiting for the verdict

165
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
And

166
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,167
Alex and him they they try and do a little bit of an interview or Alex's

167
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Talking to Owen

168
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Looks like on the ground

169
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
But Owen starts getting heckled by people

170
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Completely deteriorate

171
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
It's one of the more surreal things

172
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
I've heard

173
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
Transparently publicity stunt Ethan

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
I've seen Alex do it in my time covering him

175
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
We have a little bit of a dissection here were there actually

176
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Having a conversation

177
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
And Owen is out of line

178
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
They are seeing a signal that she's about to come back from Recess

179
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,191
7 years

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,007
It sound like she's lenient and gracious

181
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
Seven years I'm predicting

182
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Owen Shroyer

183
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,503
Call Alex you know it's it's incredible to because this is an obvious mistrial

184
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Just based

185
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Technicalities

186
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
The jurors committed crimes

187
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Incel meaning

188
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
When they lied on the jury questionnaire

189
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
What is queso

190
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
He's talking about the jury forewoman Tomeka Hart has become a bit of a target for right-wing media and their desperate attempt

191
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
Rodger was found guilty and is going

192
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Well that's what

193
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Globalists

194
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Oh dammit

195
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
Recent episode we talked about how Mike cernovich was pushing this theory that she had not disclosed that you'd run for office as a

196
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Democrat during jury selection

197
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
But as far as I can tell this is not been proven in

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
And anyway

199
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,047
All the proof survey Choppers is the fact that she had run for office

200
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
And that one of the questions potential jurors are asked

201
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Is a favor ever run for office

202
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
This is not an indication that you lied response to the quest

203
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
There's no proof that answering yes would

204
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Disqualifying there's nothing here

205
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
All this amounts to is an argument the jurors are asked

206
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
She had run for office

207
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
She was on the jury

208
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Therefore she must have lied about running for office

209
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
The logic is full of holes

210
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
And without any proof this is just people talking

211
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,255
Miss Hart has been the target of such vitriol that a fellow journey and Seth cousins

212
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
Came out and spoke with USA Today about how shity

213
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
It's always

214
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
He said quote

215
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,471
The irony here is that Tomeka Hart was perhaps the strongest advocate in the room for a rigorous process

216
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
For the rights of the defendant

217
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
A making sure that we took it seriously and looked at

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Charge

219
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,407
Cousins went on to say quote without her in the room

220
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
We would have returned the same further

221
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
And without looking as deeply into the evidence

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
I'm firmly convinced of that

223
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,231
I went in the right-wing media theory that Miss heart lied when being questioned is based on nothing other than their supposition

224
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
You heard that being echoed by Norm pattis

225
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
When he was on Alex's show last week

226
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
He hadn't even read the

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
The transcripts but was saying if

228
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
She's not disclosed

229
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
It would be a cause for

230
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
She didn't lie about it

231
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
There's an article in the hill published on February 50

232
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Can you put includes this line

233
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Quote

234
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
The brief examination of the hearing

235
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Shows that heart dip is closer ties to

236
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
The Democratic Party

237
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Us

238
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Judge Amy Berman Jackson

239
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
Asking first political history would prevent her from being fair

240
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
And heart assured her it would

241
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,583
Most of the non head right-wing propaganda sources I can find a really

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Clear that Hearts background was brought up in her fart here

243
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
Potential bias was established by that history

244
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
And Rogers lawyers had every opportunity to

245
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
To question her

246
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
And to eliminate her from the jury

247
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
If they wanted to which they didn't do

248
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
This is just sad s***

249
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
These people are so desperate to defend Rodger that this is the level of Defense they can come up with

250
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
Speculating wildly in a response to question

251
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
It turns out she answered honest

252
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Also not for nothing

253
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
What Owen is doing is directly accused

254
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Heart of a crime

255
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
With no evidence

256
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
To support the app

257
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Accusations

258
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,423
This is dangerous territory for a guy work at a place that he's drowning

259
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
In definition plants

260
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
It's just another girl

261
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,639
You would have thought that his time working with Rodger on the War Room would have trained him to be a little slicker

262
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Nope

263
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Turns out

264
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Can't copy that

265
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Not the

266
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Such like

267
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
This is just like

268
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
The Baseline of any Democrat on any jury isn't

269
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
You're not allowed if you're a Democrat you're not allowed to judge

270
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Anyone ever because you're evil automatically

271
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,703
Functioning

272
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
It is not Trump lovers

273
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Can't judge Trump lover

274
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
There isn't there is a supposition of

275
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Inability to see

276
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Past

277
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Political belief or whatever

278
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
They are enabled

279
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Ucpath

280
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
That kind of situation

281
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
On Willow

282
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Oran

283
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Tell me what you're asking for is essentially

284
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
And ending up with like a split

285
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Judicial system

286
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
People with different political beliefs

287
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
We have now

288
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Well GIF images not be based on Ray

289
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
FB

290
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
That's fine

291
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
So Alex wants to defend Rodger and

292
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Like look at it stuff

293
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
It's just because

294
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
There's a lot of evidence that he did the things he's accused of

295
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
And some of those things are said to really

296
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
Threatening messages to Randy credico when pratico said that he wasn't going to plead the Fifth

297
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Alligators

298
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
As you know I hate when you make threats

299
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
Towards someone who's going to go testify

300
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
It kind of tends to

301
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,799
Lend the idea that you're trying to threaten them into not testifying

302
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,175
Oh that's just how he signs off on all his texts just like hey Mama it's great to talk to you

303
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Next time I see you I'm going to murder your dog

304
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
Anyway let's have a great time bring up the dog things because Alex he actually has an explanation

305
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Oh no

306
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,463
That we're not considering okay

307
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Forgiven Stone and that he didn't believe it

308
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Dog

309
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Stone the judge says

310
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,495
I'll take that dog away from you if you're not feeding it enough

311
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Attacking credico

312
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Alright Alex

313
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
The f*** out of here

314
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
Really surrounding contact with Rogers threat to take that dog away for you should not support Alex's claim

315
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
Did we set out of Rodger scooter parties concerned for the dog's diet

316
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,095
The text say You're a Rat you're a stool you back stab your friends

317
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,447
I'm so ready Let's Get It On

318
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Soccer

319
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,079
To give some context to the I'm going to take your dog away from you

320
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
Rat You're a Rat that's what you've been feeding your dog

321
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
YouTube

322
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,063
What is not feeding your dog correctly but stabbing your dog in the

323
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
They don't make Starburst

324
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
Respect Alex singaraja talks hipocratico but that it shouldn't matter it's just locker room talk

325
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Serbian attempt to spin this with

326
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
In the realm of reality

327
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
This week should man

328
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:10,239
Alex really expect people to believe that Rodger was concerned that Randy wasn't feeding his dog enough

329
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
It was going to take

330
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Take the dog for its own good

331
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Science

332
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
May be ashamed of himself try to pitch something like that

333
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Yeah

334
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Your dick yes

335
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Alex's talking about randy

336
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Credit Karma

337
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
And this situation

338
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
And he says a few things

339
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Define

340
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Circular Leon

341
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Settling

342

Credit Karma

343
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Why have you been talk

344
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Randy credico

345
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
Assume to interfere with another trial I don't know if it's certainly not appropriate

346
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
The idea that a

347
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,055
Witness in Rogers trial will be having back

348
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Channel communication

349
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm not actually sure that is happening

350
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
But if it is I just wanted

351
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Put this in the episode.

352
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Alex is claiming

353
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Illegal

354
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
It's now on the record Alex's that claimed that he's admitting contact

355
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
With a witness in stone trial

356
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Text Alex

357
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
Has been sending him dog food just have a higher-quality

358
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Is a great guy in this earth

359
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
So Alex says that he's been in contact with credit going to like that

360
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Stockbridge

361
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
He said something else

362
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
This cookie

363
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
This could get weird

364
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Back and forth

365
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
Got dog and I now just makes it terrible is happening

366
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Stone

00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
I shall look for him to be on the show

369
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Today what

370
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
The judge to throw

371
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
Rodger directly into jail today

372
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Another bad prediction

373
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
And

374
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
Randy credico Alex is going to be on the show today

375
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
We have a special guest coming up

376
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,799
He frequently while having Owen Shroyer co-hosting with him

377
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,479
He's making calls and like disappearing wow

378
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
I wonder I wonder if Randy credico is going to show up on this episode

379
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Paw Patrol

380
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
He also might just

381
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Actually not be talking to him but like talking to Rodger

382
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,167
Just friends or something because Tyler Nixon one of Roger's personal attorneys

383
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Is does show up

384
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
On this episode

385
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
Delilah's shed

386
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
You know

387
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
You get to

388
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Get this weirdness on Infowars

389
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Sometimes

390
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Sometimes you just hear things in your life

391
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Like when Shroyer

392
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
So Alex is talking about how

393
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Trump is going to Pardon Rodger that's grey

394
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Sure

395
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
In discussion of that

396
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
You talked about other pardon

397
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
You might be confused when you hear that

398
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
Get clemency

399
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,943
1 hour

400
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
Plane flying home to Chicago

401
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,855
The power of the executive of the people we elected the president

402
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Wheels RV

403
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Judges

404
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Anger the out-of-control systems

405
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:18,655
So you might think it's weird to hear Alex be pretty okay with Trump pardoning notoriously corrupt

406
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
Former governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich

407
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Danny is a political

408
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
You be right

409
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
To think that was weird

410
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
It is

411
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Very weird

412
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
On the surface it seems like

413
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Very opposed to

414
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Blotto was a democrat in the most

415
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
Roughly Democratic state in the country

416
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,111
Part of the same machine that he thinks brought Barack Obama into the world

417
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Like this is not somebody who our to be pulling for

418
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
Do you always have to remember that Infowars

419
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Is weird

420
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Sometimes they have position

421
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
You wouldn't expect

422
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
And that is the case with Rod Blagojevich

423
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,519
Would almost guarantee that if we went back to anytime we're Bogota vich was

424
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
Governor at some point Alex would have talked

425
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Endless amount

426
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Chat about how he should be in jail

427
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,711
Well possibly but not after he got arrested

428
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Cuz according to Infowars lure

429
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,391
Blagojevich wasn't arrested because he was trying to profit off the filling of Obama's former senate seat

430
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Flagrantly corrupt action

431
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,511
He was taken down because he dared stand up to the Bank of America

432
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Images of

433
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
Part of the Federal Reserve System

434
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
If you f*** with

435
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
You end up like blogo

436
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
This narrative is based on the fact that on December 8th 2008 if it's restricted government agencies from

437
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
With Bank of America

438
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Until they were stored credit

439
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
To The Republic windows and doors

440
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
A factory in Illinois

441
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Bankruptcy

442
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
Whose employees were staging a sit-in

443
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
The next day

444
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
On December 9th

445
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
Lokoya vich was arrested on his corruption

446
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
These things happen

447
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,023
Close to each other in time there for a causal relationship has been established

448
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,119
And therefore it was a good guy was just trying to fight the fat and got screwed

449
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,215
As always on Infowars correlation not only equals causation

450
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
It doesn't even matter anyway

451
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Is there going to say whatever

452
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,151
The Infowars narrative makes it sound like Blagojevich was trying to permanently sever relations

453
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,991
Between the state of Illinois and Bank of America which is absolutely not the case

454
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
An article on Infowars says that he made a quote

455
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,647
Declaration that Illinois would no longer deal with Bank of America

456
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
That's just silly

457
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
It was a negotiation tactic he was using

458
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
To try and save the factory employees

459
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Articles from the timer really clear about

460
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
Like this one from December 8th in The State Journal-Register

461
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Governor Rod Blagojevich has

462
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
Stop doing business with Bank of America to pressure the company

463
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Need to help workers

464
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,152
We're staging a sit-in at the shuttered Chicago plant

465
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Lokoya vich says Bank

466
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
Scott Bigelow money and should provide lines of credit to businesses

467
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
That needed so workers can keep working

468
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,952
The employees were staging a sit-in because they were informed they were going out of business with no notice

469
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
And they didn't receive pay or any

470
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Ultimately Bank of America announced the settlement on December 10th

471
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
Where they would create a fund of 1.75 million dollars

472
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
To take care of the workers who owed back pay severance

473
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Vacation time and whatnot

474
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
This achievement was possibly help by Boulevard

475
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Which is action but it was

476
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
In any way it was

477
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
It was not

478
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Affected at all

479
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
By his arrest

480
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
The real win was because the workers stood their ground

481
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
And because the

482
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
The sport of the union electrical radio and machine workers of America Union

483
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
Anyway Infowars is super anti

484
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
They don't tend to get into

485
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
The details of the action

486
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Will story

487
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
No they protect a preferred

488
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,192
Just pretended blogo Exile Bank of America from Illinois and then was arrested

489
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
The next day because he was a threat to the Federal Reserve

490
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
This is how children tell stories

491
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
And that's a level of s*** that we're dealing with but

492
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Explain why Alex

493
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
Really okay withdrawal partner

494
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,064
Seems like something that would not make sense

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
Involving Blagojevich in Bank of America

496
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,232
I didn't even realize that until I looked into it

497
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Why

498
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
I just don't understand

499
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
You don't understand

500
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,936
Although I think it would be very funny if we woke up cuz there's a Bank of America

501
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Beer Works

502
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
We literally just walk out everywhere walked down the street and it's shuttered with giant blogo

503
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,688
It's less about like kicking the Bank of America outage

504
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
It's more like

505
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Estate agent

506
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Can't do business

507
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
The trains would still be open

508
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
I like the

509
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
ATMs

510
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
But

511
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
It was all just

512
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Negotiation

513
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
To help workers that were hurt by the

514
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
The downturn in the economy

515
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
The bailouts

516
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Yeah I know

517
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Simplistic

518
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
Now they're not great

519
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
So

520
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Alex's school with block

521
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Shark

522
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
No reason Chicago.

523
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Will Owens out there

524
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Courthouse

525
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
Up to this point it's been going okay

526
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Alex and him have been talking

527
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
About how Rodger got screwed and chopped

528
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
The inevitable happens

529
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
And

530
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
Other people get involved

531
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
They're trying to harass me right now

532
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
Rodger that

533
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Posey was convicted

534
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
People for committing the crime

535
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
What

536
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
Assault

537
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
Then they said that he attacked them

538
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,784
They did Africa cuz the guy said the f word

539
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,184
F*** you there

540
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
Like I don't I don't know if the like Owen was pushing this guy for the cameraman possibly push this

541
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,424
This guy but the guy who says do no don't f****** push me

542
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
That's what he says

543
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
I don't know

544
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
The video doesn't show that you wasn't bush

545
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
Right I don't know what to make of this but it seems like

546
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:53,760
Hey you know maybe somebody bumped into somebody and everybody's getting mad at each other

547
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
In high because they put horses there and everybody is

548
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Urea

549
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,720
So we get to this turning into a publicity stunt

550
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,792
Out-and-out now and Alex's just telling going what

551
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
How to do he's like

552
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Either Puppet Master

553
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
You better get used to it

554
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
You don't on

555
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
You want to see a man go to jail

556
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
You celebrate like a Nazi

557
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
You come out here like a Nazi

558
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,736
I'm celebrating an innocent man going to jail

559
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
An innocent man ignore the rat people ignore the rat guy go back to the medium

560
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Don't stop

561
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Corrupt corporate media look at those

562
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
Do just waiting for their orders

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
I see there's a real fun I ready

564
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Keep going

565
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
There's a real delicious irony and Alex telling Owen to go yell at the media who are waiting on orders

566
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
When he's giving online orders

567
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
It on its face is a little World War

568
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
So this goes on quite a while

569
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,112
Shame on you tell him for me shame on you in SM

570
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,536
Clinton pedophile ring

571
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
The mainstream music

572
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
I'm out here standing for Crews

573
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Kombu

574
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,320
Alright Alex

575
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
It's like

576
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
You know when somebody's got the earpiece

577
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
Pizza and you clearly know that they're getting instructions and

578
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
You don't hear within the ear

579
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
You know this is

580
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
Both happening at the same time of your life

581
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
Is this a joke with a

582
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Funny right now

583
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,240
It's the sort of things that maybe we should do from a

584
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
Visitation aspect

585
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
Just go to the video of all

586
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
You know it seems like showing both parts

587
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Looks sad

588
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,576
Alex is like two overeager to be out there

589
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
Bummed out that oh it is it doing this

590
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Exactly right like you can hear be like

591
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Infowars.com live

592
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,816
Plug-In or whatever it is

593
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
F****** plug-in f****** obvious but that's what Alex is really trying to direct

594
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Going to do

595
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
You just keep going cuz you're on a bunch of strange right now out there

596
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
For 4 minutes 3 minutes will come back from break

597
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Platinum have that one

598
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:40,160
It's obvious when he's telling him like you got a bunch of cameras on you right now

599
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
Discovering you out there

600
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
Get Infowars name out there

601
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
We're going to go to commercial but you got to keep going

602
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,888
Getting the name out there

603
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Free Press

604
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Seriously

605
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
It does have a feel of like

606
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
The ugly

607
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,432
Dad being like okay you got a harness your anger though

608
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,576
I've been angry the whole time but you can't let it get ahold of you you got to make sure you're promoting while you're angry

609
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Get rid of the anger

610
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,720
It's fake we're not trying to be angry that isn't that is a slight piece of it

611
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Alex is trying to explain to Owen like look

612
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
People going to yell at you

613
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Ignore

614
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Don't worry

615
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Cameras

616
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Camera

617
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,776
So they go to break and they come back

618
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
Edit turns out that Owen

619
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896
He left that area and found another press gaggle

620
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
Owen Shroyer

621
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Another

622
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Figure out where to go here

623
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Cameras

624
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,328
The cameras are watching important

625
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
This is

626
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,192
God but doesn't have like a levers and pulleys

627
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
The arm go up and down

628
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
This is the way that monsters

629
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Respond to things like this like he doesn't give a

630
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
The f*** like I mean obvious

631
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Rodger Park

632
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
Situation

633
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
There's a lot of media on this

634
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Yeah this is a prime opportunity for Infowars

635
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
It feels like it's this was Rogers

636
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Funeral

637
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
He would be like

638
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,976
Oh no it's terrible Rodger

639
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
It is for you to scream Infowars

640
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
What he would really

641
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
She was a soldier

642
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,776
The first hour of the show verdict comes in and Alex ghost

643
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Directly to Fox news coverage

644
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Go ahead and actually cut to the

645
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,200
Fox News live feed

646
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,952
So what was the actual reaction when we found out it was three years and four

647
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,352
Not anywhere near the 79 years that originally have been Prosecutor's recommendation

648
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Defense team breathed a sigh of relief stone

649
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
What I'm reading here and it's also

650
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Usually

651
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Before the judge

652
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
For their sentence

653
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Given that Opera

654
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,296
Rodger stone is not someone that shies away from comments or the

655
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
As we know so

656
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Mitsubishi

657
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
He'll say something

658
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
We still be under that guy

659
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
Carson now given three plus years

660
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
So you have a situation where Alex

661
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,640
Started the show with his prediction is going to get 7 9 11 years and they're going to take him away in handcuffs

662
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
All of this has not come through you got

663
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
A little over 3 years

664
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,320
Probably not going to serve even if he doesn't get a part

665
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
You'll still only be in for like a year or whatever

666
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
So that

667
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
That fail

668
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
He's like

669
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
The globalist swamp wants to destroy this man that failed

670
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
You going to be taken away in handcuffs

671
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
No he wasn't

672
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
At home

673
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
Preparing to go to prison

674
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
As we speak

675
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
So that predict

676
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
You complain about

677
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
You are

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
There's always something

679
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
No matter what whatever prediction

680
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Fails to materialize

681
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
There will be some way you can take the narrative

682
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah that's all

683
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
I have a

684
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
Great I love questions

685
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Alex can't possibly think he's

686
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
He's innocent of the

687
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
The charges

688
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
So he has to think that

689
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
What what Rodger did

690
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Wasn't illegal or if

691
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Or if it was

692
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:40,032
I don't know I think I think at that point when you're asking that asking me to assume

693
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
I don't believe

694
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
That

695
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
He can think

696
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,968
That Rodger didn't do the things that have been demonstrated that

697
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Be possible

698
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Difficult

699
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Look for me even Rodger

700
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Tell him that he

701
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm trying to trying to assume like

702
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
Whether he thinks that like he did those things

703
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,120
They should be illegal they are illegal but it's cool cuz he did it for a good reason

704
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
Difficult to believe like

705
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
He didn't

706
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
Send those messages

707
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
He didn't lie to

708
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Investigators

709
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
And that's why all of the defenses end up being like well this juror lied

710
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Cave in prison

711
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,600
No one's disputing that he did this s***

712
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Rodger

713
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,768
So Alex has now been out there to galuppi's camp

714
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
And in that clip you heard

715
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Throwing it to Fox News and he brings up

716
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
Was just on

717
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
The Fox News Feed

718
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
So there is an

719
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Increased

720
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Traffic

721
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
To Alex's website

722
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
And of course just naturally as we've seen whenever these things happen that are

723
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
Relevant to Infowars world like Rodger being sent to prison

724
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
People TuneIn

725
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
He's a big spike in traffic

726
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Any babe

727
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
Likely like you expect

728
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Ladies and gentlemen

729
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
We have

730
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
Gargle Saturday

731
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
3.4 in 1 oz of that is going to be selling out

732
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Very very soon

733
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Viruses

734
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Well

735
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,664
I also fish oil has vitamin D3 in it we have one of the highest qualities in a burpees for the ultimate fish oil that's an Infowars store

736
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
It goes on he just has a really long

737
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
Because there's a really long plug for supper

738
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,464
I think it's in the middle of the hour to like I didn't seem like very much

739
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Okay we've got eyes

740
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
We got eyes on this get to get along plugin

741
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
So does that goes out to Bri

742
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
And when he comes back

743
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Back to yelling at Owen

744
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
About what

745
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
This is America

746
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:00,064
Which overdrive them of the Truth Exposed

747
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,672
You're doing a bad job

748
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
So much like

749
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,048
The next thing you're going to say is alright fine I will be there in an hour

750
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,192
I'm getting in the teleporters

751
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Bed bed real quick

752
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,616
He's really like self-promote while he's out there

753
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,712
Come out here for their consolation prize

754
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:34,368
Kangaroo trial that totally supposed to destroy themselves everyone knows they had America

755
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,792
Tell him that he's been gagged but you haven't taken still looking

756
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,608
You're taken to watch your show he used to be your co-host

757
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
If you want

758
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
You better continue watching The Warriors

759
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
It's just so

760
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
Walking clear that

761
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Is to get

762
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
Eyes on the Sun

763
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Product

764
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Promote

765
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
What it's like

766
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
I would have responded meditation

767
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,288
Weird old white people escaped from a mental institution

768
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
Kenosha

769
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,944
Clearly exhibiting Behavior

770
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Behavior

771
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,768
I said nothing

772
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Bass

773
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
This is real TV and radio

774
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
He wants to try to humanize them and talk to them they do

775
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Do you

776
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,664
You're in front of all the news cameras for Rodger he's been silent t-shirt

777
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
The people there

778
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
Ghost

779
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Find info on someone

780
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:13,952
I get out your child is using fentanyl take it away it's another bad and they don't hear me

781
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
Speak to the news cameras

782
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,448
So very weird things were your kid about

783
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
The primary issue

784
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Here is the like

785
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
The Infowars correspondence

786
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Who go out on the field as a brand

787
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,760
They have a specific thing that they're supposed to do

788
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
And Owen is working across purpose

789
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
He doesn't realize

790
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,672
Because I think he thinks that he's like a legitimate

791
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,744
Maybe he thinks he's good at what he does I don't know

792
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
For whatever reason he sees

793
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,632
Engaging with people who are telling him he's lying about stuff is good play

794
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
Yeah it's not

795
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,496
His brand is as like the guy

796
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,128
And yelled at Jerry Nadler and got taken out and they got hurt and he was going to be in prison forever

797
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Yelling at the impeachment stuff

798
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,248
That's his brand yep he's a strong young man

799
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
He is not

800
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,368
The person who maybe looks incapable of arguing with a crowd of people

801
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,256
That's weakness yeah that is not good for Owen Shroyer Owen Shroyer destroys

802
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
You can't do that in a live feed they need those videos to be produced where he does actually run into somebody that he just

803
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Troy's menu

804
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Can package that send it out great

805
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
Works with the branch

806
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Talk to random

807
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Strangers

808
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
In this case you just needed to be defiant

809
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
A voice yelling truth to the

810
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Cameras cameras

811
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Your brand is

812
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
The Defiance guy yelling at these cameras

813
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,464
You try and get out of your lane a little baby doesn't work for Brandon

814
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
Doesn't work for marketing

815
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Stator f****** Lane y'all at the cameras

816
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Alex

817
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,376
Keeps keeps getting distracted

818
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
By people who just like you suck

819
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Why is he

820
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
This is how it always works

821
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Never engaged

822
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Capers

823
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
No more coverage from Owen Shroyer

824
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
And then actually end of itself

825
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,696
You're doing a great job but

826
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Capers

827
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,656
You're in front of all the camera talk about Rodger colas

828
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
It's just so obvious man

829
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
When you

830
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
You have both sides of the Earp

831
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Pieces

832
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
Overtly

833
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
What you're trying to

834
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,944
To do this is a stunt this is publicity

835
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Stop engaging

836
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Do your job

837
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
I'm very sad

838
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
But

839
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Does manage to find Rogers

840
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Sporter in the crowd

841
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
Who's this fella right here with Rodger Stone

842
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,304
Enrique tarrio

843
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
What's up guys what's up Infowars we're here

844
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
It's not a random

845
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,728
Rodger supporter

846
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,800
That's Enrique tarrio is the chairman of the proud

847
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Oh that's not

848
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
Keeping score Oz accusing all the people there

849
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
My God where the people mad at Rodger

850
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,344
They're all AstroTurf and therefore has some nefarious unspecified purpose

851
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:27,744
I would manage to find one person there who supports Rodger and happens to be the leader of a street gang is associated with Rodger

852
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
Who happens to own the T-shirt shop

853
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,632
It's sold the Rodger Stone did nothing wrong sure sure

854
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Seems like there's a whole lot

855
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Conflict

856
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
Should be pointing out in relation to interviewing this person

857
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,616
Supposed to just presenting them as a random supporter Rogers from the heartland

858
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
He's a real

859
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Whatever

860
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Bulshit

861
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Decides

862
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
You found a guy who can talk

863
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,904
Go ahead interview that guy I'm going to take

864
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,464
Owen talks to Enrique for a little bit

865
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,000
Calvary is there

866
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,584
Cavalry

867
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Yes it's time for us to take calories

868
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
We needs it we need to get off the

869
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,640
Are you been on his show

870
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
Run for office I'm running in

871
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Jordan's 2017

872
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Take a break

873
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
So somehow the irony of this

874
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Entire interview is lost

875
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
On on

876
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
He's talking to the leader of a street gang is out there it needs

877
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
Get more active

878
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
Cavalry

879
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,288
It's legitimately not tie these dudes insist on pretending that they're in anyway Journal

880
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,360
Is operating as more or less like a

881
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
PR firm

882
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
Crypto monarchist

883
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
So he gets Oreo is running for a seat in the house

884
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,392
Has he mentioned in that clip there but there's literally no chance he's even going to make it through the primaries

885
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
However

886
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,048
He did answer survey questions about his candidacy for ballotpedia and I found some of it pretty Illuminator ride

887
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
41

888
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
You're the list of people that he admires and he looks up

889
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:14,496
So you got like Martin Luther King Jr Winston Churchill

890
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
But you know who else is on there

891
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Jack Pacific

892
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
I get hey maybe you like him

893
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
You did not admire him

894
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,136
Zero calculator Martin Luther King

895
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
I think we know which ones he actually cares

896
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:39,328
Martin Luther King Junior with the guys pretend Comet Ping Pong pizza with scary

897
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Exactly

898
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
So he was asked her what

899
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
Media someone might take him to understand his philosophy

900
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Antonio's answer was

901
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,663
Quote the death of the west by Pat Buchanan and Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand so he's fun

902
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Great that's a guy want to talk to you in a party and it's not good

903
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
So he was asked

904
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
What do you perceive to be the USA

905
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,695
His greatest challenges of the nation over the next decade

906
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,815
His answer was quote partisan Division and the introduction of socialist policies in our

907
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
As for the partisan division

908
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
The leader of a right-wing street gang

909
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
And he was physically present

910
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,263
Unite the right rally so he can straight up

911
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Himself on that count

912
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
That's when the Socialist policies being a problem in the future it makes me wonder if he's campaigning on getting Social Security

913
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,271
I wonder if that the Socialist policies thing is just

914
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,879
Talking point the fun word for him to safe

915
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,439
Successful and popular programs in this country's history

916
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
I'm guessing it's the talk

917
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
I'm going to go with that

918
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,839
I also have a strong suspicion that Enrique tarrio is running for office

919
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,887
Get back on Twitter and PayPal

920
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,239
For the house you can make an argument that has programs

921
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,799
Election meddling

922
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,151
Tommy Robinson in Sargon of akkad tried to make that argument when they ran with you Kip

923
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,455
And I believe Laura Loomer has made similar attempt

924
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Get back on social media

925
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
Whatever the motivation do this dude as

926
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
No chance

927
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,879
Even in the GOP Primary

928
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,279
So anyway I do this interview and Alex comes back

929
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Caesars

930
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,239
Jones has a message to you

931
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,359
Rodger stone is innocent and will be pardoned you are losers you have

932
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,223
We have a message from Alex Jones

933
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
It's a real show of faith in your employees when you don't

934
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Haven a bad one

935
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,535
Is a lack of a show of faith when you do micromanage

936
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,375
We have to guide all their decisions you save this for me

937
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
This means you don't get address

938
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
They're able to

939
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Do the job

940
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
And not just that but

941
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,079
God if you know you're going to get

942
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
It's so many more

943
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
Because of this.

944
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Then

945
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
As important as it is

946
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Is to try and sell their

947
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,063
The other big perhaps the biggest thing you should be doing

948
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Putting on a f******

949
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
The people are going to watch

950
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,255
Tomorrow right you know like put on is showing people that like oh s*** yeah

951
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
I want to continue watching

952
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,143
I think Alex kind of knows on some level that like he's going to get whatever

953
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,727
Maintenance or like a retainer

954
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,799
It's more important to do a smash-and-grab robbery is supposed to

955
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
Your confidence scam

956
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
People are going to see through it

957
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
It's just just take

958
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,967
Take the Money and Run

959
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,063
So he's done without actually like the

960
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
The show some headlines

961
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,183
Of course we're going to end up getting into the Coronavirus

962
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
But you have some other stuff.

963
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,839
Now the ATL says the Senator Ted Cruz

964
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
Judaism

965
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,263
That you're at your other a Nazi

966
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Really

967
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:05,151
Pretty amazing to see

968
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
Oh I see

969
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,463
Good stuff helping yourself at the end whatever

970
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
Alex is taking it real hard to Bloomberg

971
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,375
And it's really interesting because on the 16th be Sunday episode that I wasn't too

972
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
A lot of that was anti-bloomberg stuff

973
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:33,823
And I think Alex is maybe getting into the possibility the Bloomberg is going to be the candidate

974
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,639
Really going hard at him

975
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,711
But what I find super fascinating is like the critique

976
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Could I see from the last

977
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Real

978
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
Turn Alex's

979
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
But Alex can't make those

980
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,671
Critiques of stop-and-frisk

981
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
It's all he could do is be like

982
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
Hi what's the run your life

983
00:45:54,047 --> 00:46:00,191
Soda taxes

984
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:04,799
That's all good well I think the actual criticisms or surrounding is

985
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,871
History of racist

986
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:13,247
Personal racism transphobia homophobia at these things are far more

987
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Salient

988
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
To see him attacking

989
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
Far more impotent in it then

990
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
The people who he

991
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
Globalist

992
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Yeah it is

993
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,119
It must be a struggle because when you're looking at Bloomberg next

994
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
To Trump your ear

995
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
Like his real decision is just like

996
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,239
A bigger a******* in each louder

997
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
The Arts

998
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
Stop. That's the other thing too

999
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
You can't make too many

1000
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
Complaints about Bloomberg

1001
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
Text because you support some outfit is that

1002
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:56,767
Sexual harassment complaint

1003
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
Bring up points about

1004
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
You don't want to discuss

1005
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,911
So it's weird.

1006
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
They're about

1007
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Attacking Bloomberg play

1008
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
Whatever

1009
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,871
Anyway ddl critique Ted Cruz for tweeting out a suggestion that Mike Bloomberg quote owns the media

1010
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Which of course is

1011
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
The classical elements of a Semitic rhetoric

1012
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Conspiracy theory

1013
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
In this case it's kind of a tightrope

1014
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
Needs to be walked if you don't want to

1015
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Mike Bloomberg

1016
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,951
AutoZone some media Outlets

1017
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,791
AutoZone

1018
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:36,191
Yeah yeah I don't think anyone get too upset if you want to discuss how the fact that he does personally own actual Outlets

1019
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Mike Bloomberg

1020
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
How that could happen

1021
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,775
Actual effect on the cover coming out of it

1022
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
It's really hard thing for me to believe the people who work at Bloomberg feel completely free to cover Mike Bloomberg from an unbiased

1023
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
That's an

1024
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
Acceptable things

1025
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
The Voice concerns about

1026
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,367
Ted Cruz was doing was suggesting the Bloomberg owns the media not

1027
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Specific Outlet

1028
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
This plays into the narratives that have deeply anti-Semitic

1029
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
An organization like ATL exist in park

1030
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,815
The point these things out

1031
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,119
Not call Ted Cruz an anti-semite

1032
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
How to take advantage of a teachable moment

1033
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
People could learn today

1034
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
Express things better

1035
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Unto these traps

1036
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
That have been used to store clay for nefarious

1037
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Absolutely

1038
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,663
I think that you know you just see backlash about it

1039
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Alex

1040
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
Wonder why

1041
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Is Ted Cruz

1042
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,367
Bloomberg on their media outlet that is a

1043
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Damning and diaper

1044
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:32,511
Like you should not also own an own anything if you're going to be a present

1045
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
I don't know I don't know I don't know if he had comments then just the tweet

1046
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
About it

1047
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
I think that the two

1048
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Ted Cruz made

1049
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Closer

1050
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
2 pointing out the

1051
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
Ownership of Bloomberg that it was

1052
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
To say he owned the entire bag

1053
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
The phrasing of it and the way it was

1054
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Expressed

1055
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Was

1056
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
Not great

1057
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
Certipay

1058
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,695
No I'm saying you hate Jews

1059
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,767
Anyway now we get to some coronavirus stop

1060
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
This is dumb

1061
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
Scott it's gotten to the point where I wish they would solve

1062
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
The coronavirus issued just for me

1063
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
No I don't have to figure out

1064
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:20,639
Speaker audio there's a cruise ship whereabouts people have been quarantined

1065
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Diamond

1066
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Princess

1067
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,991
And excessive

1068
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
States

1069
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:31,391
I'm going to shift gears when you come back into the huge coronavirus development it's killing people on the cruise ships now

1070
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Multiple crochet

1071
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
People are dying that means it isn't High

1072
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
So here's some information that I absolutely never tell his audience about the two people who died on the Diamond Princess cruise ship

1073
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Japan

1074
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,823
What was 87 year old man with a history of bronchial asthma

1075
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,663
The other was an 84 year old woman who also had an unspecified preexisting

1076
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
These deaths are very sad and I don't mean to minimize them but demographically they are the sort of people you would expect to see dying from a virus like

1077
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,695
People in this cohort of the sort of people you expect to see dying of normal flu

1078
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Every year

1079
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,839
There's just no way around it people over the age of 80 with underlying medical conditions are too much greater risks

1080
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,399
Something like this then I healthy

1081
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
30 or 40 year old person is

1082
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:22,591
Unfortunately the cruise ship evokes all sorts of mental images that Alex can use to sell more fear about the virus

1083
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,151
People trapped on that boat they're running out of food

1084
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Getting laid off

1085
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:31,039
In reality they're about 620 people who tested positive on that boat recording

1086
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,111
Out of the original 3700 who were on the

1087
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
Cruise

1088
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,231
For the 14 days they needed to be for examination

1089
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Anime release

1090
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Sent on their way

1091
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
It's not an ideal situation are probably sucks to be quarantine

1092
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
Resume a luxury cruise boat is not the worst place ever

1093
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,823
To be stopped yeah I mean it's a lot better than the plague ships

1094
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
To use the pool

1095
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,063
I wondered about that when I wonder if it's bad taste for me to wonder about it

1096
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
I definitely would be the shrimp

1097
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,695
That's just that's just a problem

1098
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,535
So we got a situation now where at

1099
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
Alex Rambles about that event

1100
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
He's just a foolish

1101
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
But

1102
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
He comes back from break

1103
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
To the song

1104
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,751
Breaking the law breaking the law

1105
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Breaking the law

1106
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
I don't know what he's talkin to

1107
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,991
It's a little bit longer but it's one of his where he turns the song into part of the

1108
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:37,087
Like pieces of this he tries to time it for the choruses and stuff

1109
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
Professional

1110
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
Rambling

1111
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Skills Rock

1112
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,463
This is convoluted

1113
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
If you can make sense of this I would appreciate it cuz I

1114
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:51,423
In 1984 to 1770

1115
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,823
You're listening to The Alex Jones Show

1116
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:17,023
So I might as well

1117
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
Civilization

1118
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
Chivalry

1119
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
Hard mean things I didn't lie I didn't cheat I didn't steal that

1120
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
Came out of long bloody decade sometimes

1121
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,375
Millions dad and I promise never to do it again

1122
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:06,175
Darkseid

1123
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:12,575
Live live as free men and women and not live under

1124
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
Conquest

1125
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:20,511
Iron City the Destroyers Elisabeth Barnes ladle

1126
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,911
Turn loose the great spirit of human

1127
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,775
Freedom by passing limited laws

1128
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,431
The family and the individual and those that love God

1129
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,831
Continue to break the law God's ball common sense

1130
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
Natural law everything they do is about saying men or women and women or man and

1131
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
There is no right or wrong

1132
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:04,031
Breaking the law breaking the law

1133
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:10,431
Alright

1134
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,951
Tyler Nixon

1135
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Lawyer

1136
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,303
You can't talk about

1137
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,911
Metro Zoo

1138
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,007
Butera Dixon likely do

1139
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,663
I don't really know exactly what he was getting a

1140
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
But I think he felt it

1141
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
Yeah I know how he got the spirit

1142
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
I guess

1143
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
Chivalry like holding doors for ladies you talk about it like in the nights by the way like

1144
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,719
Right but I think

1145
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
I think we're jumping on

1146
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
Which side is breaking the law

1147
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,191
Very very liberally

1148
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Tyrants

1149
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
Are defeated by people

1150
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
Who break the law because the tyrants in

1151
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
Institute

1152
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,943
Right but then we have to make

1153
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Limited laws

1154
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,015
To rain in the tire

1155
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,575
Which those laws are not weak

1156
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
Strength

1157
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
But the Tyrant thinks the laws are weakness their front brakes

1158
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
Laws therefore I must break law

1159
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,791
Who's the one who's good at break

1160
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
Technologic jumped out

1161
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,631
I really don't know I think he lost the thread

1162
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Maybe the beginning I would say at the beginning

1163
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
I would say the moment he started

1164
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,311
Screaming breaking the law he was like I am loving this car is Lovett

1165
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,943
Got to try and work it in there and then he's like wait no I'm my guy is now the one making the laws

1166
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,783
I'm not positive I'm not positive that this requires

1167
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
A ton of analysis

1168
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
Outside of just like

1169
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
I think

1170
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,439
This is something I like to bring to the people

1171
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Because

1172
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,279
You know lately there have been more of these like

1173
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,607
Full songs

1174
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:09,215
These sort of lectures over really feel passionately

1175
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
It's kind of nice.

1176
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,847
Symbolize a little bit

1177
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
You talked to Tyler Nixon and like I said I don't really care

1178
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:24,319
I'm it's not in my interest at all to listen to Rogers friend be like Rodger got screwed

1179
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,695
You like that immediately after playing Breaking the Law Electric

1180
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,535
Who's here to talk about Rodger

1181
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
Bridget

1182
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,423
So are you get done talking to Tyler Nixon it's not very long

1183
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,215
Alex finds himself a to pick

1184
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
Visitors news

1185
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
About to Coronavirus

1186
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
He's got cover

1187
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
It's so big

1188
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
It's such big news

1189
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
I'm tired of this

1190
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
Something horrible

1191
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,391
Covering something this

1192
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,975
Covering something this serious

1193
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
Just mixed in with everything else were covering

1194
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Doesn't feel right

1195
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
The viruses I look at the scientific papers

1196
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
And I just

1197
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Breakfast

1198
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
Are you done

1199
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
We decided to show you

1200
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
Before I came on air

1201
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,047
Double-checking

1202
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,167
Double Dragon potion

1203
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,079
The military when it's got to go to your door

1204
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
Tell your son

1205
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
It's got

1206
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
This is not an enjoyable job

1207
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
But

1208
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,143
I don't blame Trump he doesn't know who he's hiring or what he's doing

1209
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,543
NY discover all this then I want to research every point

1210
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,103
Exactly right

1211
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:31,551
That must be so easy to do whatever you want

1212
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,463
Virologist that experts and then and then I'm correct calling a virologist

1213
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
Alex

1214
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Where is here

1215
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
It is absolutely

1216
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
You're sold out

1217
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Can I spend an hour

1218
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Morning lieutenant

1219
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
Again

1220
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,527
Call John what shows you've seen with experts in the night

1221
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
The Shadow

1222
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Don't feel confident

1223
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
Talking about this

1224
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Because I might make a mistake

1225
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,791
This is weird and it goes on forever

1226
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
And

1227
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,423
Is a story that he's trying to get to

1228
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,727
Just blurt it out

1229
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,055
It's it's all in service of what the end

1230
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,615
And we all know what that end goal is

1231
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
I just a mom

1232
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Homeland Security

1233
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,759
Show the Chinese virus

1234
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:39,135
5 years ago about it the scientist

1235
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,951
The biggest Publications out there

1236
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Then I read that

1237
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,047
I found all the papers

1238
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
And I'm just like

1239
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
I'm not a violent person

1240
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,967
Coming on Erin just talking about this is not a normal response

1241
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,551
Father-in-law

1242
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Things are so horrible

1243
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
That you just can't make it one more footnote

1244
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
So bad

1245
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
That I

1246
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Really muster my

1247
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
Will

1248
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,839
And really do some planning on how I talk about this

1249
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
You always

1250
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
I just can't

1251
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Is that what

1252
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:29,055
Doing all that research yesterday

1253
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Really

1254
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
Why the hell is our government doing this

1255
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,711
Trump didn't do this then

1256
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,063
But the guy he's got running NIH was involved into the time

1257
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,279
They are attacking

1258
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
If I don't tell people

1259
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,983
That folks doing that are violent towards everybody

1260
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
Running around with suicide vest

1261
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
False flag

1262
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:10,015
According to you yeah they didn't

1263
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
Become something

1264
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,159
The president

1265
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Really

1266
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,583
Under the US government did this

1267
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Restaurant

1268
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
How did they know they had this and out of there

1269
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,311
There's some big stuff going on here and so that's why I'm

1270
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,407
Shaken I just

1271
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,711
It's so big I don't want to go off half

1272
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,783
Cuz I'm indecisive person

1273
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Wheels turning

1274
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,023
Figure out exactly what I can do

1275
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
Damn you

1276
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:01,471
I asked you Jordan who if not everyone

1277
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Coronavirus news

1278
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,799
Google does the lead into a plea for money

1279
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
If I'm being honest

1280
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,103
I think it always snows

1281
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,407
The products he has to sell the relay to the outbreak

1282
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Kind of sold out

1283
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,783
He's made a bunch of money off this financial

1284
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
To cover the virus news

1285
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
For my help fear standpoint

1286
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Does coverage in the future

1287
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
Probably going to lean

1288
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
More towards the political intrigue

1289
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
As we see kind of Happening Here

1290
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
This article that you stalked

1291
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
About

1292
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
The scientist

1293
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,911
Are the Daleks reference in the clip has nothing to do with Obama selling a virus

1294
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
The Chinese government

1295
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:37,311
It's about a guy named Ralph baric who's an infectious disease researcher UNC Chapel Hill

1296
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,615
Chimeric Coronavirus

1297
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,919
It kicked off a debate

1298
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,223
About how

1299
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Involved

1300
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
It's a debate goes on within the scientific

1301
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
Community

1302
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:52,415
Right rice fairy article says that the US government halted all Financial

1303
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,975
Funding from the federal level for research like

1304
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,535
What's known as quote gain-of-function studies

1305
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,095
As it relates to influenza stars in Mercy

1306
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,679
But simply to adding a funk the funk

1307
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
Open of a pathogen

1308
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Giving it an added function

1309
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
In order to better understand

1310
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
It's a Direction with the world

1311
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
That's host

1312
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:14,431
It's long been a hotly debated question if he sorts of studies or ethical given the potential downside

1313
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,967
You have our

1314
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Practically in calco

1315
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
What I want to do

1316
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
Guys

1317
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Hear me out give me some money for

1318
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
I want to

1319
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
Make sure that smallpox

1320
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
Is 100%

1321
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
Fatal in order to study

1322
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
How fatal it would be

1323
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,911
If we release it into the greater population I don't think this is a bad idea

1324
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,031
Give me one batteries that's a farcical take on what these studies are but

1325
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
It's

1326
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Add something

1327
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,431
To this genetic level in order

1328
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
Testing

1329
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
In 2015 the scientist publish an article about this

1330
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,879
This guy at unc-chapel Hill function study on a Coronavirus

1331
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,207
But it's definitely not the same virus it's currently breaking out

1332
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
From China

1333
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,839
This article is not a study doesn't fall the study conducted by route

1334
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
There's no chance

1335
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,959
Even if it has nothing to do with the current situation

1336
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,383
Legitimately seems like it's out is only primary source on this and nothing in there says or even implies that Obama or

1337
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Homeland Security saw the virus

1338
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
China

1339
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
In fact

1340
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,271
Explicitly says that no federal funding went to that study

1341
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:27,135
Nor any like it released the two years prior so bomb had even less to do with this

1342
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
Alex has had his phone with a public health

1343
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:33,791
Panic sales drive but his heart isn't in it anymore

1344
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,863
The natural choices to make it a political thriller but I

1345
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,423
Also realize they can't pull that off of that total

1346
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Sing

1347
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,519
Complicit with releasing a bio-weapon on innocent civilians

1348
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
Kind of in a tough spot

1349
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Yeah that leads him to just like

1350
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,919
Cover this on a surface level with a

1351
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,807
Can't cover this I'm going to go off half-cocked

1352
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,111
Buy Homeland Security under

1353
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Obama

1354
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,719
The scientist lab Maine Coronavirus

1355
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,023
The creation of

1356
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
Disgusting

1357
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,703
Can you read the article exactly

1358
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Oh really

1359
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
Blame you

1360
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
And I got all the papers

1361
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
This clip came at the end of like 10 additional minutes of Alex being real insecure about every can't cover the virus news

1362
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
Any proximately half an hour of his show he dedicated to talk about how we can't talk about the virus news for mistake

1363
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,535
He could have easily covered whatever story he thinks is the big scoop

1364
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
This is performance

1365
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
Now it's is playing the role of the student forgot to do there

1366
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
F****** homework

1367
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,959
It really shows and I click we just heard

1368
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,239
There's absolutely no depth

1369
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
They're at all

1370
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,103
It's grasping at straws trying to make this somehow sound research

1371
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,407
The headline about the lab-made virus causing

1372
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
Debate is not about Obama or the Department of Homeland Security big no virus

1373
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
In the scientific

1374
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,135
Community he's completely misrepresenting that source

1375
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,207
Instant of Alex not knowing what he's talking about number one

1376
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,839
Alex says that if you read the article it's just the same exact coronavirus that popped up in December in China

1377
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
This is not true

1378
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
He's making that up

1379
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,447
Instance of Alex not knowing what he's talking about number two

1380
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:22,591
Alex tries to save this virus from the 2015 article is the same one that the Gates Foundation has a patent

1381
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
Before it wasn't

1382
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,407
Gates Foundation

1383
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,735
Institute and it wasn't bad. Coronavirus

1384
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,807
It wasn't identical the virus mentioned in the article in visayan

1385
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,903
Instances of Alex not knowing what he's talking about numbers 34 in

1386
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Pet clippers less

1387
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Some 30 seconds long

1388
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,535
Idea what he's talking about

1389
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
5 *

1390
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:47,423
Bizuayehu does 30 minutes on his show but he can't cover the news because he knows the shitz weak

1391
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,775
But you can make nothing look like something with the a

1392
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Looks like this

1393
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,615
The article in the scientist is a complete zero and terms Valley

1394
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
What is narrative

1395
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Sweetly at

1396
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,711
Bucked up about it on air

1397
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
Like you can't do his job because the news is so big

1398
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,111
That passion will sell the week sure to his audience that even trying to engage

1399
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
With what's in the article or the study

1400
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,255
I'm not trying to sit here and pretend that Alex has some guy like he's a conniving genius

1401
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,303
But he does things for a reason

1402
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:19,935
He absolutely wouldn't have a job his audience stop for a second to ask themselves why he's doing the things he

1403
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:23,263
He's doing every now and again

1404
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,359
Trying to gild the lily

1405
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
I hate being

1406
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Split so much

1407
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,967
Especially when it comes to this cuz it's like

1408
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
We do the show

1409
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
I see you

1410
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,159
Hours upon hours upon hours of research

1411
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
And it sounds like the way you

1412
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,999
I don't do any research

1413
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
That sounds far more similar to the way out

1414
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,911
Right now doesn't that make sense there then you're sometimes wrong and I can plan out generally

1415
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,287
I'm even the stuff that I can do is imperfect

1416
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:01,151
Baked like I'm I'm wrong every now and again we certainly try our best to

1417
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
Cop to that

1418
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Attending situations

1419
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,759
Particularly surrounding like

1420
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:11,903
Fine points of the law and science

1421
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,463
Inability on my sleeve like those are not subject

1422
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
But I'm well equipped

1423
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,583
Read stuff over and get a good so

1424
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
Sense of it sometime

1425
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,167
Like today I can't actually consulted a specialist

1426
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
To get

1427
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
We're going to end up discussing

1428
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
But

1429
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
It's important

1430
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Like

1431
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
The recognize that like yes

1432
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,431
The way Alex speaks about these things

1433
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,247
Is indicative of someone who doesn't know what he's talk

1434
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,063
And all you need to do is

1435
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:45,439
Listen to someone who knows what they're talking about and that's not necessarily me all the time

1436
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
The difference

1437
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
What's between

1438
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
Let's say an expert

1439
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:53,375
And an Infowars expert

1440
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
Big Apple

1441
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,959
It reminds me of the way that he's doing

1442
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,543
As to whether he's selling the stuff reminds me so much of like

1443
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,639
I was I remember working with one of those Road hack

1444
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
Headliners

1445
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
At

1446
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Club in Aurora

1447
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
And I

1448
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
I could not understand

1449
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
Why this

1450
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Chilling

1451
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Because he was

1452
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
Garbage

1453
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,439
And then after one of the shows

1454
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
He came up to me

1455
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
You know what your problem is

1456
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
You're not

1457
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,559
Selling your joke

1458
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
Man you got a really

1459
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
Selves

1460
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
Even if they're weak

1461
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
If you sell the jokes right

1462
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
You can get a lot out of it

1463
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
90%

1464
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,567
Facade

1465
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:38,687
Since maybe and sometimes not even that

1466
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,223
Stop

1467
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Fool's Gold

1468
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,319
Yeah do you want a life being a shity headliners

1469
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,439
Edsel yolks

1470
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,511
So Alex has decided that the u.s. older virus

1471
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,607
China

1472
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,495
He doesn't know and that's why you need to fund Infowars Court enough to figure this out

1473
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
I guess

1474
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
It's so stupid

1475
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Is this offensively stoop

1476
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:12,479
Why would the US Shale this to the icons and then five years later it's released

1477
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
This is big is what I'm saying

1478
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't know exactly what's going on but man

1479
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,935
My brain is like a computer

1480
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
It hasn't popped out

1481
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:38,591
Add my gut my spirit my brain never wrong always

1482
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Bielicki

1483
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Pictures

1484
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Is it bad

1485
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
How is it

1486
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Soccer

1487
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Is just

1488
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
To set the stage

1489
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
For taking over Taiwan

1490
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
I don't know anyway

1491
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
What

1492
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Your hand is up

1493
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
To set the stage for taking

1494
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,751
For China taking Taiwan or United

1495
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
States

1496
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
Chinatown

1497
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:13,663
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm getting bogged down in the wrong because everything is very convoluted

1498
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:18,015
Some of it might become a little clearer as we go along with some of it absolutely want

1499
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
Some of it is dress

1500
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Nonsense

1501
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Breaking the law

1502
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:26,207
We we learn something here while Alex has been pushing this narrative that the

1503
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,023
Canadian lab the one in Winnipeg is the source

1504
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,375
Stop cuz there was those two Chinese

1505
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Expelled from the lab

1506
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
Turns out

1507
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,519
That might not be true

1508
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,567
New age of the new millennium

1509
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:52,575
This is something that's going to kill you and your family and make you have a heart attack and make your lungs bleed out

1510
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
And it.

1511
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Ugly socks

1512
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
That's why meta

1513
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Physically you all are concerned

1514
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,023
Because we know all this distance

1515
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
And it was produced in the United States

1516
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Disinformation

1517
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Chart

1518
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,567
Did the damn thing in plain sight

1519
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,895
Oh s*** turns out the can of stuff with misinformation

1520
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:22,271
That's wild because I have a ton of coverage about how the virus was stolen from that lab in Winnipeg on Alex's show from Alex

1521
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,831
I just trusted experts like the health Ranger Mike Adams

1522
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
That can't possibly be the case

1523
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:31,487
God is never wrong is Right 99% of the time so there's no way you would spell ridiculous

1524
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:35,327
About time on the show trying to spread conspiracy theories about that lab in the past

1525
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:40,447
Oh no it's misinformation and disinformation Dan that means that it was

1526
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,495
Targeted and it was on purpose

1527
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
So it's not his fault that he got it wrong

1528
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,247
But his gut was telling him not to go with it but he went ahead with it anyways because

1529
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Belpres

1530
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,855
I'm passed out like you got tricked by that

1531
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Contrite

1532
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,999
It's not like you saying I shouldn't February 16th Hoosier

1533
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,023
Just last Sunday

1534
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Let's listen to a little bit of that

1535
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,679
Everything Mike said

1536
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,215
2 freeway

1537
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
Like what

1538
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,335
Number for Humanity Lone Survivor

1539
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:24,735
Alright fine only as an excuse to keep these

1540
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
Apocalypse

1541
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Predict

1542
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
So here we have on Thursday

1543
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,695
We have Alex saying that the Canada stuff is just misinformation

1544
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,487
But on Sunday

1545
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Here is what he was

1546
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
I agree with you

1547
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,351
What has changed in the last week

1548
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
I believe this was also deliberate release

1549
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,191
So that's interesting

1550
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
It's under for Humanity

1551
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
Introduce

1552
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,079
Asian twerking

1553
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
Virology lab in Wuhan

1554
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,975
The guy who ran that Canada lab being killed he was killed

1555
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Is that

1556
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,607
So this is conspiracy theory about that Canadian lab where the two Chinese people were taken out of the lab back

1557
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
July

1558
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,703
That was Doctor cool and her husband at kidding

1559
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Chang

1560
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:22,847
Now if you come to the present-day CTV News reported back on February 4th that a man named Frank

1561
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:27,199
Plumber National microbiology lab which is the lab in Winnipeg

1562
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,735
I passed away at the age of 60

1563
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
B7

1564
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
This is a very sad story

1565
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,599
Did you actually read articles about his passing it.

1566
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
Look like this was a murder or even suspicious

1567
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,183
Switch Alex's definitely trying to

1568
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Imply

1569
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
CTV News

1570
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,655
In December and December plumber share details of his personal battle with alcohol use disorder after undergoing

1571
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,959
Experimental brain treatment to treat

1572
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:54,847
He told CTV News how using alcohol to relax after work progressed to a habit that saw him drinking up

1573
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,639
220 oz of whiskey a night

1574
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,223
Leading to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease diagnosis

1575
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
In 2012

1576
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
The stress of responding

1577
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Pandemics

1578
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,647
Unable to stop himself from returning to alcohol after

1579
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
A24

1580
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,183
Team Liberty

1581
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:15,839
Ended up getting that experimental procedure done B was a it what it is it implanted electrodes

1582
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
His brain

1583
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,399
It turns out that that did have some

1584
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
Positive effect on his desire to drink

1585
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
That's Ed

1586
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:26,591
He clearly did it was a kind of Drinker who have done serious damage to his body by that point

1587
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,615
What's good

1588
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,455
You can stop drinking but you'd already had cirrhosis and liver transplant and kept

1589
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
Very very sad

1590
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,623
It's true the plumber was the head of the same lab that these two Chinese scientist from

1591
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
The plumber couldn't

1592
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,231
Anything to do with that situation since he left his position in 2014

1593
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Citing personal reasons

1594
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
Most likely the severe alcoholism

1595
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,607
This is sloppy s*** on Alex

1596
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
Deep disrespect

1597
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
The doctor plumbers Bass

1598
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,495
Everything I can tell you is a fantastic researcher who struggled with

1599
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
I'm heavy demon

1600
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
Only to get his life back on

1601
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
Contract which is in

1602
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Aspirational

1603
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,615
And also tragic

1604
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,175
Conspiracies don't care about people

1605
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
People are things

1606
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,039
Mere props to be used to make narrative sound more convincing to the audio

1607
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,599
Who are also people who don't matter to the conspiracy

1608
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
The people listening

1609
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
D2r just props

1610
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
To spread the narrative

1611
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
This is all very disgusting

1612
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
And it's

1613
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,559
Call Alex's talked about like all these

1614
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Dehumanizing aspects

1615
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,375
Global Life

1616
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,191
Take a second to think about him

1617
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
Treating this doctor's death is

1618
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
A mere prop to be thrown out

1619
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
To support

1620
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:33,407
The Narrative that the virus was stolen from this lab and in Winnipeg

1621
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,223
She's now seeing this misinformation of me or couple days later

1622
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
This is what it takes

1623
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
To be an Infowars believer

1624
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,391
To take a shower of seriously you have to believe that a guy who tries to use a doctor's death

1625
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Conspiracy on Sunday

1626
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,487
Is that all that

1627
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,047
Canadian lab stuff was misinformation on Thursday

1628
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
You have to believe

1629
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,863
That guy is a good source of information

1630
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
And someone used truck

1631
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,215
So yeah it reminds me

1632
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,263
When troyer's likes it all this

1633
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
All I'm doing is

1634
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,151
Taking direct orders from a guy who says he's right

1635
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,199
Percent of the time and it's the only one who

1636
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
Can save us from the tyranny

1637
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Members

1638
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,159
So we get back to I just want to take a little diversion there to here

1639
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:19,487
It's a little bit of that from Sunday to be like you were just talking about

1640
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
The Canadian lad stop

1641
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,559
Go f*** yourself with this

1642
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,351
Always all misinformation 100

1643
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
I was wondering like

1644
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
Why

1645
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
And actually the what

1646
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
What's a ended up

1647
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,007
Change it

1648
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
It relates a little bit to that article in visayan

1649
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,871
Also

1650
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
I got to weigh in

1651
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Alex reads

1652
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
On a back on

1653
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
February 20th

1654
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
Smoking Gun China bought

1655
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,647
Weaponized Wuhan virus from us

1656
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:52,767
Just a headline that Alex is reading but he never gets the contents of that article

1657
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,607
That's probably because the article doesn't have anything in it for him to read

1658
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,239
It's just an Infowars article with Francis Boyle

1659
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
That's

1660
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,615
Is reporting on his own interview just reading the headline

1661
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,383
I really don't think

1662
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
That's okay

1663
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,711
It's dumb and I'll explain the main argument over here in a sec

1664
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,039
But first I wanted to play you this intro for that

1665
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,183
They admit they originated an incredible job

1666
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Do you think it was done on purpose

1667
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:27,327
Understand who stands to gain he Bono as a as a law professor

1668
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
Who's who would do their who stands the game

1669
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Clip of Alex talking is the

1670
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
The cold open of the clip

1671
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:41,407
Hilariously the way the video is that it kind of sounds like he's asking who games Coronavirus

1672
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:47,039
If that's

1673
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:52,671
Completely disgraceful Behavior over the last month or so it's one of the best jokes I've seen on this show in a while

1674
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:57,023
If it's not it's just their subconscious might be trying to

1675
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
To tell them something

1676
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,095
As for the Smoking Gun

1677
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
That's just Francis Boyle

1678
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
Pretending to be science

1679
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
Here he is laying it out

1680
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
Talking this next

1681
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,751
The

1682
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
Smoking Gun here

1683
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,335
Page 11

1684
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Near the bottom

1685
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Paragraphs

1686
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,247
They provided a function

1687
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,295
To be Coronavirus

1688
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,343
Spreading inhuman Papi

1689
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
So let me

1690
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Before

1691
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Dana funk

1692
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
Ocean Technology

1693
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,263
Is DNA genetics

1694
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
Engineering

1695
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,847
Dangerous

1696
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,639
Biological warfare

1697
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
Substances

1698
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,503
Begin with something up of already been pathogen

1699
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
Turbocharged

1700
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
And

1701
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
Zeta function work

1702
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,415
Only be done

1703
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Safely

1704
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,487
In a bsl-4

1705
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,047
Or a bsl-3

1706
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
Facility

1707
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
So icy

1708
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
Clearly

1709
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
This is

1710
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
The Smoking Gun

1711
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,239
Zach the Wuhan Coronavirus

1712
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Came out of that

1713
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
Bsl-4

1714
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:19,968
So does boreal is found the words gain-of-function in a study posted on sciencedirect

1715
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,016
Facts about the 2019 Coronavirus

1716
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:26,368
Which is ultimately going to be connected to that 2015 article from the scientist

1717
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,184
Berghain a function study on the Coronavirus

1718
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,720
Price on a Coronavirus

1719
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,792
These two must be the same thing and I study

1720
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,584
2015 was clearly the cover for

1721
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
The creation of the virus that is now in Elk

1722
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,192
I can see how this game is probably super

1723
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,264
For fun to play use find words and ideas

1724
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
Really stoop

1725
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,128
Francis Boyle is a lawyer he has absolutely no background in science

1726
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,176
Any really should not be offering opinion

1727
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
About this

1728
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Because when he suggests

1729
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,040
That they're being a gain of function in the 2019 Coronavirus

1730
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,856
That's a Smoking Gun proof it was engineered is bioweapon

1731
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
Sounds like a f****** dumb dumb

1732
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:03,488
The function studies or studies were pathogens are given other properties

1733
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,512
To test their response

1734
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
But that's not the only use of the word

1735
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,376
This is really indicative of boil not even doing face

1736
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
Research on the topic

1737
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,448
Because if he had he could have learned very

1738
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,496
Quickly that gain-of-function is a

1739
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Category of mutation that happens

1740
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Naturally

1741
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
As is loss of

1742
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,480
When that sciencedirect article is talking about there being a possible gain-of-function in the 2019 Coronavirus

1743
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,040
That makes it more spreadable

1744
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,832
It's talking about natural mutation

1745
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,624
Could set it apart

1746
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,928
From other viruses and it's played

1747
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:40,096
This is a little bit outside of my pain from a science perspective so I consulted with an expert on these matters who maybe insist that

1748
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
Should I not call him

1749
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,448
Explain to me this 25th

1750
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
15 study was looking at stars

1751
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,288
And was based on a prediction that in the future

1752
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,592
Viruses like it would become less picky

1753
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
About 82 cleaver

1754
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:59,040
Study that they augmented in existence existing sars-like virus in a way that would make it more red

1755
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,088
Cleve by an Ace 2 receptor

1756
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:05,696
The goal was to evaluate the risk of other coronaviruses that were circulating in

1757
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Populations

1758
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
And what we needed to prepare for

1759
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,072
Or if this mutation to ace2 receptor livity did happen

1760
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,120
Gotcha gotcha

1761
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,936
Conversely the 2019 papers and now is

1762
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,984
An analysis of the current Coronavirus

1763
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,104
Which found that there is a mutation that has occurred that allows the virus to plead with pure insight

1764
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
Which is intrinsically differ

1765
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
Done the work they were doing

1766
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
15 study

1767
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
In effect

1768
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
The finding of the 2019 paper invalidates

1769
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
Hypothesis of the 20

1770
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
15 study

1771
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,904
Which is to say that the prayer study

1772
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,208
Predicted the future sars-like viruses

1773
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,000
What affects humans due to changes in

1774
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
Ace2 receptor

1775
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Where is the

1776
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
This paper is asserting

1777
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
That was incorrect

1778
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
Current Coronavirus

1779
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
Possibly as widespread as it is

1780
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Because it by

1781
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,080
Passes the difficulty of H2 cleavage altogether

1782
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,360
Going to fuel in route

1783
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
Instead

1784
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,176
Some scary application

1785
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,992
Inasmuch as it is a simpler process

1786
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
Could make this virus much easier for people to get

1787
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,320
It's not all bad

1788
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,160
Is it this is in case this is the fact

1789
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
How the

1790
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,744
2019 coronavirus is taken in by the body

1791
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,584
They're already a ton of treatments and preventive drugs that could be effective against

1792
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Pure and clear

1793
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
This essentially opens up

1794
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Ton of options

1795
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
For medical treatment

1796
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,704
If this paper

1797
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,472
Is shown

1798
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
Perfectly

1799
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
Alright

1800
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,640
I have no business discussing the nitty-gritty of this hardcore science stuff

1801
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
To put it simply

1802
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,480
These two papers are nowhere near about the

1803
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
Even if

1804
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,064
The 2015 study

1805
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
For proof of the

1806
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,880
The creation of a deadly bioweapon

1807
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,904
It still could not

1808
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,440
Possibly be the same virus

1809
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,976
As the 2019 Coronavirus

1810
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,304
Changes to Ace to cleavage in that study

1811
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
Literally nothing

1812
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Things to do with the furin cleavage

1813
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,424
Which is the discussion about the Coronavirus

1814
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,960
They're two completely different things

1815
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,240
Whatever

1816
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:58,848
Gain-of-function was being disgusting at unc-chapel Hill thing

1817
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
What is

1818
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
Fundamentally imprint

1819
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
Musically different

1820
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,712
Then whatever mutation is being

1821
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,528
Just because those same words are there that's

1822
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,808
The connection that's being made

1823
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,648
Okay that's why you don't listen to Francis Boyle right about science related

1824
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,208
All right so if I understand this correctly

1825
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Based on what you

1826
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
Describe to me the 2015

1827
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
Team paper in stock

1828
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,328
Talking about a stew cleavage

1829
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
Which is something that is less

1830
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:26,752
And something that we're not as prepared for sohee so they the study there

1831
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,288
Was trying to figure out

1832
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,104
If this is the way that it mutates then we

1833
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
We need to be able to

1834
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,920
Prepare for a stew

1835
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:38,272
Be an even leaving the sites

1836
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,880
Describe me in three between population

1837
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:47,488
So like something that would bind to simple.

1838
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
But the Cleveland is not

1839
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,864
Something that would be taken in by Ace to receptors in a bag

1840
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,680
Let's say is not the same as would be

1841
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,984
Taken in by humans through the ace2 receptor

1842
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
So there is differences there

1843
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,824
That cause

1844
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
An inability for one

1845
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,128
To effect

1846
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,920
Different animal

1847
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,480
Okay

1848
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Is

1849
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
Testing if

1850
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,576
I do it was easier

1851
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,904
Could humans be susceptible to other Coronavirus

1852
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,464
That were traveling it back to munity

1853
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
Now all of that is irrelevant

1854
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
Tuesday

1855
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
Mutation that's being disgusting

1856
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,864
2019 paper

1857
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,912
Just recent

1858
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
20/20 vision

1859
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Trisha

1860
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,008
So you would know the

1861
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
And I would never behave

1862
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,872
Like that they weren't going out to show and helping Miss inform people about an act

1863
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,152
Public Health crisis

1864
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
This is just

1865
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Depressingly bad

1866
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Or maybe

1867
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,016
Maybe Jordan

1868
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
I'm being real prick

1869
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
There's something more to this

1870
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,392
Maybe boil clicked on all the authors

1871
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
In the 2015 paper

1872
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,464
All their names

1873
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,256
Maybe you found something suspicious

1874
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,584
And it has all these people there from

1875
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,376
University of North Carolina

1876
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,216
It has someone from the Food and Drug

1877
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
And then

1878
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,128
The very bottom of the list

1879
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,432
Who is your mouth

1880
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
Obama

1881
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
Lishi

1882
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,672
Special pathogens and biosafety

1883
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,256
Institute of virology

1884
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Chinese

1885
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Roof on

1886
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
Unclear to me

1887
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
That this

1888
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
Scientist

1889
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,336
Institute of virology

1890
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
This

1891
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
Jay North

1892
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
Technology

1893
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
For SARS

1894
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,600
This University of North Carolina where

1895
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
No

1896
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,904
This is very interesting

1897
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,816
From the study which is ridiculous both

1898
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:04,704
You know if you actually read a study you can learn what individual contributors did for the study

1899
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
It's in the contributions

1900
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,056
Now you can't they just to list the author's note

1901
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,384
Clearly she provided some materials that were

1902
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,432
Need a name of the sequences of the Coronavirus

1903
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
They were studying

1904
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:20,576
Just left a matter of getting something from the

1905
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:25,952
That's why they got a credit on the final study

1906
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:31,584
Seems like such a lazy job

1907
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,912
Completely missed there's a second person on it from Wuhan involved

1908
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:38,496
G-Eazy was also an author on the study and

1909
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
Doesn't seem to realize that

1910
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,616
Also if he's going to say that anyone on their studies automatically somehow suspicious

1911
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,176
Why is he leaving off of another author that was named

1912
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,736
Was antoniou

1913
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:52,832
From The Institute of research and biomedicine in Zurich Switzerland

1914
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:57,696
Shouldn't I be a sounding off

1915
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Coming it's not

1916
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,280
Because I'm certain differences Boyle didn't uncover the

1917
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:05,632
He decided on a dumb conspiracy website needs work

1918
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:09,472
Let me get credibility by virtue position is this guy who

1919
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
Rhoda law

1920
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
This is all the fingerprints

1921
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:15,872
Lazy conspiracy site because they missed the second researcher from Wuhan

1922
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:20,480
This is what happens when someone scanning name two Seas one that points towards their preacher

1923
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,016
Conclusion that says good enough

1924
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,296
The dum-dum go by there

1925
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
Yeah but it'll print

1926
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
Yep there's nothing fundamentally suspicious

1927
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:31,744
Is about a couple of Chinese researchers having co-author credits on a paper that has to do with the Stars like Coronavirus

1928
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:35,072
If you don't recall the country has a bit of a history on the subject

1929
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,632
It makes sense there be a possibility of collaboration

1930
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,448
They had history

1931
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
Decided never to worry about

1932
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,032
The coronavirus like Behavior ever again

1933
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,056
There's nothing

1934
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
Fundamentally suspicious about that

1935
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
So far I See No Smoking Gun

1936
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,480
I don't even know if I see a gun without smoke

1937
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,040
No I I see an emperor without clothes

1938
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,368
So Alex asks

1939
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,208
Man this is Google.

1940
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
Google

1941
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,000
By the way.

1942
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
Stay right there

1943
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,328
I'm reading the paper

1944
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,168
But I'm just now reading it

1945
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,192
What

1946
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
And

1947
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,288
You talk about Smoking Gun this is the Chinese government

1948
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,080
Paying for the exact same thing

1949
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,616
U.s. lab

1950
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,408
Know how did you discover this

1951
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,200
How the hell

1952
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
You finest

1953
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Philadelphia

1954
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,040
Alex

1955
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
I told you

1956
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,392
It's part of my professional responsibilities

1957
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,928
Stay on top of

1958
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
Google

1959
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
So

1960
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,560
Came across it in my research

1961
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,632
Are the Joplin

1962
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:49,056
Alex says that

1963
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,360
Literally means you reading it

1964
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:56,224
We're just simultaneously a bad way to interview and a bad way to read

1965
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,040
Second boil is giving up the game

1966
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,392
If you watch the video when he's describing how he found this information you have a little smile on

1967
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,696
Myspace

1968
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,256
That you know all of the day's work

1969
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
O'Shucks

1970
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,072
Just what Heroes do stuff is horseshit

1971
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:17,728
This is a man who knows he can't tell Alex where he got the information from because if you did you would instantly reveal that he didn't do any research

1972
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,032
He just started on a conspiracy blog

1973
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,640
Weirdly an article covering very similar territory was published on February 15th

1974
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,688
A couple days before this took place

1975
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,712
On zerohedge

1976
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,808
There is this was about a Chinese researcher who theorize that the virus could have asked

1977
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
Escape from the lab in Wuhan

1978
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:39,488
Jiggly leash

1979
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,328
Which would explain why boil seems unaware of the other people on that study

1980
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,120
Boil is not a scientist

1981
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,168
He does not keep up with scientific journals

1982
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,240
Is just a conspiracy theorist who happens to teach law

1983
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,776
If you read some dumb s***

1984
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
Probably on zerohedge

1985
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:56,128
Now he's playing the role of a genius researcher who cracked the case without

1986
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Also

1987
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,504
That part about China paying for the study is because Boyle of cherry picking

1988
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
Stuff out of the acknowledge

1989
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:07,648
The study was partially funded by an award from the national Natural Science Foundation of China

1990
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,232
But now I kind of leaves off that they're also grants from the National Institutes

1991
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Institute of Aging

1992
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,352
That might sound weird but

1993
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:19,936
Probably because things like coronavirus is mostly kill the elderly

1994
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:25,568
Providing treatment and prevention for it would really effective drastically improving the lives of

1995
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
The older set

1996
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,920
That's where you're missing that's where you're mistaken

1997
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
See it's from the

1998
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,480
Institute of DEA

1999
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,064
Right there trying to get rid of old people that's why they

2000
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,088
Created this virus

2001
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,624
Scope tell italics

2002
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,256
Real answer for Francis Boyle

2003
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,560
Where did you find this

2004
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,632
Victor counting a bed but he does not get out

2005
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
Stay on top of

2006
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
Nothing

2007
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:57,568
I just came across a quadrilateral research

2008
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:01,664
More boil ship but I do want to say there's something particularly hilarious about this interview

2009
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:05,760
Alex is going on and on about as a Smoking Gun stuff and it's got the globalist

2010
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,576
The dead terrain they proved the virus is a bioweapon

2011
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:09,856
Instead of getting into the

2012
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,160
Specifics of the research of demonstrating their

2013
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,696
Surface-level things like

2014
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,280
I found two articles that have the word gain-of-function in them

2015
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,584
I saw Chinese person involved in the study

2016
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,912
Instead of doing any of that Alex has a plug for his product

2017
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,056
It's really easy to use this kind of conversation to drive sales what do you know everything that's happening on your show is

2018
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Real

2019
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
And that's what's going on

2020
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:36,480
Because if not I want to be like holy s*** holy s*** called call everybody

2021
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,552
You be freaking out because that's real

2022
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,880
Gives up that he doesn't believe the stories he's telling by his

2023
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,928
Look like lackadaisical sales

2024
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
5 minutes

2025
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
In the middle of this video

2026
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
There's another reality that we need to discuss

2027
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,864
And I think it might help

2028
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,656
Explaining Alex's unwillingness

2029
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
The virus news on this February 20th show

2030
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:01,312
I was speculating that it's because you know

2031
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,360
I'm sold out no real Financial motive

2032
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,664
Actually now that I

2033
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,968
You know I've watched this boil interview

2034
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,784
See that he's saying that there's a Smoking Gun

2035
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,600
The US sold this bioweapon to die all this stuff

2036
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,160
I think he realizes he's gone too far

2037
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,744
Oh yeah I think so the narrative is come to completion already

2038
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,304
That's a problem that is true

2039
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
This mystery is solved

2040
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,936
Yeah it was the government who sold it yeah this is an episode

2041
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,544
He already has the world's number one fake Authority on the science of bioweapons France

2042
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,616
Does boiled coming on his giving him absolute definitive

2043
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:39,200
Smoking Gun proof that not only is the Coronavirus lab-made

2044
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,224
But that Alex is

2045
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
Now in possession of the documents

2046
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
Hulu

2047
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,576
11 North Carolina created

2048
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
2050

2049
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,160
Chinese government pay for its creation

2050
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,440
There is no mystery

2051
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,512
It is assault case unfurl the sign mission accomplished

2052
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:57,888
According to the reality show boil is a credible source

2053
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,704
Chapel Hill made China bioweapon cuz they wanted money

2054
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,752
Problem with this is

2055
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,288
From a narrative standpoint

2056
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,568
There's nowhere good

2057
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,128
Alex

2058
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:11,200
And any real scientist that looks at it or any court or legal invest

2059
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,736
Alligator would laugh in his face

2060
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
So that route is not going to work

2061
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
That's One Direction you could go

2062
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,600
Trying to pursue legal action

2063
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,416
Against the folks in North Carolina

2064
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,952
Probably could result

2065
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,744
Countersuit

2066
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
So where does that leave sex

2067
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,840
If you're presenting to your audience that you have

2068
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Definitive

2069
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:35,008
Smoking Gun evidence of this is a bioweapon and you know they were selling it to China and it's the most deadly thing ever and well

2070
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
Number for Humanity

2071
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
Only be lone survivors

2072
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,664
Then what do you think the natural conclusion someone might come to it

2073
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,456
You need to go salt

2074
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:49,856
We need to stop that do not close to the point where your audience is going to start calling in and saying hey why are you

2075
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,648
Are you telling us to be telling us

2076
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:58,048
It kill those scientists

2077
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:58,816
Alex

2078
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:02,912
Proven piss you have it dead to rights Smoking Gun

2079
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,704
Why aren't you

2080
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,752
Call the f****** cock

2081
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:09,056
Snow

2082
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
No no no no

2083
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:17,760
Like it's a problem with his rhetoric has proven to monster blades

2084
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
It's killing

2085
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,832
Hundreds and hundreds of people and you

2086
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
Crack pecans

2087
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Receipt

2088
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,136
You need to

2089
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,928
Call Linda Bob's now

2090
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
That's

2091
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,976
Based on

2092
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,000
Everything that exists

2093
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,048
Turn Alex's show that's like where you should be

2094
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,608
So Alex is back himself into a corner with this

2095
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,656
Sensationalism of his coronavirus coverage

2096
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:38,496
According to Infowars this is a civilizational level threat

2097
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,776
Definitely a bioweapon

2098
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:44,128
And now he accidentally allowed Francis Boyle to come on in definitively name

2099
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
The culprits

2100
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,712
This kind of leaves Alex with only a few choices

2101
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,272
One is the continue escalating

2102
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,600
And risk one of his listeners taking him seriously and trying to hurt the folks

2103
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
UNC

2104
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,648
We just kind of a natural

2105
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,184
Conclusion the person would have left

2106
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
Another op

2107
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,536
Directions to throw boil under the bus and say that he's

2108
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,376
But if Alex does that he risks calling into question all the other stuff

2109
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
Stop the boil is told him about the outbreak

2110
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:11,008
It also risked his ability to have boil on when the next outbreak comes

2111
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,800
And he needs to sell it survival food

2112
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,848
I guess the third option is

2113
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
This

2114
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:20,992
Be a coward and ramble for about half an hour about how you can't cover the story cuz it's already installed case

2115
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:24,064
The only thing left to do 4 OZ rally the troops

2116
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,368
Isn't really really a good

2117
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,952
Case study for why even if your propagandist conspiracy theorist

2118
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,488
And even if it seems like it.

2119
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,536
Appealing to dabble in the pandemic album

2120
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,304
Break Stuff

2121
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,608
It's just not a good idea to go all in with it

2122
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
It's a delicate

2123
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,680
Conspiracy game and as you can see here

2124
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,008
It's not even a line that a pro like Alex can walk well

2125
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
It is

2126
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,360
If this is like a an episode of Law & Order where they

2127
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
They like

2128
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:52,224
Go through all the facts of the case and they solve the mystery and they're like alright we got them

2129
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,248
Be at

2130
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,856
Call Papa

2131
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,184
A real problem for Alex's narratives

2132
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
Like you can

2133
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
You can't do that

2134
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,792
Is it doesn't work what do you do now

2135
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,632
You agitate against the people in North Carolina

2136
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,400
I guess

2137
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,936
I mean what do you do

2138
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
I mean

2139
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,056
If you are actually telling me

2140
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,872
In real life one hundred percent true

2141
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
That

2142
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,432
You know exactly who is

2143
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,456
Infecting

2144
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Thousands of people

2145
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,296
Killing people all over the world

2146
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,368
And nobody is doing anything about it there's

2147
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,672
Two guys there who literally did this

2148
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,768
Let's go let's go find them

2149
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,560
I don't know what to do

2150
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,864
Call call the FBI

2151
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:44,704
It's not it's nonsensical and like there's really

2152
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
Nothing you can

2153
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,264
There is

2154
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,824
For Alex there are no real good options

2155
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,640
Just move on pretend it never happened

2156
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,944
Well I think he f***** them so

2157
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,760
Well of course he asked Francis Boyle.

2158
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:02,880
Exactly what I was going

2159
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:06,464
That's always Alex f*** himself over

2160
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,512
In between space

2161
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,912
Like I talked about it before the kind of panic that I would want is a kind of drives you to buy his product not point

2162
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,680
Where you like

2163
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,728
You feel justified in actually torture

2164
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,032
Tinkerbell

2165
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Kind of

2166
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
Fanaticism

2167
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,712
If it does, he gets to call it a false flag and you can know he can deal with

2168
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,736
General

2169
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,296
But he doesn't want that cuz

2170
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
It's worth usually

2171
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,648
So Alex has done with this now for

2172
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
For the time being

2173
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
Take a little bit of a diversion

2174
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:42,816
And they're down to the Sunday episode interview with boil because I think it's important

2175
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
He's not

2176
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,632
Explaining that headline be smoking

2177
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
King Kong

2178
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
I think it's

2179
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,264
We need to address it

2180
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
For the sake of completion with our coverage

2181
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
I don't get back to

2182
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,664
The February 20th show and Alex's back on the

2183
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Pardon Rodger

2184
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:05,856
Alright Trump is set to speak on prison reform

2185
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:09,184
And I'm sure they'll be Rogers.

2186
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:16,096
Do you got a special guest he said Randy credico is going to be ready

2187
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,728
I thought for sure

2188
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
In meantime

2189
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,080
He goes to call

2190
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,872
And this caller

2191
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Color seems weird

2192

2197
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,824
2018

2198
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
9 year

2199
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
Prophetic

2200
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,968
Oh yeah I heard of that

2201
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
I've heard of that what is

2202
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,832
ER full of s*** Alex's

2203
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
Nope

2204
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:14,976
Cosmic Cowboy trilogy

2205
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,584
Like eat just like things he couldn't

2206
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,400
Possibly be aware of your place

2207
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
I like that

2208
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,216
What do I have in my pocket

2209
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,776
Hahaha

2210
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,824
So Alex play the commercial

2211
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
To break

2212
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
And he comes back

2213
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
And this commercial is on the show

2214
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,456
This thing

2215
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:39,296
Is a new website operation win 2020.com

2216
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,088
Shark is basically to

2217
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,648
Just a place where people can get those duct tape sticker

2218
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Whatever the mouth

2219
01:40:54,656 --> 01:41:00,800
It's it's dumb he's just like we could we could take over these Trump rallies and we can take over everything with

2220
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,824
All we have to do

2221
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,104
Put stickers on a map

2222
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,408
What I will need to listen

2223
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,688
The commercial but there's one part

2224
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:13,088
2020.com

2225
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,584
Psychological warfare

2226
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,312
Steve pieczenik

2227
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,664
Recently sold

2228
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,760
Steve pieczenik about this and he loved he loved

2229
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:46,368
So you know it's great The Jug by plans

2230
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
Alright

2231
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,976
So after that commercial Alex gets around to his special guest

2232
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
And I was like

2233
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,096
Bucking Sweet let's get credit I love it

2234
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,888
Imma stop right here I'm going to be straight up with

2235
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,240
Dad this Gaston

2236
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,128
This ties into coronavirus and I'm crazy it is and then

2237
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,152
Weeks ago

2238
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,176
Almost

2239
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,760
Are the big food companies that sold out

2240
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:17,344
His f****** guest is the guy who runs my Patriot Supply

2241
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,624
It's just as food

2242
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,160
Prize guess

2243
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,208
Special

2244
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,512
Cuz he has a very important message

2245
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,816
And that is hey y'all

2246
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
Prices

2247
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
Going up

2248
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,192
Crisis going on

2249
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,008
What concerns me is where month-end of this

2250
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,312
Going down there going up

2251
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,640
And so you guys don't have any last night this morning

2252
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,944
You're going to have to raise price

2253
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Little bit

2254
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:44,992
Prices are going up

2255
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Prices

2256
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,808
Hold on

2257
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
Let me ask you a

2258
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
Have

2259
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,952
You and I ever done an episode where maybe Alex says

2260
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
Specifically

2261
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Beds

2262
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
These guys are great

2263
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,816
Cuz they are not opportunist

2264
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,120
Who are raising prices in the face of a

2265
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,312
Their price for the raw material is already gone

2266
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:12,384
Beaten path along eventually

2267
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
Or else they're never going to

2268
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,224
No

2269
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,528
So Alex asked him like

2270
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,624
What's going on with this situation

2271
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
This guy

2272
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
What a dumb dumb

2273
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
If you notice

2274
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:36,192
Or the number that are under

2275
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:41,056
Quarantine in the US

2276
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
500

2277
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
King Ranch

2278
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,920
Quarantine

2279
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,736
Why is there nobody adding up

2280
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,832
Truly is

2281
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,880
Inspections number

2282
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,488
I've no idea what self-quarantine means but I assume it'll be a figure that is

2283
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,816
Possible to report accurately

2284
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:06,912
How is anyone going to be able to really capture the figure of how many people are self isolating

2285
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,216
Outside the scope of our research

2286
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:14,336
As for the u.s. cases of the virus did do just making it up there people who stopped reporting on it

2287
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:19,456
There's an article from The New York Times headline coronavirus cases in the US Route 34

2288
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:23,296
There's an article in CBS News Right Here bad how many of people

2289
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,856
Many of the people who represent that optic

2290
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:29,184
From the previous figure are US citizens who were evacuated from the dime

2291
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:29,952
Princess Cruise

2292
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,512
Are now being quarantined in the United States

2293
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,072
There has been a media blackout about this is a topic

2294
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,632
Take a screen cover stories easily if you look for them

2295
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,472
However if you're trying to drive sales for disaster survival

2296
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,496
It's in your best interest

2297
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,288
To pretend that there's a cover-up going on

2298
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
Sunset

2299
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:49,152
Things are way worse than they appear.

2300
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:53,760
Is all disingenuous exploitation of a public-health event to translated into money

2301
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:57,088
These people should be ashamed of themselves and their sales practices

2302
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:03,488
Why are there any Muslim leaders condemning this tax of terrorism why none of them ever do it

2303
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,768
You never see him do that

2304
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,584
Time just open your

2305
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:08,864
Uline Pizza

2306
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:09,888
Dude

2307
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
They've recognized

2308
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,472
But there is

2309
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
People who are panic

2310
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
About this

2311
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,336
This situation is probably trying to

2312
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
Now they're not they wish it wasn't her

2313
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,736
You got the boy behind the scenes

2314
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Yeah

2315
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,088
Wig stand

2316
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,768
You guys are like we're going 24 hours a day

2317
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,376
We just wish this wasn't as big a

2318
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,656
Prices

2319
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
We're scared

2320
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,752
Talk about this

2321
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,848
Never seen anything like this

2322
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:55,200
We wish we were making so much money

2323
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:55,968
Freetalk

2324
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,648
Pick where you reveal your life before you even say so

2325
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,488
I think it's because he knows what he's doing is really gross

2326
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:11,584
Self-conscious about how f****** insane League roast this is

2327
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,936
The biggest food sale ever man

2328
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:20,288
Like everybody is making a run on this food and then I was asked this guy

2329
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,824
Why that is

2330
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,016
This is the biggest

2331
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,832
Brats

2332
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,856
Partnership

2333
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,648
I absolutely

2334
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
It's because people

2335
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:37,696
Don't really know but

2336
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,488
The transformation

2337
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:44,096
Are they getting lied to by Alex because people don't know

2338
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:50,496
Technically I do think he's accurate information

2339
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,032
The guy who selling your food

2340
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,128
Also speaking of bad information

2341
01:46:56,384 --> 01:47:00,224
Alex keeps talking about how all these other food companies they don't even have food

2342
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,272
They have long wait times

2343
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,576
I called a bunch

2344
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:06,880
Man

2345
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:13,280
It must have been really impossible to get ahold of anybody

2346
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,632
I called some other food companies other survival food companies

2347
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,656
And they all have

2348
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,680
About the same

2349
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,728
Perspectives that this guy does

2350
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,032
They are all but about attend

2351
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,336
Delivery window

2352
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,152
Up from whatever their normal Windows Coventry

2353
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,176
Love

2354
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,992
I did I discussed with a couple of them are like

2355
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,528
Like whether or not they have

2356
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,296
Food

2357
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Of course

2358
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,208
In order for us to continue to be a business we have to do the business

2359
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,232
You're right

2360
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,048
Survival food companies are going

2361
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,888
Increase of sales because of

2362
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,216
People like Alex reception

2363
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,264
But all of them have

2364
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,336
I don't know I did you ask anybody that directly of life

2365
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:03,456
Do you guys feel like this Panic is being pushed in your food is benefiting from

2366
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,224
I didn't ask

2367
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:09,600
That directly but one guy I talked to I did bring up that like the delay is because of

2368
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:12,416
Angry sale surrounding this Coronavirus

2369
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:16,512
So I think there is an awareness at least from one of the guys that I talk to you

2370
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
You can't not

2371
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:21,888
Where do right and I'm in hindsight I really wish I had asked

2372
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:29,312
If their competitors don't have who

2373
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,384
I was

2374
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
Trying to get like a gotcha

2375
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:40,320
Just trying to gauge like if I call these people will they have food

2376
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,856
And all of them

2377
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,136
Yeah of course

2378
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,464
I should have asked if they cuz I'm interested in if that's

2379
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:51,584
An angle that they all have supposed to just this is what my Patriot Supply is saying

2380
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,144
I'm not sure it's a whatever the case is there

2381
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:00,288
Now they all are I don't know what the other companies are doing my Patriot Supply in Alex Jones running

2382
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,080
A f****** disgraceful

2383
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
Charade

2384
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,896
Pretending that no one else has any

2385
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,432
Any food all that stuff is

2386
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,712
Such b*******

2387
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,480
Beds

2388
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
The food companies

2389
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,528
That have

2390
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,344
Souls or something along

2391
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:14,624
Minds are like

2392
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,928
Fully aware that this is all because

2393
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
Cuz of the Coronavirus

2394
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,744
And they're not

2395
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
Pushing it

2396
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:27,168
They're not trying to get that Panic out there but they're also not exactly like it's not right everybody calm down

2397
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:30,240
You know it's not wrong to make money off of

2398
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,264
Creased

2399
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,568
Demand

2400
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:39,456
Wrong to artificially created by the sort of action

2401
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,040
So they get done with this interview

2402
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,576
First comes back

2403
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,856
Time to get to this

2404
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
Trump press conference

2405
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:47,904
Is Trump is giving

2406
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,440
Speech by Criminal Just

2407
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,976
Now Mike down to this

2408
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,000
Because this clipped

2409
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,024
Take a ride

2410
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,096
Alex jumps in media res

2411
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
Live Trump speech

2412
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
And he thinks

2413
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,448
Trump is about to Pardon Rodger

2414
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:04,032
On on live air

2415
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,824
It does not go through

2416
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,640
All right ladies and gentlemen Now Music here as we start the

2417
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,968
Cramping a lot of stuff President Trump

2418
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,528
Microphone on a criminal

2419
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,600
Rodger Stone

2420
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,648
Three-and-a-half year

2421
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:22,464
Giving down by the Obama dropping

2422
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,232
Judge

2423
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
Jackson areas

2424
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
We are

2425
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,072
We are giving him

2426
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,864
Absolute consideration

2427
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,400
And I have a feeling

2428
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
He's going to get that

2429
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:45,248
AutoZone wifey

2430
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,064
Maybe somebody else

2431
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:48,832
Great gentleman

2432
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,136
Mets first thing they said to me when I walk in

2433
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,184
And dab

2434
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,720
But everybody knows who you are

2435
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,024
I Know Who You Are

2436
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,144
11 years

2437
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:07,776
Somebody completely different Trump is talking about some other guy

2438
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:15,712
Alex

2439
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:22,112
You felt like you had that Victory suit so tasty

2440
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:24,416
And even makes it way worse

2441
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,720
Of course

2442
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,488
Alex

2443
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,536
Can't deal with this appointment

2444
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,864
Alex thinks of this speech Trump is giving is going to be where he pardoned

2445
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,912
Rodger

2446
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,680
Stump speech

2447
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,448
Commencement

2448
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,520
Are they hope for prisoners graduation ceremony in Las Vegas

2449
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:43,872
Is just part of his re-election publicity speech

2450
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,152
Or even any of the parts

2451
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
Sounds like with blacko that he gave up it's just press

2452
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,272
So anyway

2453
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,552
In the middle of the speech

2454
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:54,624
Talkabouttd

2455
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,160
Hey

2456
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,440
People getting out of prison

2457
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:00,256
And they're good people. Maybe some of them are good people

2458
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:05,632
He had specifically people out of prison it's weird can't do that

2459
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,912
And we want to

2460
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,240
Bring returning citizens greatpeople

2461
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
People in many cases grape

2462
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
People

2463
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:15,616
I'm not going to be

2464
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,408
To politically correct

2465
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,760
In many cases

2466
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,856
Who want to rebuild their lives they want to rebuild their lives they want to help

2467
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:30,976
Stampy building

2468
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,256
He likes people

2469
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,560
They like sweating bad people out of prison

2470
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,960
I don't understand how whatever I mean bad is kind of a relative term I don't I don't know what the definition of

2471
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
This is such

2472
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:43,520
Text like I

2473
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,544
Oh this is

2474
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,104
This is how you can get away with so much

2475
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,664
Do a new evil thing

2476
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,944
Everyday and if

2477
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,480
Possible every 20 minutes

2478
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
You can't

2479
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,528
Possibly

2480
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,088
Imagine any f***

2481
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,112
President saying

2482
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:04,256
I'm going to let the bad people out of jail I'm just going to do what I can be politically correct and say everybody is great

2483
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:11,680
Hey I'm just going to let them murderers out and if they murder people you know what

2484
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,216
I'm not politically correct

2485
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,080
You can't possibly do that

2486
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
Come

2487
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,640
And so he notices

2488
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:24,480
Or I guess he knows that

2489
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,504
The audience

2490
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,088
Of this pizza

2491
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,880
He gives up a shout-out

2492
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,928
Ashara is weird

2493
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:35,488
And the job you do Miriam

2494
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,536
What you've done Sheldon just

2495
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
Overall is incredible

2496
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:45,984
Philadelphia

2497
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,544
Play Place

2498
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:49,824
Called

2499
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,152
Israel very much would you say that's correct

2500
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:57,248
Maybe I have to use the word love but place called Israel right your case

2501
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,528
What

2502
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,808
The fuc

2503
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,856
I understand

2504
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:04,672
Seems weird that he's banking Miriam and Sheldon Adelson

2505
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,000
Make a donors the GOP

2506
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:12,352
Gross but it turns out that the edelson's run a addiction recovery

2507
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:18,240
Place in Las Vegas events to Criminal Justice Reform

2508
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:20,544
It doesn't make sense that they would be there but

2509
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:24,128
Bank exam

2510
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,920
Very weird

2511
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:29,504
Unrelated cases

2512
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,296
8 bus

2513
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,344
To be so similar to what it was like

2514
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,624
To live during like

2515
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,952
85 to 88 with everytime Reagan Spokane

2516
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:40,512
Out loud and everybody was just like with the internet

2517
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:46,400
Yeah exactly it when you if you heard Reagan speak in those last three years you must have just been like

2518
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
I'm going to pretend that

2519
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,192
Didn't happen

2520
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Because that was

2521
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:55,104
Wario laughing at Nan last line people up

2522
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,176
Like what are you talkin about it's very upsetting

2523
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,200
Answer

2524
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,504
He starts talking about Rodger

2525
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Which is

2526
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,088
Not really what this

2527
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,368
Commence M for

2528
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
Seemed strange

2529
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:12,768
Do use it as a Pulpit to you know ramble about your own business

2530
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,352
But what he does is he says that he's not he doesn't use the word

2531
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,632
Pardon

2532
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:20,448
The great power the president has just refused

2533
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,472
Use the word pardon

2534
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,520
He says that he's not going to get

2535
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,800
Involved he's going to let the

2536
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,848
The process work its way out

2537
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,896
And then he starts rambling

2538
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:31,200
About the conspiracy theory about the

2539
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
The juror

2540
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,760
But she had a horrible

2541
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:35,552
Social media

2542
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,880
The things she said on the account were unbelievable

2543
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,928
She didn't reveal that

2544
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,464
When she was chosen

2545
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:47,584
And she's I guess from what I hear very strong woman very dominant person

2546
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,656
So she wants

2547
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,728
Did you get on then she became the four

2548
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,520
Person or woman

2549
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,800
Honda generator

2550
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,384
I assume

2551
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,664
A question

2552
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,200
You have any bias Japanese

2553
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,992
You didn't say that

2554
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:09,344
Lawyers on it

2555
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:14,464
But does this undermine our Fair system of justice how can you have Helen with her you finance

2556
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,024
Delete her social account

2557
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,328
Nope and when Rodger was

2558
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,120
Determined

2559
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,680
By the same jewelry to be guilty

2560
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Before the

2561
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,776
Judge issued a sentence

2562
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,592
And he was determined

2563
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:31,616
Abigail t

2564
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,664
And she started

2565
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,200
Going

2566
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,992
A little while

2567
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
Very happy

2568
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,320
And

2569
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:43,392
The same things that people said that strange

2570
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:48,512
That's strange and then they started looking at how can you have a jury pool tainted so badly

2571
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,840
You can hear like slight

2572
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,144
Nervous laughter from here

2573
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,424
Embear

2574
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,960
Graduation

2575
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:00,544
From a rehabilitation program like prison to release

2576
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:06,176
You're there because maybe one of your loved ones has been trying really hard to get their life back on track

2577
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,736
Is a big time for them it's very

2578
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,272
Do you get to Rican

2579
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,064
This person and bring them back

2580
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:12,832
Into

2581
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,624
Your day today lies and

2582
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,648
You got the f******

2583
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,416
President

2584
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:19,744
Rambling about a conspiracy theory about a juror

2585
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,864
How do you how do you handle for Isis

2586
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,144
This is this

2587
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,704
Him being a reality TV show star

2588
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,264
This is him like teasing it out like

2589
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,056
This is literally him being like

2590
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,616
I don't know maybe I'm the next Eminem 20/20 part yeah

2591
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,664
F*** you

2592
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
God

2593
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,480
Really really

2594
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:44,320
Disrespectful to the people who are they are for this event

2595
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:50,464
So I know it's probably maybe a minor issue but it it's not for them

2596
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:55,072
He does literally say that I'm not going

2597
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,632
Which means you probably going to Pardon them

2598
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:01,472
He doesn't say he's going to doesn't use the word party

2599
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:07,360
Alex seems to be pretty happy by this turn of events

2600
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,272
The insane one

2601
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,808
Back after this

2602
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,136
Handed to them Rogerstown doing three and a half years

2603
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,696
Alesana

2604
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
Call Jones

2605
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,232
This is

2606
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,512
Why the American

2607
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,584
Compliment your health with hemp derived cannabinoid oil

2608
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,984
It seems a bit deject

2609
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,544
Cuz I think he thought that press conference

2610
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,872
Who's going to be the way you can end the show

2611
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,688
And also like everything is not going the way he want

2612
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:47,808
Altitude on this episode

2613
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:48,576
Complaining and

2614
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,856
And arguing with

2615
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
The people

2616
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,416
He's now trying to do this

2617
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,232
Big hurrah with the Rodger that

2618
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,792
Not going

2619
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,840
I don't know

2620
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,632
Do that I can't cover the

2621
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:04,192
Coronavirus news that didn't go anywhere

2622
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,752
This is a bit disappointing show

2623
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,872
So Alex is Matt Bracken taking over in the fourth hour right

2624
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,152
What do you need like that

2625
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:20,320
So he goes back to the back

2626
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,344
To the batter's box

2627
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,880
He's getting ready to take

2628
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
Take some swings

2629
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
Go to calls

2630
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,256
I'll take a caller

2631
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,280
That'll be great

2632
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,560
Don't tell me I'm awesome

2633
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,352
Unfortunately

2634
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,888
He gets a stalker

2635
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,448
Oh God

2636
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:41,568
If it did work out any differently cuz I got a feeling he's going to be pardoned but

2637
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
You should stand in the law

2638
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,376
Mumbo jumbo

2639
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:09,728
Well if you if you directly

2640
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,264
Elven Council

2641
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,104
Hold on we don't need to get bogged down in legalese come and get close to that

2642
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,664
Corporation

2643
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,456
14th Amendment

2644
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:23,296
Stand up liking with the DMV like

2645
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:32,512
The globalist have all these legal he's thinking I get what you're saying a lot of his crew really

2646
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,560
The end of the day

2647
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,584
Country bar

2648
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:40,192
Values that we can deal with everything else that makes sense

2649
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,728
Here's what makes sense

2650
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,544
Alex can't tell this guy that that's all b*******

2651
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,616
Risks alienating a large

2652
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,640
Swath of his audience

2653
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:54,784
So he has to play this game where he thinks some of this is legitimate but he can never really be like yes this is what you need to do

2654
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,112
Send your social security card back to the

2655
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,184
Government specific on what it is you do

2656
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:07,840
A lot a lot of what you're saying is true know you lot of what you're saying is true give me one

2657
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,632
Pushing back on this

2658
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:12,960
Alienating the hard Sovereign citizens support that

2659
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,496
Exist within his audience

2660
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,568
And validating it makes it so like

2661
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
Insurance

2662
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,872
This stupid

2663
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,712
One last clip and it's Alex

2664
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,736
I don't know why he didn't

2665
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,272
Hang up on this dude

2666
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,064
Sovereign citizen

2667
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
Advice

2668
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,392
My advice would be

2669
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,184
Go home

2670
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:39,328
Somebody because you believe some things that are not based in reality

2671
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,352
Yeah that is true

2672
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,168
LCSW

2673
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,216
Part of the crown

2674
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:49,312
Okay

2675
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:56,224
A person like me

2676
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,296
Every week

2677
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,576
Make a 3-minute speech

2678
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,136
The world and I will dominate

2679
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:07,488
I would start a YouTube show

2680
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:09,792
Reading for stories on air

2681
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:13,376
I need Infowars stories on your own

2682
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,168
Create another Mediacom

2683
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:19,008
Read my s*** where I'm not allowed to do

2684
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:25,408
Also go down to city council and make yourself a public embarrassment for 3 minutes at a time and you'll

2685
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:27,456
Totally destroy the city council's

2686
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:29,248
What should I do here is my advice

2687
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,784
Work for me for

2688
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:37,184
And embarrass yourself in public so you're even more alienated

2689
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:42,304
Into the only listen to me and the other people agree with you to break system everybody else

2690
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,328
The lawyer

2691
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,352
Trying to kill you

2692
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,632
Bad advice

2693
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:52,800
Come to the end of this February 20th 2020 episode and I think that Alex is doubt quite well with sekot is best friend got cents

2694
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:53,824
3 years

2695
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,592
Placid

2696
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,896
This show sucks

2697
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,664
Oh man

2698
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
Why disappoint

2699
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,456
I just

2700
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,504
I have this dream in my head

2701
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,832
I really hope

2702
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:06,368
Trump abandoned Stone

2703
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,392
Because I think

2704
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:09,696
Stone might be the only ratfucker

2705
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,464
Able to wrap

2706
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:14,816
I think he's I think he's the only one who could really do it

2707
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:16,096
And I want to see what

2708
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:19,168
So much s***

2709
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:21,472
He's got so much

2710
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:25,056
Most likely yeah I do not have so much

2711
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,592
If your

2712
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,616
And Trump

2713
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:34,784
Assumption that you're making is also what animates all of the desperate defensive Rodger

2714
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,088
People like Alex and Owen also assumed

2715
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:42,208
He knows so much and that's why they have to bend over backwards to try and create these narrative

2716
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,256
Extend so far like taco

2717
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,536
Carlson even plays

2718
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,560
The same game

2719
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:50,144
Some of that might also just be based on the fact that him and Rodger friend

2720
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,192
It's hard to tell where the line of

2721
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:56,032
Year of what Rodger knows and personal Affinity where that

2722
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,824
Sprite

2723
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,640
Blind blur together just like in a personal sense

2724
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:04,736
I've like well I mean yeah if you if you're friends with Rodger Stone

2725
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:07,296
The longer your friendship goes

2726
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:09,344
Devore part of your friendship is like

2727
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:13,696
I wish I hadn't said that to Rex and I was like there's something there

2728
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,720
Jacob

2729
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:18,560
Hell I don't know anyway

2730
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:21,632
Just take that to Alex's. It's pretty disgraceful job.

2731
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,168
Trash

2732
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:25,728
Awful

2733
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,544
But until then

2734
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:31,872
Futsal

2735
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:34,432
We are fighting

2736
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:40,064
We are aware on iTunes

2737
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,112
Review donate to the show to the whole

2738
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,136
I think we would love it

2739
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:46,464
Special thank you to the guy who I cannot call the health Ranger

2740
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,352
I'm Leo I'm dvx Clerk
