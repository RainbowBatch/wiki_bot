1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,280
Beverages and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Did we are Dan Jordan

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
What's up I have a quick

9
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
Yeah what's up what's happening

10
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
What's the price for today

11
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
Vibrates but today is staying humble

12
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Hashtags

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Ball boy

14
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
I don't know about classic rock

15
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
And apparently I really stepped in it I thought I'd said that that's what I'm playing with fire is that about it

16
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Many people have pointed out a lot of whenever you missing something about

17
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Music

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
That's on me I don't know a lot

19
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
My parents were pretty

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
With that music growing out his brought up in the past

21
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,848
So my first album that I ever bought was Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill and my mom made me return it

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Bad influence

23
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Probably

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Probably everything by The Rolling Stones was a mysterious mysterious thing

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
Discovered some Beatles songs from Beatles Rock Band

26
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
I was going today it's kind of level

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
Naivete I have about

28
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
I would imagine that the Rolling Stones earlier

29
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
My dad might be like

30
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
F****** around with like

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
Pete Seeger

32
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
That's where we're at your dad in the secret prog-rock genre of just like somebody who would know

33
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
No one's around is like time to listen

34
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Send it yes

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
Like I'm going to give you my money

36
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
Okay well you know what you talk about that Blood Sweat and Tears

37
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,424
You did like Chicago and Iraq

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
I don't know

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Was he in the marching band

40
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
I can't remember anyway

41
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,848
My point is I'm sorry to everybody by disappointed by my nan

42
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Knowledge of

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
So how

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Okay

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,808
I will stand by my position that I don't like the doors

46
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
You claimed the song was the doors

47
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,000
It could very easily have been a completely disconnect what I was thinking about trying to play that game but then

48
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,376
Sincerity and aboveboard I have to admit that I did

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
F*** that up yet

50
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
Anyway Jordan

51
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
But I have these bright spot.

52
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Attaboy

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,920
We had a lovely time we got together and go about that

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Mortal Kombat

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Spotify

56
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
Fantastic time and I have

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
Decided that it is the worst movie ever made

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,000
It's the worst movie ever made but I was disappointed as hell

59
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
But In-N-Out this is how I'm thinking of it

60
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Alright

61
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Godzilla versus

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
This Kong

63
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Have you know what I got

64
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
I got Godzilla

65
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Versus

66
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Raider game

67
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Promise

68
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
And it delivered

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
And what I hear Mortal Kombat

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
I want a goddamn tournament there this was what I was screaming most of the movie

71
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,880
Spoiler alert for Mortal Kombat there's no tournament

72
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
It is a warning

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
Everything that really bothers me is like okay I get it some of these movies are such that like

74
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Maybe the tournament will be in the third movie

75
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Yeah they're good

76
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
It's cheap but whatever

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
It's not fair that this movie open

78
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
Opens up making a big deal about how the

79
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,407
The fate of Earth depends on this tournament

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Infuriated

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Furiated

82
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
We are going to lose that sponsorship money man we are

83
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
Nextaff K-12 videogame will not be

84
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Announce

85
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
Through us it was still fun though you know he likes it

86
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
I like the idea of getting overly excited for no reason almost as a bit about a movie coming out

87
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
It was fun to do that to watch a movie like

88
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
That was new

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,383
Yeah yeah I should have really long time we haven't watched a movie together in a long time

90
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
The forever this was your idea you were like

91
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
We're watching Boardwalk

92
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Yes you did

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
It's the worst movie ever made

94
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
So Jordan today

95
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
In the past

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
2003

97
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Continuing our March through

98
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
That time so we can learn I realized as I was

99
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
Listening to visit one of the things that I probably

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Beasley I'm the most

101
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Interested in is

102
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Seeing if that sort of

103
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Bizarre Christian extremism

104
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Exist

105
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Within him back

106
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
Eventually he thinks he's fighting the devil

107
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
To be what I'm most interested in

108
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Because if that's

109
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Been going on for 18 years

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Someone should have

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
You know

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
We should be

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
We should have a societal understanding

114
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
That this guy thinks he's the

115
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
F****** Messiah

116
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
It has nothing to do with bank really totally

117
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
It's fighting the devil

118
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
States

119
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
It's complete nonsense

120
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
With a little thin veneer of political Intrigue in order to trick people into thinking that what they're involved in isn't

121
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Extremist

122
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
Missing signs and they've been simmering light

123
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
Slight little bit since you were being ungenerous perhaps you could.

124
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Put that in the in the

125
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
The holster what happens here on May 6th

126
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
See if we can

127
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
So we can find any more clues and then I get a better picture of what's going on

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,567
First I got to give some shout-outs to some blocks

129
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
What year is the Jordan need to livestream

130
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151

00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
You're not about to walk

132
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,807
I'm a policy wonk very much and that's a good idea got to require a premium

133
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
They also screams from Chrono Trigger

134
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Is it

135
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
It's pronounced 88 even Tie fighters are now

136
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Tie fighters thank you so much of an apology walk

137
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
I don't want to play more development through the

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,079
Halloween controversy

139
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,759
I'm a policy wonk

140
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Twosome technocrats

So first we got Jewel see thank you so much you are now technocrat

Heroin

Freakishly large

00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Thank you so much Joel

149
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
The music skull Durand Bryan

I love you so

152
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Where is narcotics drop

153
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Hyperplasia

154
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Contact

155
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
More terrifying go to just somebody in a monotone yes I'm a maniac hasn't been earlier in this the episode before that

156
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Open out at all no

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
What could you listen to presentations you like

158
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
This guy is

159
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Being crazy

160
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
No you're not

161
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,591
Serialized content

162
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
But he has been a maniac

163
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
The best

164
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
At least we're aware of the bathroom

165
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,039
Siberian the future I will be so nuts that I have to apologize now

166
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Exactly

167
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,647
Three starts off the show and I honestly think

168
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,231
I'm working on Siri this is another thing I'm tracking as I'm going back to the

169
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
The past

170
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Make Joe Rogan might have ripped off Alex

171
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Crime

172
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Bacteria

173
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,471
So I think I think Rogan might have stolen calling his show powerful

174
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,335
2003 this is before the Rogan Experience powerful Joe Rogan

175
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Experience

176
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Powerful broadcast here

177
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
I don't think so

178
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
The bechdel group

179
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Took the story here is Alex's talking about it begins by Jane Mayer in the New Yorker

180
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Where she covers the connector

181
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
In between the bin Laden family and the back door

182
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
About to be Global Construction and engineering company to which

183
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
The US government recently awarded its first major multimillion-dollar contract

184
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
To reconstruct war-ravaged

185
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
This was because

186
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Laden family head invest

187
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
10 billion dollars in

188
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
In a company called

189
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Fremont group

190
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
Which began as a subsidiary of Bechtel but it been a separate entity since

191
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Since 1986

192
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Some of the board

193
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
Members of Bechtel we're also board members of Fremont but they weren't

194
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Connected businesses so

195
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
An investment in one isn't necessarily an investment in the other

196
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
There's a lot of reasons

197
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Point fingers at McDowell and spec

198
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,583
Spectre not above board in their dealings with this tenuous connection to the bin Laden family is not one of them

199
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Even if you connect them conch

200
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Greatly to Fremont then you still need

201
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,751
Need to demonstrate how the money the bin Laden family invested in Fremont

202
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
Has any connections to the actions of Osama bin Laden

203
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
There's so much work that you still need to do to make this a CV

204
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Conspiracy

205
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
And all Alex is doing is just like pointing at

206
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Someone else's headline and then just

207
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
Construing it

208
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
More like

209
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Oh I heard

210
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,231
That the McDowell group was into some s*** or I'd be like oh yeah of course they were most business

211
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Does commit Financial crimes

212
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
I don't think their financing

213
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Terrorism

214
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,679
More expensive than just committed Financial crime

215
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Conspiracy that there toward the train

216
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
To dance around without explicitly saying it is like

217
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
So this Bechtel group they do a lot of

218
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Construction project

219
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Multimillion-dollar

220
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Construction project

221
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
So it was about the Twin Towers

222
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,575
If they were actually fake and they were made at it was a small model that was

223
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
No no okay

224
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Like

225
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Funding of this is related

226
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,327
To causing the need for the construction should have closed loop

227
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
The conspiracy of being hinted at without actually overtly saying because

228
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,775
Okay now hold on if you were to actually assert that

229
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
People be like

230
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
You can't you can't prove any of this

231
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Like Alex's doing then

232
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Yeah we kind of get away with

233
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
Approving a case when you haven't done anything

234
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Follow the money

235
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
There's a

236
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,255
Few million invested in a small company that's terrorism okay alright fine

237
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
So Alex is this guy who

238
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
Has always been right about everything and he's

239
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Just like

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Just waiting

241
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
To be proven right

242
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
All the time

243
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,791
So interesting to see how clearly above the left-right Paradigm Alex's back in two

244
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,375
Can't trust any liberals

245
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Consistent about how the left right thing

246
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
Just going to lose definitely doesn't seem like a dishonest manipulative

247
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Extremely right-wing a******

248
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,895
The truth is that Alex does dislike the left and the right

249
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
You can tell

250
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
But it's important to recognize what he's

251
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Complaints are

252
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
He hates the last because he hates

253
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
It's the right because he doesn't feel like they're far enough to the right

254
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Mother secretly humble

255
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
Wright also 18 years later on our passports do not include iprint

256
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,119
Things Alex has not always been right about

257
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
What's this time. Alex

258
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Wants to hear George W come out and be like segregation now

259
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Then and then he be

260
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
Well above the left-right paradigm

261
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Certainly Beyond

262
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,343
We have another echo of the past that certainly plays in the present-day quite a bit

263
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
That is the idea that you pay with cash

264
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Somewhere

265
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Your

266
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Going to go to prison

267
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
So that is not happen

268
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Yeah

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,639
I mean Debbie didn't India Fraser old paper money

270
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,735
I didn't know motor just be like of one daily

271
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Just like no paper money

272
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
I am not sure if that's been a full and total

273
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,999
I know the during covid there has been a lesser use of money

274
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,119
Use paper money totally fine

275
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Drink that I am enjoying right now

276
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
I was kind of

277
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Suspicious about this and

278
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
It takes him until

279
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
The end of the episode to actually

280
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,223
Talk about what this article is about we can close this way

281
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
He's reading this anyway it sounds like

282
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Poorly written

283
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
An attempt at humor

284
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
But also know that like

285
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
I got editorial kind of thing

286
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
Here's basically what's going on

287
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Bromley

288
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Mutant

289
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
I once again I misinterpreted

290
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Find something lady

291
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
So that's the story

292
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Some guy was

293
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
That you learned that at Saks

294
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
They don't accept cash on things over

295
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
350

296
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Sew in

297
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,015
Infuriated

298
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Just can't imagine what

299
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Opening something

300
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,559
The mail

301
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,399
Hey Rick if you can't find something more than 350,000

302
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,263
That's fine that's totally fine

303
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
But I'm slightly annoyed people buying things more than 300

304
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
$50 also if I were someone who was

305
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
Running a store like that I might be suspicious

306
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Someone paying $1,000

307
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Attached

308
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Of course

309
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Why wouldn't you be

310
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
I wouldn't judge them

311
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
I'm too much but I

312
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
This money might be dirty

313
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
So Alex gets to talk

314
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
It's more about the bin Laden family

315
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
He does not cover this story about Bechtel in-depth or anything

316
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
What does ramble a bit about

317
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Bin Laden how do you CIA

318
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,671
I love the song Ramble On do you know did that doors

319
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,663
That they carry out dangerous world

320
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Ygopro

321
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Amanda her magic

322
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
I thought that's a lot of stuff

323
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
Being sad

324
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
You have to be on the moon

325
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Did not know that he's committing worldwide

326
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
As we speak

327
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
Not at all arise didn't simply quite strongly that did londres

328
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Steve some training from the CIA back in the 1980s

329
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,439
When Bin Laden and the mujahideen were fighting against Soviet communist right

330
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
You can even be

331
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,095
Real pretty reasonable and assuming that there's some of that financial support from the USDA to find its way to Bin Laden and

332
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
His fighters in that. Short as part of operation

333
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Asian Cyclone aimed at fighting communism

334
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Broad with the help of proxy arm

335
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,871
A strong argument could be made that the formation of al-Qaeda was at least partially the effective blowback

336
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
From these behave

337
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Indian operator

338
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
The thing is that one can accept

339
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:34,623
The conventionally understood history of Bin Laden and his connections to the USA Embassy I am still recognize that

340
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
The claims Alex is making

341
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Are unfound

342
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
Sing that stupid geopolitical decisions in

343
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Inspired by the anti-communist

344
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
History of the Reagan Era led to a

345
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Racine and severe consequences

346
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
Is not the same thing as saying that I was Sullivan Lawton within the CIA

347
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Very

348
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Yeah it's wild to me to go to like

349
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Osama is still working

350
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,967
For the CIA instead of immediately assuming that the CIA made a stupid and short-sighted

351
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
The decision

352
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
That is

353
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,575
Perfectly in line with literally every decision that

354
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
Yeah yeah it's pretty say makes sense there's narrative

355
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Consistency there

356
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,327
So the second Play Metallica's making in that Cliff is that there's no construction that happens in the Middle East without the involvement of

357
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
The bin Laden family

358
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Not why

359
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,495
The bin Laden family is a majority owner of the bin Laden Group Global holding company

360
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
Formerly known as Saudi Bin Laden

361
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
They do have interest in a lot of construction in

362
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Some incredibly high-profile projects like the

363
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
The Jeddah Tower pure but it's a little much

364
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Pretend that they run

365
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
A complete record of all these

366
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
Orchard project to the middle

367
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
Does not want to learn about Sovereign wealth

368
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,999
A Forbes Middle East estimate recently put the total value of project in the Saudi Arabia and

369
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Construction Market at one point

370
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Trillion-dollar

371
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
And that's not even considering like

372
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
713 billion + UAE project

373
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
578 billion in Egypt

374
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:59,615
It's a fun story to tell the bin Laden family has a Stranglehold on the market and no one makes anything without their approval Natalie

375
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Vix

376
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Not real

377
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,039
It's just a cartoonish exaggeration with the news that was reported by the ties between the bin Laden family in the back door

378
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
Inflate

379
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Into being something

380
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
Completely different than it actually is

381
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
There problems with the interconnectedness of these boards and you can make some good arguments about the way contractor beta Don and doled out

382
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Another sort of conversations are completely

383
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Impossible

384
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
If a point that you want to start from his opinion

385
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,055
You're trying to understand the real world

386
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
And that's what Alex is

387
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Ushering his audience

388
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Extort

389
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
And also like

390
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Construction Group

391
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
In Saudi Arabia are run by the government

392
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Yeah it's not the bin Laden family

393
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Governments

394
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
Using this for their own personal gain

395
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,351
Either way that makes perfect sense if you know anything about the history of that government

396
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Jordan

397
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
We've heard a lot about Alex

398
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
Predicted 9/11

399
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Sure email

400
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
We know that

401
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
About a month before

402
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
He did Bill Cooper saying

403
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
Exact same stuff on his show

404
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Several times

405
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
Times before that Osama himself was probably

406
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
You could assume that if your

407
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Alex

408
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,135
Text Cliff doctor little bit about where he got some of his ideas

409
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Hardball

410
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Sorry Gary Hart

411
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Chris Matthews having a MoMA

412
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
Yeah it was this a segment on the show back then but the CFR moment

413
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Alec saw this

414
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,736
Latency for moment happening in public

415
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
That there was going

416
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
Tubi

417
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Sunday

418
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Is a slightly different story

419
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Bloody Jay

420
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
God gave you a vision

421
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
A little added

422
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Get on my knees

423
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
That place and then

424
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
You can actually see everything going on in the universe

425
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
Plugging directly into the source

426
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,744
And others that time but he went on Rogan show and said that he got it from a dream yes there is that was a two-hour

427
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
You think I did it in July 25th

428
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
2001

429
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,704
Romanatwood on Erin's World Trade Center by know she is up and load them on Shelly's Wars

430
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
And I said I just got this from analysis information but I can

431
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Having a drink

432
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
I love the of the towers smoking on us

433
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,736
I love the idea that in the present day when he's talking to Rogan to try and be interesting he's like

434
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,832
I claimed back then that it was based on analysis but I just had this dream

435
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Over Dover gets looking back at

436
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
2003's saying that is based on analysis

437
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
Episode

438
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
100%

439
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,080
Strangely conclusive proof that maybe he wasn't lying in the Press

440
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
I was like in the past

441
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Okay I'm coming clean on this

442
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,552
No matter what I do it's pasted alive

443
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Yeah I don't know

444
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Quicksilver

445
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Did you ever notice how a narcissist

446
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
As time goes on like

447
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
The people in their story send

448
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
To disappear and it's just

449
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Them

450
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
You know that Gary Hart just disappears into the past

451
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
Don't worry. To worry in the present-day was all me and God literally everything it was

452
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
Going to happen so spectacular

453
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
He gets handjobs from the Arcana

454
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Angel Michael yeah

455
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
So we have this in

456
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Interesting dynamic

457
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
Back in the past

458
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
Alex is still trying to

459
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
Pretending the left and the right of the same

460
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Kind of game

461
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
To get into that a little bit and I

462
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
I think it's a little silly

463
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Okay

464
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Sounds like the past

465
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
I do like

466
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
We can kind of boil it down to the conversation is still between Liberty and tyranny

467
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
You're just pretending that the right doesn't associate with tiridates

468
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
That's kind of your problem here

469
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
You guys just ride to Institute a theocracy

470
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,696
I think we know what the left-right Paradigm is Liberty versus freedom

471
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
It's a little it's a little bit strange

472
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Yeah

473
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
I would say that the superficial

474
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Analysis at bat

475
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Love you

476
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
The way he's trying to do

477
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Take the left and the right has the same

478
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Is essentially meaningless

479
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
I don't know I don't know

480
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,152
I don't know what how he knows what they were teaching at universities 100 years ago

481
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,992
I would say that he is not somebody I would take

482
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
As a as a credible Source on that

483
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Sure

484
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,440
Assessment

485
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Care too much of

486
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Simplistic

487
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Left-wing government that have eroded ended

488
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
Dictatorships and right-wing governments have also wrote it.

489
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Dictatorship

490
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Play some superficial similarities

491
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,336
Between them that doesn't mean that they're all.

492
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Policy wonk

493
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
You think that he would bring up specific things

494
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
That they agree

495
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
Do superficial things like those big jails in

496
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
People in by police in black black uniform

497
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
To keep us in mind typically speaker

498
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
Someone is trying to tell you what there is no difference between X and Y

499
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
There's a really good chance

500
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
Exeter super on the side of X or why they're usually not in the middle or no

501
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
Neutral extremist for x or y

502
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Usually they go from

503
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,616
There's nothing between me there's no difference between X or Y

504
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
I know they put

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,944
She strongly towards X or Y

506
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
It does seem like that is about

507
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
So Alex is trying to make this point they're like the last

508
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
In the writer the same

509
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Blah blah blah

510
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Fascism and communism

511
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Same thing

512
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
And here is how Alex

513
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Makes that argue

514
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
Nazi operations

515
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
No help at all

516
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
So Alex is really bad at his job

517
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Pink lips like this

518
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Yeah I mean by Prescott Bush

519
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:54,240
Almost all the Nazi operations globally

520
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,640
Did he run the cloning program and Brazil to totally okay good

521
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
If you pay attention to that clip

522
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
Do you see one of the ways that Alex

523
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Flies

524
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
You take something that is true mainly the Prescott Bush did indirect business with the Nazis and embellishes it and

525
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
Completely insane way like claiming he ran almost all their operations globally

526
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
The assertion that Alex is making his nonsense

527
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
He's saying the Prescott Bush profiteer by trading with fascist and that other Rich families of profiteer by trading with communist

528
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
This must be the same

529
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Same thing it means

530
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Nothing is a silly Ark

531
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
No difference

532
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
The argument that fascism and communism are the same because Alex believe them both to be

533
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Commanded

534
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Control Sim

535
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
System

536
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Equally meaning

537
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:43,904
Alex threw out that term a lot but it really is just a military term that the Joint Chiefs of Staff defines us

538
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,304
Quote command-and-control is the exercise of authority and Direction by a properly designated Commander over assigned forces

539
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Anacapa

540
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
Schmidt definition

541
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
The term has a broader understanding outside of strip

542
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Strictly military

543
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
Situations to me

544
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
Someone direct other people to get a task

545
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,848
Done seem very self-explanatory whenever you just

546
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Think of words

547
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Concealed how they mean thing

548
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
If this is a big

549
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
Similarity that Alex has the teeth

550
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
Thanks makes communism and fascism the same

551
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,088
Have a short list of other things that also must be the same as the Nazis

552
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
School

553
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Any job where you have a boss

554
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Troop Hospital

555
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,096
A form of acting where there's a director

556
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Every country in the world

557
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,984
That last one

558
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,360
My focus on what he thinks is the only relevant factor in these two systems Alex is actually

559
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,176
Obscuring the much more real and much more important difference

560
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Between them

561
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
I think what Alex is trying to

562
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
Expresses the communist countries have what's known as a command economy

563
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
Where the government decides what should be produced

564
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
And how much as opposed

565
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Letting go

566
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,256
This is a defining aspect of Communism as an economic system

567
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
The problem is when you try to juxtapose that with fascism

568
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Isn't an economic system

569
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,008
Don't know if you look at the fascist countries during WWII for example you can see massive differences in the economic models

570
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Employed

571
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
What Alex is trying to

572
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,384
Expresses the communism by definition involves a command economy

573
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
And that the Nazis also had a fairly

574
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
We command base

575
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Economy

576
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,808
The differences that within communism is an element of the economic ideology

577
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
But in the case of group like Nazis

578
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,928
It was just used because it was necessary to run an economy Olmos

579
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Entirely based on War

580
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
We did the same thing.

581
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
World War II

582
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Yeah it was alright was great idea

583
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,168
Workout for everybody involved face is not a meaningful substantiv connection

584
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Between these two things

585
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
I'm really like I was listening to this episode I was trying to give

586
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
Alex Affair reading

587
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Ride it

588
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Just what are you saying doesn't

589
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,920
No I mean based on his definition of

590
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Command and control

591
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,784
Fundamental idea of laws

592
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,672
Because that is a designated body telling you what you can or cannot do

593
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Like that simply cannot exist

594
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Austin Hays

595
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Concept I think if you went

596
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Too far with it yeah you probably

597
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
Get to that that argument

598
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
I think I

599
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
I could get him to that

600
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Oh and other thing that's

601
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Commander control

602
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
Judges

603
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,712
You're right all law should be abolished okay Alex that was

604
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Mypoints

605
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
But fair enough

606
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
Socialism

607
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Always leads

608
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Fascism

609
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
The more accurate

610
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Call work

611
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,600
But this conversation

612
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,672
Probably impossible to have cuz I don't think Alex is using any of the

613
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,232
These terms in the way that anyone else would

614
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:05,888
Is it completely made up claim that I was paddling they can't backup at all unless he uses completely absurd definitions of the word so

615
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Socialism and fascism

616
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,264
I think anybody would agree with him whatever it is he doesn't like

617
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
And if you can Define it as something

618
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,616
From that he will tell you that that's

619
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
The secret way they talk about it

620
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
Cover up that what they actually mean it

621
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
Sure

622
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Alex

623
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
One of the big breaking point in his career 10 times the

624
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
That communism is

625
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Half Baked like one of the most

626
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Argued about in

627
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Books over and over and over again

628
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,448
Refined and reinterpreted things

629
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Is half

630
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
F****** babes like

631
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,336
Karl Marx beta 3 3/4 of Das kapital it was like

632
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
That'll do

633
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,760
Like I tried I'll put it out there and everybody else can finish the last

634
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,880
45 different between I disagree with this Attitash picked

635
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Satisfactory that's alright

636
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
The beat that dead horse real

637
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
I say

638
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
May

639
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Nope

640
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,264
Alex girl broke into Bohemian Grove right story

641
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Nobody's around

642
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
And

643
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Now that we're in the future

644
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
He did it completely by

645
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:25,504
Itself no other journalists their whatsoever who were also documenting this

646
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Tilex in the present-day would like to say that he was going to pay the first person to ever break the story wide open but it.

647
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,648
How you'd read about it in the mainstream British media

648
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
Him to do the story not think of this by himself whatsoever hear you're a weirdo

649
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,936
Never do it from the British media these are some of these little differences

650
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Past version

651
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
The stories in prison

652
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Seems like things change

653
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Sure but something that doesn't is weird

654
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,664
Alex has a herb store or like

655
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Like a

656
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
I don't know I guess they have some colloidal silver and shower

657
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,064
Sure they sell videos he's running an ad for

658
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112

Play Spotify

670
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
Maybe Alex was

671
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Why would you have that as a

672
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
The sponsor

673
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
If you if they weren't like

674
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
Like a Christian identity

675
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
I type of herbal shop

676
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
Natural place recipe

677
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Very weird

678
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Very weird

679
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
I can't get over the idea of like Kellogg's just

680
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,216
Cornflakes Thousand-Year War almost ended

681
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
And if you want more Kellogg's Cornflake we will defeat

682
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:04,480
My lucky charm it is strange

683
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,856
Tough time with the Iraq War and all this

684
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Because he hates the people who are doing it sure

685
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
David David George Bush

686
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Not really and all that

687
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
And I think

688
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:21,888
Value free talking a little bit too much I think that Alex reveal certain ways in which

689
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
His ideology is in

690
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
Consistent with what he wants the audio

691
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Dance to believe it is

692
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
So Alex seems like he's

693
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:02,592
Fine with the idea of colonialism

694
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
They're installing democracies apartheid

695
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
Sure only in the case

696
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
The government was

697
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
Doing the things that he doesn't like

698
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,928
So I guess it's a position can't possibly be to meddling in the Affairs of other country

699
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,976
For regime change in nation-building

700
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:24,096
Write something to eat hypothetically okay with but he will pretend that he's not

701
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Yeah

702
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
I would be interested to know what Washington would consider a hemisphere is argue Alex's argument again

703
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Iraq War

704
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Seems to be

705
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Vaccine

706
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
It doesn't it does not sensible

707
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
No no no it doesn't

708
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
People like he's like a

709
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Hey

710
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
We should be colonizing

711
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,904
Central South America is what we did no other hemispheres watch

712
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,000
No I think he's saying that if our country was run the way I want

713
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
Tattoo

714
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,608
Yeah we could go ahead and put into my procedure on the Worldstar

715
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
I just don't like these people

716
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,568
It's a it's an incoherent silly ideology that problems really fat

717
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
Yeah it is to buy Greenland Trump is in office

718
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Phuc yea it's

719
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,088
It's that kind of nonsense if I call that is kind of what you believe is long as it's

720
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
As long as it's your idealized

721
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Christian

722
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,000
Authoritarian government

723
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,072
Government with all kinds

724
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,472
The colonial expansion everything's one hemisphere don't care at all about the idea of

725
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Freedom

726
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Termination

727
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Yeah

728
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
It is like okay I get that we both

729
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,688
Don't want the Iraq War but I don't want it because

730
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Millions

731
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
The people are going to be slaughtered

732
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
For no reason and you don't want it be

733
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,344
Because you don't like the guy

734
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,416
I don't think we necessarily agree.

735
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,744
I don't think that's a good

736
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
It's very sense

737
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
It makes sense

738
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,216
This is kind of how I'm not if I'm not ascend

739
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,288
Ended by this necessarily sure advertising

740
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
His product

741
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Which are like his DVDs and

742
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Make sense

743
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
To be like there's more information

744
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
On this

745
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Makes more sense than him

746
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Constantly throwing

747
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
2 pill commercials

748
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
At least they're still hypothetical in

749
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Information

750
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
To be found here although I think

751
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
So I just documentaries he proved that the globalist

752
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Scary dolls 911

753
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
911 I don't recall that

754
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,768
But do you recall when he did that interview a couple years back

755
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
With Patrick bet-david

756
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
And Patrick bet-david ask him

757
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Who did 9/11

758
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
Who was really behind the 9/11 would what's your studies over the years

759
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
And Woodruff

760
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
I don't know

761
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,152
Oh are we using watch your DVDs then you should watch the the proof

762
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
You make

763
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
It seems like you would stick to

764
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
To the proof

765
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
I would say that maybe

766
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Maybe you were wrong

767
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Have you didn't prove it

768
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,768
Okay my documentaries going to approve everything

769
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,584
World war is coming there.

770
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
Now I mean obviously the capital gains tax

771
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Should be about 45

772
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
50%

773
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Temperature in there

774
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,616
It's it's fun

775
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,688
Forget that he proved who did 9/11

776
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
Seems like a big thing to remember

777
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Oh well

778
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Palace Casino

779
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
I think I've watched those DVDs and I don't think I know either

780
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
His proof

781
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
In quotes yeah I would like

782
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Redacted page

783
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
This is what I

784
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,192
Here's our first indication of

785
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,984
Something not being quite right

786
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
In in Austin

787
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Sure

788
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Alex is going out to break

789
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Okay there

790
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
The forces of Satan

791
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
Could pull that off as being like look at him he's making that exaggeration come on we've all used

792
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
Flowery language

793
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
And it's going out to break

794
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
Pump up cardigan

795
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
It sounds like a reasonable thing that you would say if you were just pumped up but it also does feel like this is a little bit more than I

796
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
I've been

797
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Giving a pass

798
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Edgewater

799
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Icon fighting against

800
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
The forces of Satan

801
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
He's not

802
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
As literally

803
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
He's not

804
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Saying that as part of

805
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,207
A 15-minute Ranch you're sure

806
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
It is just going out to break but it made me worry

807
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,351
It could be hyperbole of course of course however

808
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
You can't miss the forest

809
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,983
It's for the trees if you will Dan VA

810
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
So Alex Goes to calls

811
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,895
Like I think I brought this up before but there's such a sensible formula to his show at the

812
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
This point and that is he'll rant about something

813
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
For a little while

814
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
And then go to calls

815
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
And then maybe the caller says something that he can talk about for a little bit longer he'll read a headline or two then go to a car

816
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Call get maybe a reaction

817
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,839
Revival lead into a rant there is just a fluidity to it that makes sense

818
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Where is Maui

819
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399

820
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:52,287
F****** long jumper cables

821

Answer this call her that Alex goes through

824
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Displaying the show brings up Rush Limbaugh

825
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
What do you think Alex

826
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05,087
But Rush Limbaugh giving him something to steal

827
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Play driving in my car and

828
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Turn on

829
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Rushlight

830
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Carolina

831
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,303
He was talking about

832
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
No

833
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039

Rush Limbaugh

839
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
Right standing next to Bill Maher's

Is people who are left

841
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
Beyond all reason

842
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,591
You get this sentence like okay here's where the denial of the left-right Paradigm is

843
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
Just take a hit at

844
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
Somebody on the right and then you're good

845
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
And it doesn't have to be a substantial hit you

846
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
Stuck as a real dick

847
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903

The 70s

851
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
Shoemaker

852
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Might have seen some like

853
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,447
Russian propaganda about ecological efforts

854
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
Okay I don't know I don't know what

855
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
What's going on anymore

856
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Talking about

857
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Propaganda

858
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Before I went to the World's Fair

859
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
Farwest

860
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Ecology

861
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
The worst

862
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Again.

863
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
The Russian

864
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
World's Fair

865
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Through the Russian exhibits

866
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Good morning

867
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Pollutants

868
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Queen

869
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Exactly

870
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
But now we're turning into the

871
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
A system

872
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
Before in the world

873
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,391
What did you just say

874
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
Family

875
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Are the federal

876
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Enemy combatant

877
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Sure

878
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
I think isn't

879
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,295
I pulled it out was because

880
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
This caller is it

881
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,623
Expressing his idea that they saw this Russian.

882
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Display

883
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:53,791
74 worlds

884
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
I wanted things

885
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,375
He brings up his like there's no pollution

886
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
How do you flash forward to the present day in Alex Tucker

887
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:06,591
Think about how coal power plants are all totally clean perfectly

888
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Interesting to see Alex

889
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,431
Becoming this thing that this caller is describing

890
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,831
This horrendous Act of propaganda elected members in 2003

891
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Just

892
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Don't Alex Alex's

893
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Sweetly delusional about

894
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Accepting

895
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
And recognizing and dealing with

896
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
The History of the United States

897
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
He's even worse

898
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,239
Then probably whatever that Soviet Union

899
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Russian

900
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Display was

901
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,103
Yeah that is that is one of those

902
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Things about fashion

903
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
It says that

904
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
What's your in the vinpower

905
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
All of the

906
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
The past is changed to whatever you want

907
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
You know

908
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
If you're as long as

909
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
Trump is running the United States government

910
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
The United States has never ever done anything wrong in saying so is an attempt to undermine Trump

911
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,703
Oh you're going to bring up slavery again the exuberance

912
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Exactly yeah you're screwed up our good time we're trying to slaughter Innocents in your really make

913
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,663
Canis bummed out

914
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,015
So hey we got this idea

915
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
That

916
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Left right

917
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
Same thing

918
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
Last two

919
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Clinton

920
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Bush no

921
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Prince there

922
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Puppets

923
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,511
Sure are they equally respond

924
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
Constable Papas

925

Borscht

926
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
Enjoyed all of it

927
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,271
Beer we got these two presidents who were both Papa

928
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Right

929
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
The Last Samurai

930
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
She would somehow still the one that's on the left

931
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Pinocchio situation

932
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,863
Clinton is when Pinocchio was turned into a donkey for a while

933
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
MW is still the

934
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,215
The puppet but he's not yet a real boy

935
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,383
Sure then Trump is a real book

936
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,479
It's just a remarkable to to look at this and be like Oh yeah this is this

937
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
The active

938
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
The left or the right of the same is so thin

939
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
Almost anytime there's a comparison

940
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Between someone who's on the left

941
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Authorities on the right

942
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
You can see like

943
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
Some sort of derision towards

944
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,007
Is way worse Alia inclusion is what makes

945
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
The bush

946
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
Ee gave a warning

947
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
Sure I'm to the US's

948
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
Supposed enemies

949
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
And

950
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
Text believe that these are actually the global

951
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
And here

952
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
We get another

953
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Wonderful prediction

954
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
So this is one of the problems with

955
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,119
Relying on quote-unquote CSR moments that that sort of thing as being

956
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,423
Addictive of what's going to happen the world

957
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,031
Alright something like we're worried about smallpox cases in American city

958
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,079
And you read that as

959
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
There's going to be

960
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,687
To justify Another War

961
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
You're just making s*** up

962
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
And that's what we see here

963
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
There's

964
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
It's the most powerful

965
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Type of making

966
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
King s*** up proper

967
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,159
Again. We're in somebody trying to

968
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Protect you from a thing that happened

969
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
You have turned into the person trying

970
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
You caused this

971
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Thing that's happening

972
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:14,143
Ensuring that the thing they're worried about almost certainly will happen

973
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,727
And then you get to b**** about how they didn't see it coming

974
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
And then you know

975
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
Do you have these kinds of instances of things

976
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Litter Alex

977
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
His career

978
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
They just things

979
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
Is never happened

980
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,783
Totally talking out of his ass

981
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Of his career

982
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,647
Well the last time I visited Denver there were about four people there after

983
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
To the smallpox epidemic

984
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Destroyed most

985
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
To the city

986
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,767
Sure but they were really cool to hang out

987
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
There's only Lone Survivor

988
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,583
They did try and eat my leg

989
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
Another caller

990
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
This guy's got an interesting I'd

991
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,127
Terrible Alex has to end the conversation by saying

992
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
I don't speculate

993
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
Real estate

994
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
Headlight did I don't know if

995
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Department

996
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Not yet

997
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,815
In the head while back while I was sick find out a little glass

998
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Speedway

999
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Coincidence

1000
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
Little girl

1001
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Kidnapped

1002
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
And just so happy

1003
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
Your last name is

1004
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Smart

1005
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
In fact

1006
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,407
If there's a smart

1007
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
Her parents

1008
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,783
A parent's assigned Amber Alert

1009
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
And

1010
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
Wow

1011
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Wow

1012
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:03,967
Hey listen I'm going to take wild and speculate on that

1013
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
But listen

1014
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,575
I'm going to Rattle off things that are

1015
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
To give Justice

1016
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,159
Application to speculation behind I do not speculate

1017
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
Whether or not the Alyssa

1018
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
Smart kidnapping was an elaborate globalist

1019
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Obviously that plan is

1020
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Play could do it at any point we were told they were going to be silicon chips

1021
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,079
Have Amber exactly

1022
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Fine art

1023
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
Jeff fine

1024
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
Fine

1025
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
I think that's

1026
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:39,039
That's the type of theory if somebody comes at you with you just have to roll up a newspaper and be like no

1027
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Bad

1028
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
I I think that I would love

1029
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
To just like I

1030
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
God

1031
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
My dream job at

1032
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Infowars just

1033
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
Changing

1034
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,839
I want a clip of Alex and I don't

1035
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,935
Speculate speculate

1036
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,055
Stop it it's just a repeat until the speculation

1037
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
So 9/11 was

1038
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
Proven

1039
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,783
By Alex to have been people he can't remember who they are though

1040
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,319
But

1041
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
There's some sign

1042
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Tell tale sign

1043
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,671
How you know

1044
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
That

1045
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
The man was

1046
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Behind door

1047
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,959
911

1048
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,055
000000

1049
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:34,847
What

1050
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Zero's went on

1051
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
9/11 New York Lottery

1052
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
Call 911 one year anniversary

1053
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,287
So I'm not sure I believe this

1054
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,079
Urban legends

1055
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,871
Kind of situation does

1056
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:15,295
According to the CME website does the name of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange when there is no listed as publicly traded

1057
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
CME Group

1058
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
They didn't go public until

1059
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,695
December 5th 2002 when they had their initial public offering

1060
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,511
Stock price

1061
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
Persei me on September 11th 2002 Sunday weather

1062
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,679
That was a real sneaky move by the globalist, I don't know what you

1063
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,727
Referring they really nailed it

1064
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,031
I don't I don't I don't know I

1065
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:41,919
I think you might have seen a meme or something level of b*******

1066
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:46,271
Did you see that George W bush has been complimenting people a lot lately

1067
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
Another word for that is

1068
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,087
Lauding

1069
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,415
He's been doing it repeatedly over time so

1070
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,695
You could say he's

1071
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
Bin

1072
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,023
Laden

1073
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,863
What is that mean we nailed in something

1074
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,447
So people have looked into the lottery thing and that one actually is

1075
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,983
It's true but it doesn't actually mean

1076
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
The state lottery in New York does

1077
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,591
I think they pick to pick

1078
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Three winners

1079
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Each day

1080
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,455
The numbers

1081
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,527
Any 3 digit combination coming up his one and thousand

1082
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:25,183
Because there were two drawings the odds of 911 hitting on any given day are 1 in 500 which really

1083
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:28,767
Interesting coincidence but it's far from proof that the globalist

1084
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Did it to show that they

1085
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
They control lotto numbers

1086
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,935
It's it's fun but you might as well use that as also like

1087
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Oh I had

1088
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:42,079
To call 911 that day it's a miracle yeah it's just weird how much of Alex is supposed

1089
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
Proof of things relies on like June

1090
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
Just denying the

1091
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Yeah well they don't

1092
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
It's a little it's a little annoying

1093
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,319
A real way to argue that

1094
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:57,695
You can be like well the statistical odds of that coming up are not really that insane and

1095
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
Don't know what you're talking about with the Merc

1096
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,327
Alright go off

1097
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,911
How do I I was just talking to this caller and they got into it and argue

1098
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,703
Call her in that someone in

1099
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Their life

1100
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Because

1101
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
Didn't agree on

1102
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
The Federal Reserve

1103
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
Well who can

1104
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
Interesting theory about what

1105
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,687
What's going on there

1106
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
Boring conversation

1107
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,751
Your income tax money go to the ins

1108
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
Federal Reserve

1109
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
I want to show for it

1110
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,231
Pappadeaux

1111
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,071
Don't you

1112
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
Whataburger

1113
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
So I guess you anybody

1114
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
To talk to

1115
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:22,431
I guess anyone argue with an indication that you're right now

1116
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,735
You're wrong just laugh at you

1117
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,807
No it's all God

1118
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,367
Yeah this guy

1119
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,391
He was told

1120
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
By someone

1121
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,719
12 just believe the news

1122
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
That's not what this person

1123
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Responsibilities Sotelo

1124
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,959
So I don't believe that this caller is reporting things accurately that is friend

1125
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Just said

1126
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,055
Watch the news and believe it

1127
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,359
Going to let's let's imagine that that's actually someone's

1128
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:29,503
That is crippling level of naivete and lack of critical thinking that you're approaching

1129
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Information that

1130
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
And I would

1131
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Opposed

1132
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
To what this

1133
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
Yeah supposed person set

1134
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,951
You know what I would even argue that I would be above the left right

1135
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
Paradigm in saying that that is a bad way of

1136
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
Consuming media

1137
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,583
No Alex has

1138
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,607
Couple of options

1139
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
In terms of addressing

1140
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
The situation

1141
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,935
You could say something like that like a

1142
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,031
Your friend should engage more critically with the information like Avenue and you should as well

1143
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:58,943
He could have blanket Defiance I think that would be a better way to go is just as stupid

1144
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:04,063
I think it's just a stupid tumbok the idea of ever listening to the news or be like

1145
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
It's not determinate

1146
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
It's it's not too it's

1147
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,951
It's a pendulum swinging too far the other directions

1148
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,999
Yeah it doesn't matter how you get to

1149
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,839
Consume whatever it is uncritically whether it be

1150
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,375
Eating it or denying

1151
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
Yeah weather in whether it's

1152
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Cnnr WorldNetDaily

1153
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
My girl

1154
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
You want you want

1155
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
He wants

1156
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Them two

1157
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
Except WorldNetDaily uncritically

1158
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,919
And hostility towards

1159
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,759
Things that are saying the outer anybody else

1160
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Nazi

1161
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
Germany there

1162
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Sure

1163
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
It's a bad path

1164
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,415
And I would I would say that he's not setting

1165
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Bring up his list

1166
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,511
It's a strategy that won't get you

1167
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,071
Into a better engagement with information

1168
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
And it'll just make you

1169
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,447
Believe something out loud by something else

1170
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
To your information source

1171
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
Yep and then you'll be like

1172
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
I should give him money because he

1173
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,199
He's saving me from the rest of the evil media and all the sudden start believing that

1174
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Is the messiah

1175
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,087
Actually fighting the literal Den Miami he will believe that

1176
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
Control

1177
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
I'm so Alex

1178
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,671
Is is right about something

1179
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
This

1180
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
In this episode

1181
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
He is right

1182
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
That

1183
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
Stupid

1184
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
The people say that they would die for

1185
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
I think that is

1186
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Call warbler

1187
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,687

1188
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503

Come out

1194
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,791

Yeah also I love how

1196
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,167

01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,287
Threatening my cameraman

1198
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,639
Curse words and he said that he would hurt me physically

1199
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431

Pops into mine

1216
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
That's that

1217
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
Well-practiced

1218
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,831
That's either a mirror or a thing you have said to a lot of people to board

1219
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
Yeah I wish is called as more interesting but I did

1220
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,487
Enjoy that

1221
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279

01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
I don't know if this is Buckley

1224
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,167
I don't think it is

1225
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Sakura bnha

1226
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,239
Yeah it must be another cousin

1227
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Unfortunately

1228
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
All

1229
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Well you'll see

1230
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Okay

1231
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
The Border

1232
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
18 years later

1233
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
Right military isn't all chip

1234
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
AR all

1235
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
But I was right about

1236
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:47,199
Every single military member is

1237
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
Upon

1238
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:53,343
Haha you know those guys the recruiters at your high school

1239
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,159
Every time you shake their hand they are implanting you with

1240
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
Computer to have one of those little assassin's blade exactly

1241
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,863
Get it in there like haha was not a funny joke

1242
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
And then I stare deep into your eyes

1243
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,799
Can program you write write you out of your trance flower on their lapels quirky with water

1244
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,223
That's how you wake up slip on a banana peel walking away from you

1245
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
What is getting chipped

1246
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
Still waiting on this one too

1247
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Come around

1248
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Discolor

1249
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
Has verified our two-story because

1250
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
Because they have also heard

1251
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
That

1252
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,815
The military print out there

1253
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,415
World leader

1254
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:08,863
Yes I see it exactly

1255
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Interactive

1256
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,191
Improvisational storytelling like

1257
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:18,591
I was just coming up with a story for them to get excited about on this day

1258
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,151
Sister scripting this stuff so that's how I can predict

1259
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Naturally

1260
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
Okay

1261
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
Anti chip

1262
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Here's what's interest

1263
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,183
I think I would be opposed to mandatory

1264
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,999
Oh yeah I haven't given it enough

1265
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,791
To really heavy

1266
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
Strong position on it website

1267
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,911
Whatever Direction I would fall on it

1268
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Aspergillus

1269
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
Thought

1270
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
I have a pretty cool hand

1271
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
Yeah I would I would want

1272
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,591
Cupola

1273
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
Assurances up like

1274
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
First Quest

1275
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
Are you going to mind control

1276
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Rack Attack

1277
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:02,111
What else would I ask even if it's nice

1278
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
But I got to look

1279
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,047
Ebony Eyes

1280
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,351
Sure mind control

1281
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
Exactly what I don't mind control

1282
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
Electroshocks no good

1283
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,335
No I think I'd be fine with a little electroshock here in there you know but as long as it's not somebody doing something to doing

1284
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
4weird Ruiz

1285
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,687
I think you're going to have to really litigate what's weird

1286
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:33,087
Well I guess we're going to sit here we're going to talk about it but I'll look him in their evil eyes

1287
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:37,951
Episode can be going over the conditions under which you would approve of Chip

1288
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
Play what all heaven

1289
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Full release

1290
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
Dorkness out

1291
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
For Alex

1292
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
He's supposed to be

1293
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
We totally agree

1294
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,727
Mark of Beast

1295
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,567
Unfortunately he is inconsistent as hell

1296
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,319
What group

1297
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
Wait till but why would

1298
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:15,071
Special Forces getting a few setting a precedent control Special Forces

1299
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,423
But you understand this is silly

1300
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,055
Staunchly opposed to giving microchips to people in the military and molasses

1301
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,127
Green Berets have computer chip

1302
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
I don't understand why

1303
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,807
I don't get what the relevant differences

1304
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
Between people in Special Forces

1305
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
If the argument is that I was just trying to make which is playing

1306
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,047
Is it Savannah become something that goes to

1307
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
The citizenry

1308
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Now

1309
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:54,239
You could just take one step further be like I give it to special forces that normalizes it for the military at Northland for the slippery

1310
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,055
Only work if you start where I save a stop

1311
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,359
It doesn't make sense

1312
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,967
Just cuz we're starting in the middle of the slippery slope meeting that we've already had to go

1313
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,015
From somewhere to get here is pretty dumb

1314
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
So a 2000

1315
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,343
3 with a very different time

1316
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Anti-vax

1317
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Destination community

1318
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,207
No wasn't no I didn't

1319
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
Thanks it wasn't great then either

1320
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,559
So some of these ideas

1321
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
About

1322
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
Autism

1323
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
With vaccination

1324
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,215
And like Mercury the preservatives

1325
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
Less

1326
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
Uniform

1327
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
In the anti-vax

1328
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,639
Community had a lot of the other let's say maybe

1329
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Even

1330
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,967
Stupider ideas shot down

1331
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Right was this

1332
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
Jenny McCarthy was

1333
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
This is

1334
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,855
After she had coming up positive about her timeline

1335
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:46,463
Yeah I don't know that either I'm not sure but I do know that at this point

1336
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
There are

1337
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Anti-vax

1338
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
Proponent

1339
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
Yahoo are making the argument that mercury

1340
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,679
In the preservatives

1341
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Is

1342
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Has a link

1343
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
To auto

1344
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Now

1345
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Point

1346
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Alex

1347
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Doesn't think

1348
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
Alex

1349
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,175
He's trying to steak

1350
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
The Clement something weirder

1351
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,271
Okay

1352
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
Not standby today I don't think

1353
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
Resigned

1354
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,887
Brain development hormones

1355
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:44,575
Alex doesn't say what this hormone is and I'm not sure not going to go on a wild goose chase and then just assume that I found

1356
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,415
Whatever he's talking about we'll talk about it

1357
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Greater depth

1358
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,535
The argument is being put forth to him but there is Mercury

1359
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,607
This is

1360
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,679
That is pretty close to his current position

1361
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
On anti-vax

1362
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Destination

1363
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,055
Safe territory for him now

1364
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
But back then

1365
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,431
He didn't have that he wanted another he wanted his own version

1366
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:15,295
Jump it up wasn't just a Mercury

1367
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,087
It's a naturally occurring elements

1368
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
You can drink gallons of that

1369
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Know what it is

1370
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
Is they grow

1371
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Hormones

1372
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
In labs

1373
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
For brains

1374
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
Incident put in there

1375
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
And that's what does

1376
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
Yeah I think that's interesting I would like to know what he feels about this now that would be still believes there's some weirdo

1377
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,847
Actually behind

1378
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,919
If you'd like to interview some of his weird

1379
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,455
Text friends about that

1380
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,759
Interesting place nearby that nonsense

1381
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,855
Get the caller this was this made me so happy

1382
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
God dammit

1383
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
Make me happy

1384
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:58,815
Young man household was arranged this caller is the same person who

1385
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,375
You called and Alex argue with him about the Republic

1386
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
Look up Texas

1387
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
Alex

1388
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,519
Is clearly annoyed with this guy really

1389
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,799
Get a bike

1390
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,079
He doesn't become a

1391
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
Clear

1392
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,919
Did Alex knows who he's talking to until the end of this collab

1393
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Atlanta weather

1394
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,991
This is great this is just so good

1395
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
Later on

1396
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,807
Crap goes down

1397
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,415
Will meet these people on our side

1398
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,999
Took this real quick as a as an introduction this caller has said that he

1399
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,535
He took one of Alex's films

1400
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
Do the Aspen Sheriff

1401
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,375
Department any woke up the sheriff

1402
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Okay and everybody on the

1403
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
Before Center like now

1404
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,239
It really does sound like it

1405
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Doesn't it

1406
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:46,175
Feels like that's how they get

1407
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,223
Good2Go

1408
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Beginning of this called

1409
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,415
Constitutionalist

1410
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,231
The New World Order

1411
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,119
Hardly agree with you

1412
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,615
Republican

1413
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
The Rocky Mountains

1414
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
Colorado

1415
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,415
Robbie chronic Colorado

1416
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Okay Alec

1417
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
He did

1418
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:41,471
I like the red that's going through these episodes that I'm getting to a driver Alex's

1419
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,751
Pissed off by Republic of Tea

1420
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,287
Texas people

1421
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
It is nice

1422
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
I do appreciate that

1423
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
Because he has this whole thing is like

1424
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
Texas has its own country

1425
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,711
Secede

1426
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,527
What is a country and it involves

1427
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,391
A bunch of place to the north we got most New Mexico

1428
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Colorado

1429
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:05,279
I don't appreciate how that Community is still allowed to have

1430
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,815
People that are too far out there

1431
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Y'all are crazy

1432
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
Don't don't

1433
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,655
Judge them for being like

1434
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,471
And also the Northwest Territory is ours to

1435
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
You are mad because

1436
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Your ideas look

1437
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,567
Just as ridiculous

1438
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,359
This is theirs and theirs make you

1439
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Feel

1440
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,199
Yeah yeah they think that is a part of it

1441
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,015
Something that I really enjoy

1442
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,807
Alex's ability to sort of play with

1443
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
The guy

1444
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Back. That's true

1445
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,719
Alex could not do that now

1446
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
Texas or Aspen Colorado

1447
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,583
Doubling down on Micah hey man

1448
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
I just

1449
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,191
Just go ahead and say exactly what you and I both know you're about

1450
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,031
To say I recognize your voice

1451
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:54,431
I'm going to ask you this question

1452
01:13:54,687 --> 01:14:00,831
Aspen as I know I've heard name of Aspen before is that a city in Colorado

1453
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
Texas

1454
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
So we get another caller

1455
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,231
And this fella is really

1456
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Lauding

1457
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
Alex and Kim

1458
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,351
About opposition

1459
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
Into the Patriot Act

1460
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,215
And so there is a there been some places

1461
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
That have passed resolution

1462
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
In some cities

1463
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
City councils and what-have-you

1464
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,127
If you listen closely to this clip though

1465
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,711
Color is congratulating Alex for doing something that he

1466
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
He himself

1467
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,039
Is literally saying was done

1468
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
Buy communist

1469
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:38,463
Democratic primary sponsor

1470
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,583
EPA were talking about rushing waters

1471
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,631
Standard would think it was a city

1472
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:11,999
Call me a city government to support the Constitution of United States

1473
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
Goodnight cute

1474
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
You calling these people

1475
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:23,007
Who wrote the Revolutions in the communist government

1476
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
Pastor

1477
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,079
But somehow Alex is responsible for this

1478
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
It's outrageous

1479
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
This is

1480
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
This is kind of amazing

1481
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,455
That's that's

1482
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,479
You know what

1483
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
I get it

1484
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,063
Every time something good

1485
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
Because of the

1486
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
Left ideas but you can't

1487
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,999
Allow the work that's done by actual activists

1488
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
Primarily on the left

1489
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,839
It's sometimes yelled about

1490
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
And taking credit for by people who yell

1491
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Like Alex

1492
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
I mean like that's all he does

1493
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,751
You just yelled something because

1494
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,079
Popular

1495
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:03,711
Oh man is social security Medicare we can't let that stuff out of naturally

1496
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:07,295
When it was being passed we would have called it a communist

1497
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,391
Landgraabs trying to kill us all and steal our money but now that it

1498
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,231
Has no we have it in the worst wow it's our favorite program

1499
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
If there is a phenomenon

1500
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,119
The end of this episode gets a little bit into his own head

1501
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
And

1502
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
Is

1503
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
Talk in a bit about how like

1504
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
People asking why he's not dead

1505
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Shoreline the globalist

1506
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
Sure I would have you

1507
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,639
You talked about being ready to die

1508
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
For freedom

1509
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,535
It's remarkable how that's almost

1510
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,327
Exactly mirrored by

1511
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,631
If someone had a gun to my head and told me to denounce

1512
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
What's trumps

1513
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
I'd say pull the trigger

1514
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Freedom

1515
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
God

1516
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Family

1517
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,847
Hellboy

1518
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Kind of depressing

1519
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
Super depressed

1520
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,687
31 Westcliff Jordan

1521
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
And it was clip

1522
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
Alex is in a bit of a rant

1523
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
About

1524
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,551
Being alive

1525
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,319
Right

1526
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
He had felt

1527
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,951
Suppose that I will accept that as a

1528
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
This is getting a little bit

1529
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,815
Bit closer to that territory of

1530
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,351
Religiosity

1531
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
That we might be

1532
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
Keeping her finger on the pulse

1533
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Okay

1534
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
I'm sorry

1535
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,103
Can your heart

1536
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,159
There is not even a question

1537
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,023
When you go this player

1538
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,071
New World Order

1539
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,151
Things that I always loved the idea that to Alex

1540
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:18,527
Like I no longer feel human emotion I no longer drawing

1541
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,343
The bad witch other Mortal man now

1542
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,159
Because the fight won the globalist is so strong in the New World Order

1543
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,695
I found

1544
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,023
That clip to be really on the line

1545
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,559
Argument

1546
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,863
You can still be made that a lot of that is

1547
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
You know it's

1548
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Kind of

1549
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Christian is

1550
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,775
Yeah I know God's in your heart is on the 700 Club

1551
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,567
Sure that doesn't that's not as a

1552
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,103
Stream is certainly a lot of

1553
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
Sure Maurice

1554
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,223
Sunday is right when he says that you're up against Pure Evil

1555
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,343
I could still be metaphorical flourish or as opposed to what we know he believes now which is

1556
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,647
Literal demons invading people

1557
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,439
Yeah yeah that is true

1558
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,511
I do I do think that should come out

1559
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,583
Much sooner in a conversation and should be something that you have

1560
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,607
Have to leave it like if

1561
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,399
If you're doing Alex's show

1562
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
You should have to lead with like

1563
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:13,311
I believe that our political enemies are literally controlled by the devil like everyday

1564
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,640
Yeah just like if when I meet somebody there like

1565
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
You should have to

1566
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
To tell me if you believe this

1567
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,504
The biblical flood story is 100% true

1568
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,064
Okay fine then you don't get an opinion on back

1569
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,344
You don't like it

1570
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Get it out of the way

1571
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,672
So we can move forward I don't

1572
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,208
Need to know anything else about you

1573
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,280
How do you say I think it's more like a situation where

1574
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
If

1575
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,840
If you're going to like

1576
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Let's say

1577
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,144
Start dating somebody

1578
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,472
Or whatever and they don't tell you that they think the Earth is flat

1579
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
So where are you at

1580
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,080
Irresponsible

1581
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,104
I think that Alex

1582
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,640
As a person who's conveying in

1583
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
Information

1584
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:54,272
I think it is it is relevant if you believe that the devil is behind the

1585
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,808
Gears of your enemies

1586
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
I think you should be

1587
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,392
Upfront because it gives people the ability

1588
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
E2

1589
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:05,536
Consider that in the totality of the information you're presented more seriously

1590
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,816
I honestly

1591
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Quite tell you

1592
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
Yeah

1593
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
No I agree

1594
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
There's more indications than I was expecting

1595
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,592
Yeah it's probably not coincidental that like this

1596
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,432
God is real God is there right isn't he

1597
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,320
I think that he would leave the episode with it

1598
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
The stalwarts

1599
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Skateboard

1600
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:33,952
For him if you have a disclaimer for like a video game

1601
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
Trailer that's like

1602
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,792
Some scenes are not actual gameplay

1603
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,608
You should at least have to have a disclaimer for like

1604
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,448
Also believes that the devil is real you know like that should be there

1605
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,520
Bumper is coming in from break or like

1606
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:51,104
You know like do you want to fight corruption well soon as he's like

1607
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
That's not what this is about

1608
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,992
Do you believe that you're a crusader against the literal Christian

1609
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
Devil

1610
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,856
That's a good show okay okay alright well then now we get it

1611
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:05,184
Do you think the demons jump into people and make them go black

1612
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,512
Yes I do sir I will listen Otis app

1613
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
There we go

1614
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,816
Yeah

1615
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
It's an interesting

1616
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Interesting

1617
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Progression

1618
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,520
And I'm fascinated by this and so much more

1619
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Cinebowl

1620
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
In the past like a totally

1621
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
Totally

1622
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
Absolutely callers are weirdos in a fun way

1623
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,904
Is not a show that is just a man unraveling really fun and creates comedic tension in

1624
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Mike Fraser

1625
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,256
Is that some of the colors are annoying today

1626
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:44,608
I know what you're going to get

1627
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,400
Yes

1628
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
Keep solenoid that's so funny

1629
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,008
It did yeah enjoy that

1630
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
Adele

1631
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:55,104
I hope every episode I listen to you gets into a fight

1632
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
With somebody who believes

1633
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,176
Just slightly the wrong

1634
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Yeah

1635
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
Man it's so ridiculous

1636
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
That you think that the Magna

1637
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Carter is still the law of the land

1638
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,160
Unless you're in capital letters and it's

1639
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
It's Corporation

1640
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
Spell obviously

1641
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,536
The literal Christian devil is sending demons into

1642
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,560
People's brains

1643
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,840
To control their Acts

1644
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Sure

1645
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Anyway

01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,264
