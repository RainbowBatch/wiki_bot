1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
College fight. Com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
Geraldine we are Dan

6
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Dion Jordan your dulcet tones are incredible however I must ask you do you do any

7
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,544
Impressions or voices

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616
No you never have to write

9
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,736
What do you mean why would anybody be like some different sound

10
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
No I don't

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,088
Believe that was ever part of my

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Comedic rapper

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,488
Why are you never you never even goes further than that like

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,864
I handle mine

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
This is the opposite of

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Know when I

17
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
I took languages

18
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
School like

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
I get to French

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Greek

21
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
And like

22
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Whenever I would try and speak those languages

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,808
You know to be like a book

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Doing it acts like you do it exalts

25
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Or that that

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
The feeling of like

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
I have to dress up my French sounding like a Pepe Le Pew

28
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
Yeah it always has been

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Versed

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
I got to do a good Alex

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
It's probably really want a guy you've never tried

32
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,136
Give me give me a

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Does Christopher Walken right

34
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
No I don't want to do that

35
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
So I don't know a lot about oppression

36
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
Jordan but I do know a lot about Alex Jones and I don't know much about

37
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
Give me a nickel

38
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Man now I can

39
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Wow

40
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
It's not good I don't do any Impressions either

41
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,880
Anyway today

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
I think a lot of people probably thought that

43
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
You know Trump got impeached

44
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
Attractive last week a lot of people would think

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,936
Well because true a lot of people might have assumed

46
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,008
Hey these guys are going to rush out a Friday episode

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
And one of the reasons for that was I felt like if we

48
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
Do we have to record it on Thursday

49
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
That means we could only have Thursday

50
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Show to respond

51
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Where is if we waited till Monday

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
Thursday and Friday so today we have December 9th

53
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
The 20th

54
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
From

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
The end of last week

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
And you know it's a it's a silly thing

57
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
This episode quite silly

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,376
Quite upsetting of course I imagine it either goes he talks nothing

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Nothing but impeachment or he doesn't even mention it

60
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Throughout the show was worthwhile to rush out some episode

61
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
I think pretty much everybody

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
He knows what his take on it

63
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
That is it route

64
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Damn globalist

65
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,928
And keeping prepping his audience for it already like he's been saying that the house is going to vote to impeach so like

66
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
He has no reason

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,303
Freak out or anything I didn't expect any firework I didn't get the

68
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
But there is some really messed up

69
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Stuff stuff that goes on

70
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Particularly on tonight

71
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
And then also some fun

72
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
We need to steal all the House of Representatives shoes would be a more reasonable thing then

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Take a moment

74
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
People who have signed up for

75
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039

You're listening out there to thicken had your the showed liked these Jets

95
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Complicated

96
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
For sure we would have

97
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
It would be lovely

98
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
So

99
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
We are on the 19th

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Trump been impeached

101
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Alex's

102
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
I have a lot of feelings about it

103
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,415
Got to do a little bit of out of context okay

104
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Alzheimer's

105
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,839
Just a good out of contacts.

106
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
I love that

107
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
So inspiring

108
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Did they keep good

109
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
You're at

110
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Okay

111
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
So enthused

112
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Listen

113
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
So we started the 19th

114
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
And we hear a very familiar thing

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
From Alex

116
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
And that is today is the most important show I have ever done

117
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,751
Now I've been on the year 25 years and as the years go on I've said many times this is one of the most important broadcast we ever done

118
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
I used to say it once a year

119
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,663
But I might say every six months because there's a quickening things are getting more serious more crazy

120
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,015
The human animal cloning the open devil worship the open pedophilia

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
They're going to be your old one

122
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Play open destruction of the family

123
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
The open 5G

124
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Fluoridation

125
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
The spiked vaccines

126
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
Trojan Horse takedown of humanity

127
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Get drunk

128
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
But this broadcast

129
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Up to this point

130
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
The most important broadcast

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
I will ever do

132
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
Until I'm not someone to get butterflies or chill cop

133
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
But I am

134
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Sweating

135
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Right now and it's cold

136
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
It's cool

137
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
So we got a situation where I mean

138
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Cousin Alex thing

139
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,935
Know that I do say that this is the most boring show ever a lot but this time

140
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,823
It actually I used to say it in frequently and now it's because of the news I'm sure

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
Because of the news that I'm saying it every couple of weeks now myself into a corner where everything is

142
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
F****** Extreme as hell

143
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Guys

144
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
He's coming down fast

145
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
So today is the most important show ever

146
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
And part of that is

147
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,119
Sure you'd expect that to be your most important show ever

148
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Theory about what's going to

149
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
To happen is going to play out over the course of

150
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Episode

151
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
Find a convoluted

152
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Here is where Alex

153
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
These are the traitors easily sellouts he's the enemies of the Republic

154
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
And so there is a program

155
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
There is an operation there is a plan

156
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Remove

157
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
The president

158
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Within

159
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
The show trial

160
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
That the house is already had

161
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Prodigy

162
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Using that as a

163
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Platform in the media as a show trial

164
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
The spring a bunch of other scandals which they're starting

165
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
To announce

166
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Supreme Court members

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Like the Chief Justice

168
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,975
The move in and say the Senate has not been impartial

169
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Supreme Court make a right at the president

170
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
In a true judicial to really this is openly

171
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
By not long for this world against Berg

172
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,639
Coming up the ultimate cliffhanger

173
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,271
So I mean we still have these themes of like everybody's being blackmailed should now apparently

174
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Chief justice

175
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Roberts is

176
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,695
Being blackmailed or something

177
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
Talking about this plan sounds like her what a cliffhanger that sounds like her

178
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
A lot of sense but he'll get more indeed

179
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Sterilize things

180
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Go along

181
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Here's a think there is a play

182
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
Obviously

183
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Well but he's only giving you the broad Strokes

184
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Alright okay so there are more moving parts

185
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,671
Do you want to have a lot of moving part you want this to be ocean 7,000

186
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,559
What is a many conspirators as possible yeah that's how you get things

187
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
McDonald's

188
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Secretly

189
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
But look dude

190
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Plan and Alex is telling you that the

191
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,847
And everybody's being blackmailed although he's not proven that in any meaningful way at all

192
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
But you don't

193
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Need to

194
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Blindly Trust

195
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Alex

196
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
His track record

197
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
He's been right about Soma

198
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
Everything we covered here is incredibly important

199
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Appetite

200
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Footage of Epstein's

201
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
Suicide and the previous attempts suicide but I tried to kill him

202
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
That wasn't hard to deduce

203
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
They murdered him in cold blood inside there

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Now turns out

205
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
But the videos Gone Missing

206
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
As we told you before

207
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,527
So a lot of these deductions are easy

208
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
So it was reported in the New York daily news on the

209
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,207
Tea that footage from Jeffrey Epstein's initial suicide attempt that Alex doesn't believe his real had gone

210
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,839
Sure that story was based on comments by assistant us attorney Jason swergold who said that

211
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Quote it is our understanding that the video no longer exists

212
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
It was not preserve

213
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
In the initial article on the 18th

214
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
It was reported that the government was asked

215
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
2 quotes

216
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Further into what happened to the footage

217
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,991
I need it because on December 19th to do New York Daily News posted an article with the headline quote

218
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,087
Missing surveillance footage of Jeffrey Epstein suicide attempt has been found

219
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
That new article included this quote

220
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,767
Earlier today the government confirmed with MCC staff but the video was preserved by MC

221
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
CC staff upon defense counsel's request

222
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Who was that quote from

223
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
You guessed it

224
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
Us Assistant Attorney Jason swergold

225
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,103
Naturally the most simple explanation for this whole situation is irresponsible reporting based on irresponsible comments from Anna

226
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Assistant us attorney

227
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,503
He spoke kind of out-of-turn made comments that were taken as gospel then learnt pretty quickly that he was

228
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Correct in that assumption

229
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
The New York daily news turns around a post

230
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
The story that the missing footage

231
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Even kind of b*******

232
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,023
Because based on these stories I'm not certain that footage was ever missing in the first place

233
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,679
It all doesn't matter because now the fact that a day later they were attracted the footage that the footage was missing will be used as proof

234
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
The footage

235
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,823
Globalist shutdown swergold would lie to the New York daily news or so

236
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Alex didn't predict anything

237
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Just foolish

238
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Do they not know that reporting

239
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
That the footage has gone missing

240
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
Is going to be far more popular

241
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Then the second day when they report that it's

242
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
The damage will be done

243
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
Bye

244
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
Call it damage

245
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Call impression whatever

246
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
You will concretely put this into

247
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
People's butt

248
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
And if you're not going

249
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
Undo with a correct exactly

250
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Printing

251
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Is the deal

252
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
I don't know what the right answer

253
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
Because if that footage is actually missing

254
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Then that's a story that you should report

255
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
But

256
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Someone

257
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Asserting that it's missing

258
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Baby hold on to that story until you do a little bit more digging on

259
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,071
Well I mean your recycle bin on

260
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
What

261
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,727
Windows automatically deletes after 30 days it was only a couple of days after that I'm sure they just

262
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Just restored the file

263
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Yeah I don't know what the right answer is but I know that it's not

264
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
That's because Alex buy this

265
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
It's the 19th

266
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,271
He has every reason to have the access to the new New York Daily News

267
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Correct

268
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Situation

269
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,415
Because the narrative is much better with the

270
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Erroneous

271
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
I don't know what

272
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
You should do if your the New York daily news and

273
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Then I wouldn't

274
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
I guess what I would say is

275
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Write the story as

276
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
It's just

277
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
This guy

278
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
Saying yeah yeah

279
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
I'm at well I mean

280
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
It is one of those things where it's like

281
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
That is an incredible scoop if the New York daily news got that actual information and they're the first to go public with it

282
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
That you just going to be a big deal

283
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
But also it tends to be a situation where

284
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
Holyshit this is huge news is too good to be true

285
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
All too often

286
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
With with conspiracy theories

287
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Yeah you got to be careful

288
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Cuz it matters

289
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Oh yeah

290
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
So Alex is a big announcement

291
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
That is related to

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
To this whole impeached

293
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
He's really

294
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Typing this out

295
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Let me make the big announcement here

296
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,063
Sirens going on in the background I could have drum rolls I could

297
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
My hair on fire

298
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Cool

299
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,023
Cut my finger off on are we get your attention to really listen to me I do it

300
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
I believe you

301
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,655
I don't

302
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
I love you my life right now

303
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Pusher

304
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
The price to pay at by the way I'm not suicidal one Olivia 150 and

305
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Love God

306
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,575
My point is I'm going to get my wife to beat these people because that's what it's all about

307
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
And your life is just

308
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
Experience but I'm done talking about that

309
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
This is most important broadcast I've ever done

310
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
And you can have a thought with thousands

311
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Amazed

312
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Cedar Point's

313
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Hundreds of thousands of sub points in data

314
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
And knowledge and background understanding

315
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
It all come together with certainty

316
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
And when you have that certain day

317
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
And you see it time and time again

318
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
Come true exactly as you envision

319
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
That's called

320
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Beyond wisdom

321
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
It's called discernment

322
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
Call site

323
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
The Second Sight

324
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,519
But 99% of it is actually the incredible lectro chemical brain

325
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Supercomputer

326
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Integrating all those data points but that

327
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Little 1% of spirit

328
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
The electrochemical

329
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Internet

330
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Takes you across to the pressure

331
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
So what I'm going to do this is Shelby

332
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,951
If I'm just going to stop for this segment kind of mention some of the other news

333
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,047
And then when I come back in the next segment I'm going to come in it with precision

334
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,655
I have a gigantic story I'm going to ramble about nothing

335
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
The amazing electrochemical brain

336
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
What the

337
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
I also think if you listen

338
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
I think Alex is describing being

339
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Confused

340
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
Who sang you got that you got a hundred different datapoints things I think he's talking about the difference between

341
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
Actually being confused and presenting it as certain

342
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
Whatever the case is it solve this

343
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Like the beginning of this episode is all this like

344
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
I got this big news

345
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Either next segment

346
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Because I got to do it right

347
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Catahoula good

348
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Got to do a good job

349
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
That's that's so funny that

350
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Like I just imagine going back

351
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
And seeing

352
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
Jesus giving The Sermon on the Mount but he's like okay first hour we're just going to do a couple little things I'm going to rip for a while

353
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
The big stuff is going to get you some big stuff after

354
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
It is next hour

355
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
Predator now

356
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
I really got to just rip this out

357
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,231
American historical figures

358
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Yeah it seems like there's a message

359
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Get it out but

360
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Lyrics to some news

361
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Like the other he said he's going to get

362
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Somebody's other heads

363
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Lionshare

364
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
And one of them I found deeply upset

365
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Pearl Harbor

366
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:32,063
3000 people killed in a bunch of battleships sunk it was terrible and it was horrible

367
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
But frankly Churchill was working with

368
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,207
Roosevelt and I got the purple and blue coat completely and new

369
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Even the day of the attack and ordered the carriers out to sea

370
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
So they wouldn't be shocked until the old obsolete battleships

371
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
No good for Pacific Warfare would be destroyed

372
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
Really a chakra 5-3000

373
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
There are any warmers your pan for 2 years in China

374
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,919
What bloody Howard hunt were there sniping people daily

375
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Add

376
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,759
That's how you win Wars I'm not defend

377
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
What

378
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
But it was a Gamble

379
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Would you sacrifice a pawn

380
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
In chats to lower your opponent out to win the entire

381
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
That's all Declassified

382
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
As not to classify

383
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
But the way he's describing Pearl Harbor there is

384
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Exactly how he

385
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
You would think that's not what he thinks about 9/11

386
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
No because that a false flag right

387
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
It's weird I don't understand what do you mean

388
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Okay but firstly not to split hairs but

389
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
2335 Americans died in

390
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Attack on Pearl Harbor and 64 Japanese

391
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
I know Alex just being in vague terms but he's off by like 30

392
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Kind of a big deal

393
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Yeah

394
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
That's the bigger issue

395
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
And that is Alex believes

396
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,239
Attack on Pearl Harbor was a false flag for some reason

397
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
Since you splitting hairs and saying it's not a false flag because the Japanese did it right okay whatever I have no idea what his

398
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Uses for Eddie

399
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,295
Everything are because I've definitely heard him say that Pearl Harbor was a false flag in the past

400
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
So the stuff you saying you're is not

401
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
There have not been Declassified documents proving that there was a stand down or even that the US had specific prior knowledge of the Japanese

402
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Attack

403
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
I wasn't even playing fast and loose with decrypt

404
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Because he's not specifying which Japanese

405
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
Coach me practice

406
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Up till that point

407
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
Using the purple code

408
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
No that's largely true but yeah

409
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
Like those are some of the codes

410
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Did we agree

411
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
But that doesn't mean that we have the ability to

412
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Decipher the relevant messages

413
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,831
Regarding the attack once you decipher one code you decipher all codes and that's just like how if you learn

414
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Greek you know all of their life

415
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,231
It makes sense 10 separate inquiries have been done to examine this claim

416
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Before knowledge

417
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
And none support the theory that Alex is put in

418
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
The only real evidence I can find of truth behind the code-breaking stuff is it there was a coded message that we translated which was

419
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Is intercepted the day before the

420
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
The message indicated the

421
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Japan intended to break off negotiations

422
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Informal relations

423
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
United States

424
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Next day

425
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
That was interpreted by most as being indicative

426
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
The Japanese did intend to attack someone

427
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
But the military at the time it's been expecting them to invade Thailand

428
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Or somewhere else

429
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
The Pacific

430
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
That would effectively break off negotiations

431
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
That was the kind of the interpretation to mess

432
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Had the time

433
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
It wasn't that they were going to bomb Pearl Harbor

434
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
Sister gigantic leap to make

435
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
But it sort of gigantic logical leap Alex

436
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Be accustomed

437
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,384
So most of what Alex is saying is 100% based on a book or pamphlet

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Put out a 19

439
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
244 called the

440
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
By Pearl Harbor

441
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Written by a guy named John

442
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Slim

443
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
When was an extreme right-wing figure in the 40s

444
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,184
It was instrumental in the organizing of the America first come

445
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,328
You may remember that music group who are deeply anti-semitic and profashion but pretended that they were just

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
The intervention it I wouldn't call him rabbit

447
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
When was a bit of a propaganda for the America First Commission

448
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Being involved in creating a

449
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Advertisement

450
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
Not to sway public opinion away from getting involved in the European

451
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Korean War

452
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,432
KFC dissolve right after Pearl Harbor

453
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,272
Do you have to join the war which made the whole don't join the war Arc

454
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
A little harder

455
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Even though they've been unsuccessful in keep

456
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,696
Us out of the war the members of the AFC didn't just give up

457
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
And one of the prongs are there further work was to create the narrative

458
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,352
The only reason the US got into the war in the first place was because of it

459
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Conspiracy

460
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,008
If it hadn't been for the meddling communist and evil forces within our own government that attack on Pearl Harbor

461
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Wouldn't have happened

462
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
And then we wouldn't have gotten into

463
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Horse whinny

464
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Do you think about it

465
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Axis powers are really the victim

466
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,504
Yeah absolutely weird

467
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
The other angle here is that the folks on the extreme right like John

468
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
I hated Str because of his social

469
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
Myriad other reasons and Roosevelt was running for re-election in 19

470
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
44

471
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
So this book was released as a large-scale attempted

472
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
We are going to derail his campaign

473
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
With accusations that he knew in advance with

474
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
This attack was coming

475
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
But he let it happen so you could go to war

476
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:15,456
Alex is just repeating s*** some dumb fascist wrote about 80 years ago to try and stop after yards re-election

477
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
He's pretending it's Declassified and totally real

478
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
The sad

479
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
The sad stuff

480
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
It's wild to me how you can claim to be in

481
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Find WWII of all things

482
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
One of these

483
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Most

484
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,144
Exhaustively researched events in human history

485
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,288
I can't think of anything that has been more exhausted cover-up would have to be

486
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Owens dhanasekar

487
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
It would include

488
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
The entire world leader

489
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
Which I suppose is the only thing that makes sense

490
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:56,416
His for him graduate student right

491
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Bellows

492
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Yeah

493
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Any wife

494
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,168
I just think that's kind of interesting and I think it is one of these really

495
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Things that you find

496
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
That is

497
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Would you trace back a lot of

498
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
Dumb conspiracy theory yeah what you end up finding is

499
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
People who were used

500
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
For political reasons initially

501
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,296
They may or may not have served their political purpose at the time

502
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
And then

503
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
They Echo throughout

504
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
People

505
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
Baby unintentionally

506
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Picnic on a life

507
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,048
I'm past the original use of the thing it said it was being used

508
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Or in this case primarily

509
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
To attack FDR's relax

510
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,520
I mean in some ways that is that is very similar to Alex immediately following the boss

511
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Embalming where it's like

512
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
The cement hasn't dried

513
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,736
So while I'm there I can make up whatever story I want you imprinted going to be left in the sand

514
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeah if that was an election

515
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
You're abusing more

516
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:01,696
Yeah cuz it is just politically-motivated it is to attack Obama

517
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:07,072
The globalist who are the Democrats

518
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
In that I think that's attacked

519
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,240
Standard operating commercial

520
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
There is two are

521
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
Mostly a political and what they are

522
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,200
Gunning for right or what they believe that they're involved

523
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
They takes.

524
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
But I think there's a lot more of

525
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
That is that is like

526
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Alex

527
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Yeah

528
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
So

529
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
Alex just gets rambling

530
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
I know you said he was going to talk talk

531
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
Get some news out of the way really

532
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,936
And you know he doesn't

533
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Fake Jefferson quote

534
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
On the show

535
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
It was interesting on this that in this instance

536
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
You decides to swing

537
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Further for the fences

538
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
Dig deep into the past okay

539
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Cicero

540
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Senator

541
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
Outside with open banners we can defeat

542
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,488
The city of stronger enemy that mobilizes

543
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
But traitors Within

544
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Traitors within the Republic

545
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Are the plague and can bring it down

546
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
And as it was 2000

547
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
67 years ago and he said that

548
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
My memory serves

549
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
It doesn't

550
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
It is today

551
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
That's not a real Cicero quote

552
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
I just accepted it is true but

553
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,000
Called a pillar of iron written by Taylor Caldwell in 19 6

554
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
55

555
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
Caldwell's Basin the book on a lot of real sources about

556
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,728
But the quotes that are passed around about Traders being the carriers of the plague we're all Caldwell's creation

557
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,592
Historically the far-right is use this quote to push back against greater social equality

558
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Which is not surprised

559
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Nor is it surprising that I was once again has no idea what he's talking about

560
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Exploding things

561
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Using just to make him

562
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Cancel soundsmart

563
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,416
And you can hear that to even like 2067 years if my memory

564
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
That's just trying to be fancy

565
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,072
No that's totally that's totally

566
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
What is Ayo

567
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
The guy who named Mount Everest

568
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,752
The original like height is changed now

569
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,800
But he measured it at

570
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
25000 ft exact

571
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
And he was like

572
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,480
No one is going to f****** believe that it exactly 25000 feet

573
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
So he just told people as 25,000

574
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
M to feet

575
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
So I can look at how good I am at measuring thing

576
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,416
I got it all the way down to 2 ft

577
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
I understand that impulse

578
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
It's more for me it's more like Alex rattling off the name

579
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Name of that subset

580
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,376
Thanks Bruce

581
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,728
That that's my way of impressing you into thick 9090 what I talk about

582
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
2000

583
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
767

584
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,920
Upgrade my brain is 67 of your math.

585
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
When you are 19 years old and your first year of college

586
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Yeah exactly

587
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
It's like you're not going to question me if I know all of that

588
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
I have an eidetic memory for one thing I will question

589
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
You read that to me

590
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Anyway Alex

591
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Has been trying to

592
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
He's going to get to the next segment

593
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Time to get down

594
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Let's enjoy right now

595
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
Best I can

596
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
And then I'd end up in the phones up throughout

597
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,944
The second third and into the fourth hour and Matt bracken's biases

598
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
The next one job last night

599
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
Covering more than folding until late in the evening

600
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
And

601
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,120
Hear a little about to break down but then I

602
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,216
Also have all the different ways and different Avenues and different paths

603
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
That we can break down

604
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
How they're intending to make this move because

605
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
They do intend on removing

606
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
President

607
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah they impeach him

608
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
That's

609
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah that is

610
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Mariah

611
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
What would they be doing not

612
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
Trying to see if they don't intend to remove him what are we doing here

613
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
What do you think we're doing

614
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
If we're not in pain again all I hear Alex saying there is I'm

615
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
I don't know how to play this this is not

616
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
You really think this was going to happen

617
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Or or whatever you know like

618
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,712
I have all the evidence but I don't know what the

619
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Angles

620
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Much true

621
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,880
Just do your job and say your s***

622
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
So Alex

623
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
But it's going to get down to business

624
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Bottom line is they playing

625
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Strop

626
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
We have a plan to remove him

627
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
What's the address

628
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
Is the process

629
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
They're going to double down though

630
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
And it all in

631
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
They do intend on removing

632
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
President-trump

633
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
And we can say all well it's blowing up in their face looking phone numbers

634
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
And I got plan

635
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
And so

636
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
It is

637
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
Bending towards failing spectacularly

638
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
You understand all they do is keep doubling down

639
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,872
Look at what a double down at this level does when it's an open public

640
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
Kangaroo court

641
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Railroading

642
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
But what comes after that

643
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
Two kangaroos

644
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Is that rhetorical

645
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,096
Okay thanks I just don't want to be like I've been for 25 years

646
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Laying out very important things constantly

647
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Gibbering as fast as I can talk

648
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
Trying to get out all the little factoids

649
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Miss the forest for the trees

650
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
Aren't you part of the 732 do it I promise

651
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Okay so we're going to do it next Sigma

652
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
This is

653
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
You know what I hear I hear temperature

654
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,632
Yeah I hear just somebody who's is like

655
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Like my f****** dude the guy who I changed my

656
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
Walking career for ice

657
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Took a

658
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
So many hits

659
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
Trying to go down this road because I thought it was going to go summaries

660
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Going to kick all the

661
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
Mexicans out of the country I thought this was going to work out we were getting install a patriot dictator

662
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
How's the plant

663
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
The third president history to ever be impeached

664
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
God God what the

665
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,536
The fuk I just hate this level of

666
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
Set news like it's November 1963 there's some pretty big news about the president we're going to talk

667
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Talk about this in the next

668
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
Like yeah

669
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
Yeah it's that big a deal you just

670
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152
Say it right away you would think yeah you wouldn't think you have to wait until like

671
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
I just I don't

672
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
I am the segment

673
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,296
I need to apportion 2 minutes to plug so I

674
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,904
Can't get to this everybody remembers where they were an hour after Kennedy

675
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
You know you might remember to do the Kennedy died but you definitely remember the brain

676
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
4 Savage

677
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
Kennedy died

678
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah yeah yeah

679
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Alex's got to be

680
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Kind of feeling in a f*****-up place

681
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Because

682
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
As much as he can make the argument now like

683
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,456
Sandy Hook is not who I am

684
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,296
Will not Define my Google what I remember.

685
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,904
A little difficult to disentangle your your legacy

686
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
From Thompson

687
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
What should

688
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
No matter what

689
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Ends up happening

690
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Trump is in the history books as

691
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Is the third president

692
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
To ever be impeached

693
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,960
And so Alex is the champion in the mouth

694
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Piece of

695
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Cider press

696
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,824
That's part of his history to now

697
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
And if it doesn't work out well

698
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Not a ton of invocation to come

699
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,808
He's he's the type of guy who

700
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:34,208
So far has done nothing but gradually put larger and larger necklaces made of rocks out of a snake

701
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
To like a hobby

702
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
If you were to fall into the into the river he would

703
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
Don't go to Barton Springs

704
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,264
Yeah exactly what's the matter hot spring are not going to save you

705
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
So Alex comes back from break

706
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Time to get in

707
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,432
They want to establish and private corporate world

708
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
And they're very

709
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Very

710
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Upset

711
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
They're very

712
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Very

713
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Upset

714
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
That

715
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Humanity

716
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Is not

717
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Going

718
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Along with

719
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
And so they are going to try

720
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
What they've done in the past what other empires have done

721
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
To get the little people the average people fighting with each other

722
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,744
If you don't pick it up you're going to run out of time in this segment to like quite frankly this staccato

723
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
His got to stop

724
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,096
Yeah this is bad delivery I just

725
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
I find I found myself listening

726
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Incredibly

727
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,264
Inspired

728
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
I feel I felt like he was being credibly on it

729
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Good

730
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
The best high-end

731
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
So

732
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Cultural division

733
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,040
When have you not said that like what

734
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
NetSpend

735
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
The talking point you've had four

736
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Ever

737
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,488
Which which is ironic because the first president to be impeached

738
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Was

739
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Trying to sow Discord

740
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Between the boards

741
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
For Rachel reason

742
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
You might be asking yourself why are these Democrats doing this in

743
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:27,104
I was a lot of answers to remove the president for committing crimes like what's really motivated

744
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,944
She committed crimes and we would like to remove him but interesting reason

745
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
The truth is slightly

746
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,368
Supreme Court Justice

747
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
But even if this removal fails they'll say

748
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
We're not going to confirm anybody that was

749
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,120
Justin Peak we're not going to confirm anybody nominated

750
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
By a president like that

751
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
I wish they would

752
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,616
This is so dumb they think impeachment is

753
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,920
Conviction it proof Trump is bad

754
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Changing the subject

755
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,600
Incredible crimes that they've committed all the bad things they've been up to

756
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah this is how Hillary's going to get away with Benghazi find

757
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:18,304
Man I really wish she hadn't put that uranium one on there but here we are

758
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
So this theory is f****** stupid

759
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
But there's no big it was Supreme Court

760
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
Even if Ruth Bader Ginsburg

761
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Republicans already set the precedent that an opposition party can refuse to hold hearings on Supreme Court nominees in election years

762
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
Now this process

763
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
I got a very difficult

764
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Consequently

765
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Process of impeachment

766
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
Is not necessary to achieve the goal of blocking the Supreme

767
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Court nominee

768
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Now with the Democrats do that

769
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
That's another no

770
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
The giant hours

771
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:53,632
Well sure hold on hold on because if you're willing to believe that they would say

772
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,448
Make an entire impeachment in order to reach that goal

773
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
You probably think that have no problem just saying hey you remember the rules you guys that four years ago while we're playing by them now

774
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
No nomination

775
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Fidelity Alexa

776
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
I understand what you're saying but in the world where you believe that this is what they're doing

777
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
Sway public opinion

778
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,744
Destroyed

779
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,376
Anyway my point is that this is not a compelling motive that Alex is suggesting for Wyatt

780
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
Impeachment would go

781
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
Sunnyway everybody's being threatened

782
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
And

783
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
I don't know Alex

784
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
Trying to get

785
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
2

786
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Is big

787
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
Reveal

788
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Okay of what

789
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
The what hour are we in

790
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,112
Still in the first hour better than I expected

791
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,696
But it's if it's probably towards the end of that

792
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
Anyway

793
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Senators being threatened

794
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
And the Supreme Court

795
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Coming into play

796
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
3 months ago

797
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
But they will impeach him in the house

798
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
And when I get to the Senate

799
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
They're going to pull out the stops to Blackmail

800
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Arm-twisting

801
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
Threats against the Senators

802
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
Did the Supreme Court

803
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
Could then be brought into play to claim that people work in partial

804
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,512
A cloud like the Democrats do with the election 3 years ago

805
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
To create the real civil unrest killing in the election year

806
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,056
Calms one to undermine the nation that for their plan

807
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
And so

808
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
They are going

809
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:47,296
They are trying to cause a civil emergency that's why they're going after the guns

810
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Virginia

811
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
Hell yes we're coming for AR-15s

812
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Because you can't

813
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Beat us

814
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Politically they are going to try to

815
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,960
Along racial and along political lines that will tear

816
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
The country

817
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
In

818
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
The pieces

819
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
That is a big gamble

820
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
And it's making the presidency survives an even stronger

821
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
But

822
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,392
They can't help it and have to do it because they're being so politically destroyed

823
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
Father Jeffrey Epstein information coming out

824
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
Really

825
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
Blue cities collapsing

826
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
And their alliance with a chai,

827
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
And the chemical warfare against the American people

828
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,752
That clip is really Alex Jones

829
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
Trevor was one scary ideas disconnected Notions that are being brought together for no reason

830
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
And most importantly references to obscure things

831
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Things that are in no way relevant

832
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,112
Alex has failed to prove in any way that any Senators being threatened and until he does

833
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
I'm going to assume he's just

834
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Make that up

835
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
The Supreme Court may actually need to get involved at some point

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,632
If you have one party that refuses to take things seriously but know they're in the majority so if they

837
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:09,728
Be fine if they just do nothing or they'll get their way what else can you do

838
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,080
I'm not sure that's the right thing to do and I don't even know how that would play out

839
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
I don't know if that's

840
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
The direction things will go but

841
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
Booking a thing

842
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,760
I wouldn't be too surprised if there was some sort of illegal challenge

843
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Subway

844
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
But even so even if the Supreme Court

845
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
Get involved

846
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,768
I've literally zero believe they would do so in a way that would trigger the outbreak of civil unrest or Civil War

847
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
The Supreme Court literally decided the 2000 election

848
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
And though there were consequences of that which we still have not fully atone for it did not lead to Democrats in the street

849
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Rioting

850
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,384
You can make an argument that the right-wing is much more insane right now than the Democrats were in 2000

851
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
And you would be great

852
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,248
But I still think this kind of idea that Alex is selling as a bit of a stretch

853
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
Plus it's a conservative Court

854
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
I would assume they would err on the side of following us

855
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Process

856
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Which favors

857
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
The GOP

858
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Just part of the reason I suspect they won't even

859
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Get involved in the first place

860
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,096
At every point now it's his career the globalist have been

861
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
How to start a civil emergency

862
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Always has to do with going to

863
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
For the gun

864
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
Somehow this

865
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
Never gets old for his fan

866
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
3 *

867
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
Carry-all a new all over again

868
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
Men always getting into the guitar for the gun it was Beto said hell yes we're coming for your guns and he dropped out of the presidential

869
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Race on November 1st

870
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
As best I can tell

871
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,440
He's completely irrelevant to any race in the country you didn't know this but he's

872
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
Quote is still running for president debate you didn't see a big sign that just say

873
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
Hell yes we're coming through AR-15 behind a podium

874
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:48,544
That it did still beat compelling argument

875
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:54,687
Beto's not in any office nor does he seem to be a major force in the larger left-wing conversation

876
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,503
It's not like he dropped out but his guiding the conversation

877
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
The people are having

878
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
As for Virginia Democrats won control of the state legislature in most of the the recent

879
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
Nobody's talking about

880
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,559
So when the Democrats won

881
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
The control of the State Legislature

882
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,655
Turn very blue

883
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:20,543
If there's been some talk of universal background checks possibly being discussed but their legislative session hasn't even

884
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Started yet

885
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
But that doesn't stop some weirdo community members from overreacting to Democrats being in office by stirring up igreja

886
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Paranoia

887
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
According to the hill over 50 counties in Virginia passed resolution

888
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,159
Declaring themselves Second Amendment sanctuary

889
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
Which is not in any way legally binding

890
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
It's just a symbolic act or

891
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Paul Joseph Watson my call it

892
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Virtue signaling

893
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
Nothing happened except Democrats winning elections and immediately the effort to frame any kind of gun debate as encroachment of essential

894
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Begin

895
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
With these counties passing

896
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
What's resolution

897
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,759
Representative Donald mceachin commented that the governor may have to bring in the National Guard at law

898
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Malaysian seasoning

899
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Counties are refusing to

900
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Forest laws

901
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
But

902
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
He wasn't saying

903
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
The governor

904
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
It was just a comment about how is that is a pop

905
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Possible outcome

906
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
But there are law enforcement agent

907
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
Disease that are in essence

908
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Going rogue

909
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
You said quote that's his call because I don't know how serious these counties are

910
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
And how severe the violations of law will be

911
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
But that's obviously an option

912
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
And he has

913
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
According to the car

914
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,687
That is an option the governor hat

915
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
Because he talks about it all the goddamn time

916
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,831
This entire Virginia story is not about actual efforts to come for anyone's gun

917
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:41,439
Although there may be gone laws that are discussed in the next legislative session

918
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,071
5 entirely possible I would assume even with a democratic majority

919
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
Some of that is still going to die

920
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
What is Republican f****** and say whatever the case this is the story of a severe pre-emptive overreaction

921
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
Bygone weirdos

922
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
The Democrats winning election

923
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
It makes more sense

924
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
For Alex to frame it differently

925
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
I'll get these these people they got out they got a

926
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,087
You know they have to do this because they're all there

927
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
Ships coming down

928
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
They're too much trouble

929
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
What's Jeffrey Epstein information coming out is destroying Democrat

930
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
That's exactly

931
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,863
Is it the bunk story about the non missing missing footage that he was talking about earlier

932
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,495
Which blue cities are collapsing

933
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Did you know that

934
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
So which blue cities are collapse

935
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
Jordan and Howard triggering a race war helpful

936
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
Nothing Alex

937
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
It's all just a p

938
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Steve Chavez normal talking point of imagery

939
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
He's trying to build it up to a fever pitch

940
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
It has the vibe of I know you've heard me say all these things before but this time it's for real that's the same Vibe is all.

941
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
The same thing as how he started the show

942
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,679
Like I said this is the most important thing ever before because

943
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,519
Listen to his voice I don't even believe he believes

944
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
It is a

945
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,639
It is unfortunate that Obama didn't

946
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
Do any of the things

947
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Is that they said he

948
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
He was going to

949
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
Because now they're just always going to assume that

950
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
Any Democrat like

951
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
The Fox News and everybody spent

952
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
8 years

953
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,999
Saying that Obama was a dictator who is going to come and take your gun

954
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
And then when he didn't

955
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
They didn't just deflate

956
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,143
And think that all well now that we have different Democrat

957
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
It's they're going to not

958
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,007
Now it's just on Red Alert 100% all the time

959
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,567
Any Democrat is going to take your gun

960
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,919
Alldayeveryday they can't walk back from the facts

961
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,759
Reflected a Centrist black president and it drove them all in

962
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
I was that way

963
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
So Alex

964
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
Skip around

965
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
These comments by Ruth Bader Ginsburg

966
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
Which approves

967
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
That

968
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Supreme Court's going to

969
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
To decide this

970
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Teach my daughter

971
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Alex

972
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
Certainly.

973
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
What is Bader Ginsburg

974
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Play the club coming up next trackman

975
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
Senators

976
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Can be disqualified

977
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,415
Upcoming impeachment trial in they are not impartial

978
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,767
Doubt she doesn't have that power this whole thing is political

979
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
So

980
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
That's not really what you

981
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
I assume that's what exactly what

982
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:35,007
She said word for word along with which she was quoting Cicero I believe

983
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,103
So Ruth Bader Ginsburg was being interviewed while she was being awarded the broken

984
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,175
Berggruen prize for philosophy and culture

985
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
In the interview came up that Trump is being impeached in the

986
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
GOP Senators at literally sat

987
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
They weren't going to be impartial

988
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
She was asked quote

989
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,975
Senator says I've already made up my mind and the trial doesn't exist at the moment

990
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
There's no accountability is

991
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,631
A response was quote if a judge said that a judge would be disqualified from the case

992
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
The day of judgement Ops being impartial and starts

993
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
To do things to please the home crowd that's the day the judge

994
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
You should step down from office

995
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,407
The implication is that a trial should be presided over by impartial judges

996
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,223
And that the impeachment trial in the Senate involves offenders B

997
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
Being sexually judges

998
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,319
Isn't the case so you can read that as her saying get Senators who

999
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
Indicate they've made up their mind pretrial should be disqualified

1000
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,207
But the important thing to remember is that she didn't say

1001
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
She implied that

1002
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,607
And she did so by pointing to an example of a similar situation that we all agree with

1003
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,935
If a judge in a different context was going around being all like

1004
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,239
No matter what I'm going to acquit this guy

1005
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
You would easily recognize that is a problem

1006
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Yeah

1007
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
But

1008
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
The claim Alex is making that RBG

1009
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
That the Senators could be disqualified from the impeach

1010
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
If they aren't impartial that's it

1011
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
The problem that claim is a problem

1012
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Because it's not true

1013
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,135
If that's what she was implying

1014
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
It's very it's very

1015
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,487
Forget the game he's playing is very very

1016
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
It never fails to amaze me how much

1017
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,351
The right-wing thinks

1018
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
Shouldn't be in the Constitution

1019
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Isn't

1020
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,983
And how much they think should be in the Constitution

1021
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
Write like

1022
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:16,127
They will cuz it in the Constitution there's nothing that says you have to be an impartial

1023
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
You're if you're in a senate impeachment

1024
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Which arguably

1025
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,991
Maybe there should have been

1026
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,343
But they when they were writing it they just assumed that nobody would act like this

1027
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,927
These guys were so stupid

1028
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,231
Fathers were idiots

1029
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
Also Alex's idea here is really funny because Trump tweeted quote

1030
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:41,471
Radical left has no case read the transcript shouldn't even be allowed can we go to the Supreme Court to stop

1031
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,591
So Alex is Nightmare scenario where the Supreme Court gets involved is literally what Trump is asking

1032
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Things that happen

1033
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,687
I expected Alex to be all out of sorts about the reality of

1034
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
This impeachment

1035
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
But I really didn't think you'd be this low energy

1036
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Is narrative makes no sense

1037
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
She selling it poorly

1038
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,183
I think he's just beginning to realize that no matter what his name is attached

1039
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
For history

1040
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
And I don't think he thinks that's a great way to be remembered

1041
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
I'll be bummed out if I were him to

1042
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,215
I I can't read any I don't read any Trump tweets I don't

1043
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
I don't read anything to talks about Trump tweets

1044
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
It's because it feels like

1045
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
He's sending a

1046
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Telegram

1047
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Paying by the low

1048
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
Stop

1049
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
If this isn't fair.

1050
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
We're going to

1051
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
You

1052
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,831
How is that okay how is that not an impeachable offense

1053
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
So Alex one of his big things

1054
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Like every he's already said

1055
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:37,791
We've heard it you said that like are all these dumb down people think that this is a conviction

1056
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
And Pelosi

1057
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Is not bringing

1058
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
The

1059
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,959
To that immediately

1060
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:51,103
So it because it will technically be a kangaroo court and it won't

1061
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
You appear like a

1062
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
Conviction

1063
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
That makes sense

1064
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
And so there now

1065
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Having Pelosi

1066
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,623
Say that she's going to withhold sending the Articles up

1067
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
Certifying them

1068
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
So they can just

1069
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
Have that out there that old look

1070
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Trump

1071
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,607
If impeached as if that's a conviction

1072
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
Anna Anna Anna way the tea is discredited

1073
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Waiting

1074
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,055
While they prepare to rollout women saying the president

1075
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,223
Played some people saying the president use the n-word people claiming the president has preparation of tax returns

1076
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
And all sorts of other things

1077
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:36,159
I don't know what accusations Alex thinks are coming that is somehow going to catch fire and actually hurt Trump with his base

1078
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
But I think you shouldn't hold his breath

1079
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:43,583
I mean we've all seen people accused Trump of sexual assault being a racist and being corrupt in his business dealings

1080
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
And none of his supporters

1081
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
Pacific are up till this point so I don't

1082
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,543
I don't understand what Alex's preparing for

1083
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
He himself

1084
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,663
Has backed up those accusations by saying that he did it

1085
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:04,063
It does seem that way a lot of the case he's lying and corrupt like he said he was

1086
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Was in a debate

1087
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
Cohesion

1088
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,463
Committed sexual assault do you mean like

1089
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
He said he did

1090
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,839
If anybody doesn't think you send me Edward

1091
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,495
Even even his supporters are like he said that

1092
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
Yeah I just

1093
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,615
All I think it is that what Alex is doing is

1094
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,967
Trying to find a way to reframe the idea that the house has said that they're going to hold more here

1095
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
And that's that's just

1096
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
He's preparing his audience for whatever information

1097
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
You could come out of those

1098
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
I mean fine

1099
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Whatever

1100
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,951
This is been the big breakdown

1101
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
Gets to the end of the Segway

1102
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,071
And so far I mean I think we've got these

1103
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,447
Misrepresenting a quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg you saying that people are being threatened naturally

1104
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
Like they're trying to

1105
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,775
Trump just because they don't want another

1106
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
Supreme Court nomination

1107
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,151
I don't really think that we've got much of anything

1108
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:10,623
Nintendo remove the president and their real plan with their now

1109
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:17,279
Suppose your rabbit can stop them

1110
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
So we haven't gotten to the plan

1111
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:26,239
We're going to get to the plan next this is all still just Preamble today

1112
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
That's why I felt so meaningless

1113
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
Because it wasn't the plan

1114
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
This show

1115
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Is

1116
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
Ridiculous banana

1117
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,271
Cuz I thought that was the plan that's the only plan

1118
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Yeah

1119
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:42,879
That is all that spawn whenever whatever Democrats actually do what

1120
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
He says they're going to do he's like

1121
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,743
And the plan is with we reveal the plan is going to stop at Menards

1122
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,399
No it won't they already they've told you the plan the plan is to impeach and remove the president using this

1123
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
You can't make up a if we expose the

1124
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
The plan is going to stop them thing for

1125
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
Well they expose the strategy of like if we reveal the plan it will stop them it works really well when you're play

1126
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Plans are nuts

1127
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,759
Exactly because you say something that's completely outlandish

1128
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,319
Suppose the plants they couldn't do that

1129
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
You're the one going to do that

1130
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
That would make sense

1131
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Yeah

1132
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
So we don't

1133
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
What the plan is

1134
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,279
Yet he comes back from break

1135
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
And

1136
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
Expresses that you show

1137
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
Truth

1138
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
I am your host Alex Jones Infowars very existence

1139
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
Pirates your support

1140
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:44,319
This is information Warfare this is truth and on

1141
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
Vicious life-and-death

1142
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,255
That's not melon

1143
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
As the saxophone crescendos

1144
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,983
Where we are people take

1145
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
Everything from Ash

1146
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,615
Don't start standing up for ourselves our let me lay it out

1147
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
So this is like the true reason

1148
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
3 reason

1149
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
Play You Belong To The City is a f******

1150
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,783
Bangers

1151
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Second reason

1152
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,135
Alex literally says this is truth

1153
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
That's his opinion

1154
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
This feeling

1155
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:27,327
Great that is the blurring of the presentation

1156
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,887
That's the only circumstance

1157
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
In this episode where Alex

1158
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
Really feels inspired is when he's doing these voice overs over swelling Saxbys

1159
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,687
How come you're not the only time that you see life and Amber's what he's doing these

1160
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
If we don't stop them

1161
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
They will take everything from

1162
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
Don LaFontaine he's dead

1163
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,791
He's sober he just wants to do like overly dramatic

1164
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,375
Threats yeah over over symphonic

1165
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
What's Goosebumps

1166
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,959
Yeah that can't do that for four hours

1167
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,287
He wants to do what he was doing

1168
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
In the past

1169
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
Singing with along with The Highwaymen

1170
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:16,735
And s*** like that that's the only time you see the spark of like this is a person otherwise it

1171
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
Spiccato

1172
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
This is

1173
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Are playing

1174
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,391
They wanna divide

1175
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Pearl Harbor was fake

1176
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,791
See I kind of think he would wind up getting more listeners and viewers if he

1177
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
He did go back to that sing along with s***

1178
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,423
I think people would tune in way more just because they like

1179
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,007
This guy used to be f****** crazy and now look at how crazy he is

1180
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,567
Crazy in an entertaining

1181
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,663
The problem with Alex right now is that

1182
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,687
He could be

1183
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
Super

1184
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
Super popular

1185
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:54,111
If you would just drop a lot of this b******* would legitimately be

1186
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,671
Be somebody the people with TuneIn and walk to watch

1187
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,207
And he could do it

1188
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
I think

1189
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
But the problem is

1190
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,351
How do you get from A to B

1191
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,935
Is probably marketable in this climate

1192
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:14,591
Have to figure out how to shed yourself as you describe it all of these necklaces is Rock necklace

1193
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,919
Design for himself Better Way yourself

1194
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,015
Can I put on One Straight yeah it's tough but if you can figure out a way to do that I think

1195
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
You probably

1196
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,111
Find a way to have the fungus over this

1197
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
Saxophone

1198
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,511
Not good not fun part where he has to try and come up with absurd reasons

1199
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,071
For why his hero is getting impeached

1200
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,863
Here's a here's how I would do it

1201
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,215
Here's what I would do I would turn it into like the the movie Airheads

1202
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
I swear it's like

1203
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,055
We're going under a station restructuring so I wanted

1204
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
Keep doing the infowar but instead I'm just

1205
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
Anything over the highway

1206
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:53,247
It's not me it's my manager is up at the top

1207
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,319
Everybody I told Addison Claire

1208
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,623
Want me to sing

1209
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:05,791
If I were Sinclair I think that would be the way I would be amazing

1210
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,607
What are you just to ditch our podcast where they like guys

1211
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,679
Craziest

1212
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103
I don't know if we're going to keep going or not but we're doing this episode first we are keeping going

1213
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,663
Karaoke from now on

1214
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
The dream job

1215
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,783
We thought we'd gone to the Planned Parent Lee.

1216
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Got to lay it out now though

1217
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
Saxophone

1218
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Take a break

1219
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
That'd take a break

1220
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
A good swelling snacks

1221
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,839
Is is a short circuit into anybody's brain is totally

1222
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,119
I know Alex has inspired

1223
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
I lay it all alright

1224
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
Let me lay it out

1225
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,751
Is really four different one

1226
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
Tuesday really like

1227
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:52,639
Those four scenarios busted really like what are they doing

1228
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,503
Like if we got it we got it

1229
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,063
Here's the first one but here's the first option

1230
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,439
They created a blackmail enough Hysteria

1231
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
Enough problems on a pressure on the Senators

1232
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,703
Bring up while they're holding

1233
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
The Articles from the Senate

1234
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
Another Law Firm

1235
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
And then

1236
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
And they vote to removing they say for the better the country

1237
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,415
Was just going on too long there's too many bad things.

1238
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
Now this latest thing even though it's not in the trial

1239
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279
I just I just I just have to go to the present

1240
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
What they really want

1241
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:50,751
This is a stupid theory in space on nothing other than his own fantasies

1242
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,335
Goes on in serious places in the world you would never be welcomed in

1243
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,639
But this is really useful as a narrative

1244
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:01,503
You need to provide some reason for your listeners not to completely turn on the GOP

1245
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,319
In the off chance that some Senators do end up voting

1246
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
Convect

1247
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,391
Alex remembers the Ron Paul days

1248
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:12,511
And how impossible it would be for him to ever be anywhere near power if you went with a third-party tried to

1249
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Create a party

1250
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
It's just you know it

1251
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
You knows it it's imperative

1252
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
Keep things under the GOP wing

1253
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,215
I tried to continue to corrupt it from the inside

1254
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
The other path is too hard

1255
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,311
And insisting that if any GOP Senators voted

1256
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:30,175
It's only because the globalist or hitting them with hard with tons of blackmail

1257
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
Often the backlash against

1258
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
The party a little not their fault

1259
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:39,391
It's not strong but they're not strong enough to kill their children exactly

1260
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
Also this is never going to

1261
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
What would you do in that

1262
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
This plan is never gone

1263
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,071
Just toss out that one

1264
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,447
Most that was the one that they wanted to happen most that's implied you okay all right here's the second option

1265
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
The other one

1266
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
Is it

1267
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,639
Supreme Court says it's political

1268
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,479
Events so far

1269
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,319
And that trigger civil unrest

1270
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
And anger

1271
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,927
Blackmailing members of Trumps cabinet and the Senate

1272
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,743
25th Amendment to the United States

1273
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,447
Beyonce concert becomes unable to the job the president becomes

1274
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Present

1275
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
We could happen for just

1276
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,591
The present time

1277
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,895
Until the end

1278
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
Incapacitated

1279
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
So that's the

1280
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
I want

1281
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:50,047
Took buddy if the 25th Amendment hasn't been invoked yet it's never going yet

1282
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,191
For the people that have political Rivals recently dead husband might be in hell and nothing happened so don't worry about the 25th

1283
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,007
No he's it's because he makes too much sense

1284
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,079
Stan honestly this option is really convoluted

1285
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:08,479
If I understand it correctly Alex was saying that a part of the Supreme Court will save that they impeach miss being handled inappropriately

1286
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,879
Really this was somehow set off civil unrest at which point the senators of people in the cabinet who are being blackmailed

1287
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:20,511
Fifth Amendment to get Trump out of office

1288
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Now Jordan

1289
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,351
I would posit that none of this is necessary

1290
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,679
First of all as I mentioned earlier Trump tweeted that he wanted this

1291
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,727
Supreme Court vote

1292
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
What's narrative little

1293
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Secondly

1294
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,639
Everything up to the point of the Senators being blackmailed it's completely superfluous

1295
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:41,247
If the end goal is getting senators and people in the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment

1296
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,295
All of that can be achieved through the black

1297
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,855
You don't need the Supreme Court to get in the mix

1298
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,207
Which then kicks off the civil unrest which then supplements the blackmail

1299
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Mail or something

1300
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,535
It's an overly complicated overwritten

1301
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Narrative that makes no sense

1302
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,447
From the standpoint of the imaginary conspirator wrong the blackmail

1303
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,007
Hidden by the social unrest

1304
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,127
That way the Senators don't have to say they're being blackmailed they're being

1305
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
Influenced by their voters.

1306
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
And page or retract your statement now

1307
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:17,087
No one ever says I'm being blackmailed that's why I doing this

1308
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,463
I suspect that this is just a way for Alex to prepare to delegitimize any left-wing protest

1309
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
That might happen surrounding the impeachment

1310
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Process

1311
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:31,423
I just try and put it as they're playing into the globalist and for something to happen either

1312
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,959
Second option

1313
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,519
Off the table not realistic in any way

1314
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,079
I do love the situation where

1315
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
Where in being so

1316
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,919
Insanely simple

1317
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
And yet

1318
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,015
Spiraling into the most complicated version of Reality Week

1319
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,063
Like here's how this should work

1320
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Because it's fairly simple

1321
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,415
The house impeaches the president

1322
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
The Senate access impartial jurors

1323
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
The evidence is presented since there's no Excel pittore evidence whatsoever that anybody has brought forth

1324
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,447
There's not being allowed to call them but

1325
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,799
Select called I promise that allowed

1326
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,871
He will be removed from office it's a very straightforward issue

1327
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
But because

1328
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
People don't want that to happen

1329
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,271
We have 10 million different games

1330
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
The articles

1331
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Hippie sent yet because

1332
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,695
Mitch McConnell to corrupt a we're still need a drama public opinion to put pressure on him and it's like

1333
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,999
This Is Us

1334
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:32,863
The game the game between played by Alex is a lot crazier

1335
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Get those first two option

1336
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Bat

1337
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Not not going to happen

1338
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
And those are the two they most prefer that's implied yes specify that the global

1339
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
Where's the Third

1340
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
See if you can

1341
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,295
The similarities

1342
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
Civil unrest

1343
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,367
Violence

1344
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
Breakdown

1345
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Kill the economy

1346
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
And that

1347
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,607
Causes of a crisis

1348
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,143
For them to win the election

1349
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
And or step down

1350
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
This is very dumb

1351
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:15,871
Trump thrives on civil unrest and no amount of it is going to cause him to step down from office

1352
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,527
This is a doodoo leaned into the unite the right rally where neo-nazis chanted blood and soil in a woman was killed

1353
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,343
It's not like he's a guy who would say a people are hurting

1354
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,927
For the good of the country I've got to step down that point will never

1355
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
Happened now

1356
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
I think this is just a pre-emptive rationalization for the possible loss that will

1357
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
In the 2020 election

1358
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
Sure we could have one but there was that civil unrest

1359
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:42,495
Stryker stock market so technically we kind of did actually wins of the globalist cause adult chair

1360
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
Good way to piano no matter what I didn't lose even if I lost it's only because

1361
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,943
Cuz you cheated this option mean

1362
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Nothing

1363
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
Also this is the last scenario

1364
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
Any Enter he said far

1365
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
Rural areas

1366
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
33

1367
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,231
Alex forgot that there was four

1368
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,815
Two are complete bulshit total.

1369
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
Is meaningless

1370
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
So he's not even

1371
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:14,751
The sky is so over it

1372
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
Like they'd find a way to win the election

1373
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
Yeah

1374
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,431
That's the entire thing I mean he's saying that they're using a bunch of different steps but it could be

1375
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
The point in

1376
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
Option number three is they win the

1377
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Right

1378
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
In any number of different ways

1379
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,415
Sure but they're going to do it by civil unrest that plunges the stock

1380
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
I mean okay

1381
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
I guess

1382
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Right

1383
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
Or they could do it differently

1384
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,679
There's a lot of different ways to win an election

1385
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,519
Just come down to we lose we lose the election

1386
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,079
But he's really focused on this civil unrest stuff

1387
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
And he knows that the globalist

1388
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,407
Planned this

1389
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
And he can prove it

1390
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
To you and

1391
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
This is not this feeling

1392
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
This is fact

1393
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
How much civil unrest could they get I'm just type in

1394
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Infowars.com

1395
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
And then

1396
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
Obama. Michelle Obama planning martial law in Maryland 2015 we got those

1397
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
South 19th

1398
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Confirm

1399
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,447
30 pages of antifa secret documents

1400
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:20,287
Hollywood go in and break things working with the police in blue cities

1401
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Police matters

1402
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Yeah

1403
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,063
Wyatt it didn't work

1404
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
Back on screen

1405
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,463
So they tell me this is just the 4chan Soros antifa documents that Alex found online

1406
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,303
They is presenting as like this is proof that it's been confirmed

1407
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Found that online

1408
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:49,471
So it is next to B really interesting because Alex tells how he got those documents okay

1409
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
And it's not

1410
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
True

1411
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,615
That article is more important today than it was January 2018

1412
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Please go read this

1413
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Vans family

1414
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
We got threatened we got told

1415
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,303
You stop that we're going to struggle to get lawsuits in man on week later they also get file

1416
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
But they are so pissed we got those

1417
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Smoking Gun

1418
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,751
Kind of criminal charge racketeering

1419
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
Who is the headphones

1420
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Nationwide

1421
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,967
So the guy that that was the story that was on 4chan I remember that was the guy's brother found

1422
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,527
Yep I remember that one. How elex got them

1423
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,319
I watch that episode

1424
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,415
I remember this very clearly Alex's intern Harrison Smith

1425
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,743
Kmart air said he found them on 4chan

1426
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,935
Yep good now Alex's turned the story that was posted on for 10 today heroically got in touch with Infowars

1427
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:57,311
He's turned it into his own story of finding the documents

1428
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
This is this

1429
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,431
Do you know what I bet Alex thinks that is what

1430
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,271
Oh no I agree I totally believe you remembers it now because of like

1431
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
Use mythologized

1432
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
The retelling of

1433
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,439
The story over and over and over again that it feels real to him

1434
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,839
That this guy's brother is like

1435
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,423
Is interred with lurking unfortunate foundries

1436
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,007
Fake documents that they decided to pass off as real

1437
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
It's like a fishtail but it with

1438
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,663
Bucking potentially world-changing information if any of it should be real

1439
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,247
Is like this big

1440
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,295
My God that's the thing man

1441
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
These documents

1442
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Contract

1443
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,951
Between antifa and Sora and that's why you got to worry about sore

1444
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
Because because of contract

1445
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Soros does sump

1446
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
The contract

1447
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:57,471
Leave a paper trail of his bad stuff like anything for an info Warrior 2

1448
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,567
So because Soros is so bad it makes

1449
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
Other people who

1450
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Here bad

1451
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
They're not that bad

1452
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
This is an attack

1453
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
To take our country down

1454
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,879
I mean they demonized Putin because he just has all the Soros ads you aren't rushing

1455
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,583
And Rogers at work with him get arrested

1456
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,143
Usher you can protest all you want

1457
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
You get your ass arrested

1458
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:39,455
That's what's going on as family show

1459
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,039
I love listening to your phone's words with your tanning

1460
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:46,623
Soros is trying to teach Karate Kid not to suck cock

1461
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,743
Who

1462
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,535
I'm going to leave that just sort of

1463
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Sitting out there

1464
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
Russian

1465
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
Absolutely

1466
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
Demonstrate freely

1467
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Organize

1468
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
Doll just

1469
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Zorro

1470
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:07,871
LaRosa's instigating against the the Russian government that's amazing

1471
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
That is the most fascist argument you can

1472
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,759
Possibly know everybody has the right

1473
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
To protest

1474
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
Except for these people

1475
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:21,183
Whomever they may be based on a fictional thing that I create and change it my win

1476
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:27,583
If Alex is dying the entirety of anti-fascism

1477
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
Fake documents imagine that anybody would be able to falsely connect any protest

1478
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,383
Everybody has the right to free and fair protest except for

1479
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
For people who are against

1480
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Fascism

1481
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,223
That sure seems to be his

1482
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
So

1483
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
Alex's pretty mad

1484
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,623
About people inciting violence

1485
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
And he gets around saying that

1486
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,071
Within a very short clip Alex takes issue with people

1487
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
Inciting violence

1488
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
And then

1489
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,215
By the end of it is saying the Trump should get the military involved

1490
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
So

1491
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,287
This clip takes a little bit of a ride

1492
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:13,919
If I was running around trying to get people to go kill people or burn things for a conspiracy

1493
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,551
To commit Mayhem and crime and disorder and I spend lots of prison and I should

1494
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
I'd never do that

1495
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,975
Committing crimes

1496
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,327
Enough

1497
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:39,007
Job and I wanted to put them on notice

1498
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,039
That's pretty extreme

1499
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
Okay. All right

1500
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,487
That's pretty standard for Alex that's pretty far for the course of where he's at

1501
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
These days

1502
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
You did this like this is the most important show I'm ever going to do

1503
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,191
I'm going to lay out the globalist plan there's four scenarios

1504
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,287
There's only there's only 3/8 just an incompetent display of

1505
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
Dumbass

1506
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
And then we now see

1507
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,639
You started to talk about Soros and

1508
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,919
Contract

1509
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,527
All the civil unrest if you started to work himself up and now he's starting to get

1510
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
Angry at the violence is

1511
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
And you can start to feel it bubble

1512
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,023
Throughout rest of the show across the Rubicon I wanted to drain the Rubicon entirely

1513
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,327
Kill a trimmer

1514
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,655
Working on a theory for a little while Matt is that Alex doesn't

1515
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
No

1516
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Bolsonaro

1517
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,799
Okay or at least has completely forgotten okay okay

1518
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,103
And he said bolsonaro before

1519
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,503
Wayback the guy in Brazil

1520
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,527
Clip I think

1521
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,807
We get more evidence

1522
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
It may be he

1523
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,879
He's trying to learn his name

1524
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:03,231
This is scaring the hell out of levels were this close to taking this country down

1525
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,375
Mouthpieces

1526
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
I appreciate that he tried

1527
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,575
Saudi impeachment is happening it's going to go to the Senate

1528
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367
Alex is a lot of feelings about this

1529
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,439
Is being done by the letter of the Constitution

1530
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
Yes

1531
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Support which it is being done

1532
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,559
For somebody who's making such a narc

1533
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Really know what the

1534
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
Constitution entail disagreement

1535
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,007
Situation you got to know how the impeachment is supposed to be run

1536
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,311
This clip does not Inspire confidence

1537
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
Okay me that Alex knows

1538
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,639
Anything about what he's talkin to

1539
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,687
Curious Ginsburg

1540
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,247
Suggesting Senators can be disqualified

1541
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,807
From upcoming impeachment

1542
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:05,183
The branches are equal so one doesn't take over the other they keep each other in check

1543
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Show the Supreme Court

1544
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,911
Where are you

1545
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
Supermajority

1546
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
That's

1547
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
Crazy what if

1548
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
The 2/3

1549
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:39,487
So it was two-thirds against 1/3 and they were somehow tied at the end of it there cannot be a tie in the Senate when a tooth

1550
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:45,631
Majority is required to pass something I disagree this is super advantageous

1551
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,191
This is because you would never want a tie in the Senate

1552
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,239
Since the vice president is also the president

1553
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
And gets

1554
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
The cast of o2 tiebreaking situation

1555
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:57,663
Do you never want that to come up is cuz the vice president becomes president

1556
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
The presidents removed

1557
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
Really don't want to have to deal with the Optics of cats

1558
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
Tiebreaker vote

1559
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
The Macy's present

1560
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
But

1561
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
It doesn't

1562
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,647
Matter because

1563
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:14,047
Anti braking situations and impeachment trials in the Senate are provided over by the chief just

1564
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,327
The Supreme Court

1565
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:21,727
The tie-breaking vote would go to the Chief Justice

1566
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,287
Are possible

1567
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
Conviction vote

1568
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,639
Oh yeah it's about like rule change

1569
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,455
Situations all you need

1570
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,479
Simple majority

1571
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
Edit those cases

1572
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
The Chief Justice

1573
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,087
Presiding over the trial would be the tiebreaker

1574
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Either way.

1575
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,903
Vice president doesn't come into play in this

1576
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,487
It's crazy that he really doesn't know what he's talking

1577
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:49,887
Thanks for the vice-president we cast the tie-breaking vote or is there still a tie the Supreme Court

1578
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
Get the ball

1579
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,495
UB realizes in the middle that it's a 2/3

1580
01:15:55,263 --> 01:16:00,639
Wow and that makes even less sense historically just because the vice president president

1581
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
Weren't originally on a ticket

1582
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:07,295
Together right it was whoever whoever got the the first and second post book

1583
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Sew-in that's

1584
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Situation

1585
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,159
If the vice president is the guy who got the second-most votes in was like

1586
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,559
Hey somehow this one vote I'm going to test makes me president this is non-partisan guys

1587
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Ripped it all

1588
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Yeah so that

1589
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,983
Inspires very little confidence whenever Alex goes on these rants about how they're not going according to

1590
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
I could con

1591
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,591
Tucson and he says stuff like that I just got to think like

1592
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Alright you're not good source for this or the information

1593
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,199
I'm going to go ahead and check out

1594
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:40,063
The people most likely to carry a constitution in their pocket or somehow also the people least likely

1595
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Play two of Reddit

1596
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Kind of amazing

1597
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,279
Anyway the Dagobah stew desperate cuz they're breaking Constitution doing all this impeach

1598
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Stuff

1599
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
And that means

1600
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,119
False flag from stuff

1601
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,167
Understand

1602
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,959
I think you know this better than I

1603
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
This is real

1604
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:02,335
The globalist want civil unrest they want a war

1605
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:09,503
They're probably looking to bomb Federal buildings and blame it on talk radio like I didn't 95

1606
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
What they saw as the voice of the people

1607
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
Tell me the internet this time

1608
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,183
And so it was yummy mashed shootings or bombings

1609
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,999
Brother false-flag to create racial and cultural division

1610
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,303
We're entering the zone right now

1611
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Everybody's gotta be alert

1612
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,375
Academy watchful

1613
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:29,983
Woodlawn forcement because this country fighting for his life this is very serious

1614
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,055
The next 300-plus days are Max Amore

1615
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,335
Maximum

1616
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
This country is at War

1617
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,943
All I hear is Alex being aware that the

1618
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
The community

1619
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,735
That he

1620
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Inspires

1621
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
Disconnected with

1622
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,111
Yep are in such of mode

1623
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,159
That bomb in the building is pasa

1624
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,975
Yeah yeah yeah like all I hear is it like

1625
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,535
Okay we are in a situation where

1626
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,119
Extreme element of

1627
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Our side

1628
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,191
Put very easily

1629
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
So unstable person

1630
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
You could very easily

1631
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:08,639
The song tragedy happening to me is preemptive

1632
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,455
Narrative building

1633
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,503
Man the number of

1634
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Emails and

1635
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,343
Tweets and all this s*** that he's aware of

1636
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
All from his people pointing

1637
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
But like all of this stuff is

1638
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
Create an atmosphere where he's like

1639
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,863
I know that somebody who listens to my show may very well do

1640
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
And I better

1641
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,447
Get in front of this request

1642
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
Possum yeah yeah

1643
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:40,383
It got everything that it's going to happen already knows that somebody is about to do it but the climate that easy

1644
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
Can't not know

1645
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,735
Not in my climate you're well

1646
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
There's a possibility

1647
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
Yeah it is the same way there was

1648
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,159
Verizon

1649
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,487
I understand that

1650
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
L-lysine

1651
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Is crack

1652
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,191
Yeah call IC is the the Geico awareness if there's a possibility we better be ready if that had him

1653
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,055
So we'll go build this narrative in advance

1654
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,127
I don't think it is unless you pay attention

1655
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Is I think

1656
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
I think if you buy into Alex's

1657
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,759
Probably would see that as like

1658
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
Yeah yeah yeah

1659
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Lazarbeam

1660
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,719
Right like I think if you're not aware that's okay

1661
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Here's where everything

1662
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,119
Alex starts taking calls

1663
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,447
And you get a caller who asked one of the more upsetting question

1664
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,471
That I've ever heard

1665
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,007
How do you shave

1666
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,079
Your privates if not it's okay

1667
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,383
Question is along the lines of

1668
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,199
What is the time to start shooting people and

1669
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
Follow up

1670
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,039
Who should I point my gun at

1671
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,623
Now I'm going to play this clip in its entirety the little bit longer

1672
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
But I think it's important to see

1673
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
See how Alex

1674
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,463
Response to this question

1675
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
So here's my question

1676
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,583
Hypothetical situation hypothetically

1677
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Some point in the neck

1678
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Montpelier

1679
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,519
The Democrats get their way through illegal means

1680
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,592
What happened to go Connecticut

1681
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:19,200
I've been trying to get through

1682
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
People like me

1683
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
You know I mean

1684
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
Neighbors that are Democrat

1685
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
People

1686
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,256
I know some pretty crazy liberals that

1687
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
Do some pretty crazy things but

1688
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
We've got a Caballo.

1689
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
Representative

1690
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,704
People that call themselves Democrats

1691
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,568
I mean the average individual is not in a position to reactive

1692
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,896
Violence

1693
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,504
Trump economy but old people hostage

1694
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,832
Legislatively accept open borders and globalism

1695
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
And and

1696
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:04,512
Turn the economy back on like they did when Obama got in they turn the economy off

1697
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:09,632
Drano bomb a partially back on once he got in so obviously

1698
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:14,496
The police aren't yet

1699
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:18,848
You remember when I sent the guy to try to kill the Republican baseball team

1700
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
Caucus

1701
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,688
Call installation other they tried

1702
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,272
How to fire the gun right but he went and found

1703
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,552
The leadership

1704
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
So

1705
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,880
What you have there what the

1706
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,160
What did he just say

1707
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Right

1708
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,512
Cuz all that stuff in the immediate answer to the question

1709
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,048
Is buffer that's just

1710
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Valentine

1711
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:45,472
The actual answer to the question begins when he says

1712
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Isn't it

1713
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
The guy who went and shot it

1714
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Scalise

1715
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
Had the right idea

1716
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,664
Because it was the other team who did

1717
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
Whatever the case

1718
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Alex's

1719
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,880
Expressing to this caller

1720
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,952
Democratic Leadership is where

1721
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
Go go get them

1722
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
That was when things get hot

1723
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,608
That was a guy asking

1724
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,424
Permission hypothetically

1725
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,752
In the same way that he's that that some do to be like in 4 a.m.

1726
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,056
Hypothetically if I asked you out on a date

1727
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,592
How should I do it

1728
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
India

1729
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
Because if the answer is yes

1730
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:29,504
You're like haha I'm actually do it'll be a no you're barely hiding behind hypothetically

1731
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
Asking for a friend yeah that's

1732
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
Bucked up

1733
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,368
Anthony response

1734
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,696
You know he eat

1735
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,720
Equivocates a little

1736
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,280
I'm not saying you should hunt down Democrats

1737
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:46,144
Cuz I think he realizes we gotten into dicey water here

1738
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,448
Anybody should go Target Democrats like that

1739
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,776
Civil War guns and

1740
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,080
Cracking down and stuff

1741
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
These are firing tube

1742
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,408
General

1743
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
High-value Target

1744
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:06,112
Wheelhouse

1745
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:09,952
But everything that you described as being

1746
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:14,816
Characteristics of being in that wheelhouse are the features of your rhetoric

1747
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,400
Stay going after Patriot leaders hunting them down

1748
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:23,264
All you talk about is how these lawsuits against you are the government and the globalist

1749
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,664
Trying to take you down you are the leader of the Patriots of your conception that qualification has been filled

1750
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,200
Gun

1751
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:35,040
Every single day their stories about how they're going after the gun

1752
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,344
Yep all of the qualifications for the

1753
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,928
A situation wherein you might hunt down the Democratic Leadership

1754
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
Is satisfied

1755
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
If you listen to his show

1756
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,024
You giving this

1757
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
F****** answer that is so discordant

1758
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
That is so out of lot like

1759
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
Know what you think

1760
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
Izzy's dance

1761
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,240
Dancing around

1762
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,032
You don't you don't know what the answer is

1763
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,824
But the answer is irresponsible

1764
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
I think the answer in his heart is

1765
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,688
Is it bad for business if you start shooting people

1766
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:06,272
But it's good for business if I tell you to shoot people and you don't

1767
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,928
It's good for business if I make sure to not tell you to do this

1768
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:17,024
Do it'll be a false flag

1769
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Yeah if you know

1770
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,584
You got it you got to do what you got to do

1771
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
This is really bad

1772
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,472
But he wants you to know not to be violin

1773
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:29,568
Offensively but then he also later talks about how a good defense

1774
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
What is a good offense

1775
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,872
It's a little bit murky

1776
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
But

1777
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,712
Hope you violent there's another solution

1778
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:41,344
There's big riots in the street people

1779
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,904
Take care of your children get the word out

1780
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,464
It's all information Warfare at this point

1781
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:51,072
To counter whatever they removed from

1782
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:57,472
Vintage go confront

1783
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,568
Chain Reaction must watch info Warrior

1784
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:04,640
Citizen's arrest on Adam Schiff

1785
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
Just as incredible as this

1786
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,504
So the answer is make me viral content

1787
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Yep

1788
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,368
Hey look I know you're asking me

1789
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,696
Who I should shoot at if the trouble happens

1790
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,768
Make me a video

1791
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:27,680
Actually there are high value targets in the police had the right idea

1792
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Yeah right

1793
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,984
Make me a video

1794
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
Right

1795
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,848
That is why the first try to get me promotional ads

1796
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,640
Stop liking monetize

1797
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,432
Hit me some videos

1798
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
Bananas

1799
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,296
Does bananas that anybody would act

1800
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,952
It makes sense like in the olden times when everybody was f****** stupid and starving all the time but we're with we're now

1801
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,608
You know who this is now this is not how you should be interacting with a caller who asks you who do I point my

1802
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:01,472
Yeah please do not cosplay steampunk Civil War on a f****** radio show

1803
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,544
If someone calls in and ask who I should point my gun at

1804
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,104
You should either talk them down or

1805
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,432
Get off the air gun at get them

1806
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,992
The ground instead of a deer

1807
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
Instead Alex keep stalking

1808
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,808
Intuit and the collar

1809
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,832
Reframes the quest

1810
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
To ask

1811
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,136
Where's the lion

1812
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:26,048
Military

1813
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,216
Do the right thing

1814
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
I get the real question I'm asking what

1815
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,616
What is the where is the the legal

1816
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:46,528
Line that gets crossed

1817
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,344
Stage some stuff make us all look bad

1818
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
This is the bad guy

1819
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:55,232
And then everybody that could pitch like me websites not going to happen

1820
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Happy

1821
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,632
Alex already knows with the prior context of this question is

1822
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,424
Who should I point my gun at

1823
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:07,520
When does caller is asking where is the line legally

1824
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,544
It's already crossed

1825
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,824
He's talking about

1826
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,872
The question is already at yeah

1827
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,432
A Perales to emphatically in immediately

1828
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,480
Interrupt

1829
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,760
That is

1830
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,320
Incitement

1831
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
In a certain

1832
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
Consent

1833
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
You could

1834
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:25,184
Read that as him being like

1835
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,720
It's fair game yeah

1836
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Yeah

1837
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,144
Alex I've already told you the smart thing to do and I've already told you that the conditions for it have technically been

1838
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,936
He can't be this oblivious

1839
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,240
To not realize that this is

1840
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,800
A message that this caller could very easily be getting

1841
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
This is so dangerous

1842
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,640
This is really really really dangerous

1843
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,176
Yeah I think this guy is a

1844
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Expressing

1845
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Common confusion

1846
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,576
I ate like a very American

1847
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Confusion

1848
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
About

1849
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
When to do

1850
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
Revolution

1851
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:01,536
Because if you go back and look at the original Revolutionary War

1852
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,352
All of the conditions that caused that

1853
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Are probably

1854
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,192
You could consider far less extreme

1855
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,984
In regards to

1856
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,544
Debatable

1857
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:19,200
So that confusion of like both lionizing and and celebrating the Revolutionary War as

1858
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
The best thing we could have done

1859
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
Ever

1860
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,528
With

1861
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,344
Continued a non-violent soap

1862
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,416
You know it's really difficult for a lot of these

1863
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,208
Especially these Gunn weirdo.

1864
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,232
Yeah I think it is

1865
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,256
Is it is

1866
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
I agree

1867
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,840
So the answer is really

1868
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,144
Revising

1869
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,216
The past

1870
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Is Trump should have just

1871
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
Everybody up

1872
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,384
So Alex

1873
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,176
Says that he should have just jailed opposition

1874
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,576
He's almost giving a list of targets

1875
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:02,976
There should have been indictments a long time ago because there weren't indictment it created a vacuum relief people to run wild

1876
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
Calling

1877
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,680
Instead of calling your Senators represent

1878
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
Portland

1879
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,056
These criminals are acting against

1880
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:27,040
And I go to these little C apartment they haven't been getting it safely long which they need that pressure put on them

1881
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,584
Ford Foundation people in

1882
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,240
If it goes Connecticut

1883
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,056
It is another word kinetic

1884
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,592
So yeah

1885
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,640
Look beat the issue here

1886
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:58,528
Is that the caller has already asked at the beginning of this when it goes kinetic

1887
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,088
At the end of this is Alex's going out to break

1888
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
Not only is he saying

1889
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,672
Soros and soros's son

1890
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,976
Everybody involved in the CFR

1891
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,512
Liberal professors

1892
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
American Turd

1893
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,120
These are the enemies when it goes kinetic

1894
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:18,240
This is he if you can't read that any other way than to say

1895
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,312
Weather a first of all the line is already been cross guy

1896
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
And

1897
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,224
These are the people who are the enemies when you have already asked me who should I point my gun at yeah it May 8th makes

1898
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,552
Even BB then see a fancy yeah

1899
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
If they just

1900
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,624
Kind of logical sense

1901
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
He's telling

1902
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,952
Is Guy a list of people who are the enemies

1903
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,512
He should be pointing his gun at when it goes Connecticut

1904
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,304
This is not okay

1905
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
This is this is like

1906
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,400
A black what's happening

1907
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,192
Is I hear this discordant

1908
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Cognitive

1909
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
Dissonance

1910
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,776
Where it's like

1911
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:56,384
He's saying what he knows he should be saying whenever the question is direct like

1912
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,432
Who should I be trying to murder

1913
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:03,296
And he's like you should not be murdering people make me a promotional video right but then whenever it's

1914
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320
Rephrase

1915
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
He can't understand that the

1916
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,624
Questions are connect

1917
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
He thinks they're completely separate

1918
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:15,072
So then he's like then he gets back into head legal now it'd be okay because of that someone

1919
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
I still don't know who this is illegal

1920
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
I think it

1921
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Something is illegal

1922
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
It's just

1923
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,056
Wrong there's no way

1924
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,080
It's just

1925
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,872
The only

1926
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,224
There's no way that you can understand words the way they're meant to be understood

1927
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:35,808
And not think that he is giving people an idea of who they

1928
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:42,208
The only way you can defend yourself is that you say he doesn't understand the word

1929
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:48,864
Or how to apply there so he needs to be taken off air a public safety

1930
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
The message

1931
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
He is dangerous by

1932
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,984
Is on

1933
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
Inability

1934
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,568
Yeah absolutely it is irresponsible to allow him to

1935
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,920
Ba-Ba-Reeba able to speak to this

1936
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,088
Civil War is not Gunn Connecticut

1937
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,904
Okay but one worth it is Connecticut Vermont

1938
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
No okay we're on

1939
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Play the clip of

1940
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,264
A crime committed

1941
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,592
Well now College official don't buy Christmas presents

1942
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,384
The fight climate change

1943
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
These people are just sick

1944
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,760
Is complete bulshit story here

1945
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,320
Is about somebody works for William and Mary name

1946
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,392
Calandra Waters Lake

1947
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,976
Step back and remember that the reason for the gift is to show someone you care

1948
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,536
So is buying a gift the best way to do that

1949
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,376
Going out and doing something with the recipient spend time with that may be a better option

1950
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
Now is some Christian puns

1951
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:01,824
Where to say the exact same thing making the point that Christmas has become too commercialized in the Jesus is the reason for the season

1952
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:08,224
Alex would 100% be in favor of that antique materialist mess

1953
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,504
He believes in Asia Christian

1954
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,088
Mutiso on board because this person was giving the same advice and then

1955
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,672
Minding your carbon footprint all of a sudden it's devils

1956
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,280
It should so dumb that even the article on Infowars had to call itself out

1957
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:27,936
Ironically however some of her other tips are actually quite useful in terms of combating materialism and consumer

1958
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,472
Prism even if that wasn't

1959
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,496
Exactly the entire

1960
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:33,824
This is which I say go to bed assholes f*** off

1961
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,176
You're not good luck you not going to make this War on Christmas s*** work if that's the best

1962
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
No this is

1963
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:45,344
You can't have the when do we start shooting in the Civil War on the same episode as

1964
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,648
When do we start shooting in the war on Christmas

1965
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,720
Like you're there these people a cartoon

1966
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,256
That's cartoonish

1967
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:57,632
Consider that the war on Christmas which has been going on since the f****** late 80s now

1968
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:03,776
Combined with the Civil War you're like well both of these are equal airtime

1969
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:10,176
Tulsa with Neil Gorsuch people were more mad about him chilling a book on Fox & Friends and not other Outlet

1970
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,712
Wow he's a Supreme Court Justice

1971
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,344
People who pointed out that he said Merry Christmas we're all doing it to make fun of how he made a point of saying

1972
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,880
The anchor said

1973
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,904
I love how you say that

1974
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:25,024
You're making fun of that because Fox News have maybe we aren't allowed to say Merry Christmas thing

1975
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,840
Talking point in the last few years

1976
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,888
So kind of makes it look like a wink

1977
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:35,008
But he's making fun of that less actually offended that any

1978
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
Wait so he's going on Fox

1979
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
And friends and selling his bully who's Fox

1980
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:43,456
Confetti was on Fox News

1981
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
So

1982
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,064
Alex

1983
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Is memory

1984
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Money talks about

1985
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Noah

1986
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Use the inaugural

1987
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,024
He was a hero

1988
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
On that day

1989
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
I really don't remember him being

1990
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,352
That day was war

1991
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
What do you understand me

1992
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,032
Which war the Civil War the war on Christmas or the war between Vermont and Connecticut was a lease permission

1993
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,568
The Connecticut War on Christmas

1994
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
At the inauguration

1995
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
Paragon connect

1996
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,920
Alright the story is not

1997
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,736
You know I was just having flashbacks to

1998
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
3 years and 3 months ago

1999
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,112
4 years ago

2000
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:24,928
January 2017 and they had a big

2001
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,232
Steel fence around the whole Mall

2002
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,048
8 a.m.

2003
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
And

2004
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,912
I didn't check where the VIP Everett was the ticket

2005
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,800
I just want to walk the mall

2006
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,480
Families with children video

2007
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:55,648
Ran over a mob of them in the police ran over and arrest us

2008
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,976
Scream out of my shed

2009
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,792
But shame on you

2010
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
Hero

2011
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:08,448
The very top one in there with all the

2012
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,984
Eddyville wasn't there

2013
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,544
Agreements with the police where they could be

2014
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,408
For the federal police

2015
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,200
Just like in the documents we got

2016
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:24,320
Front porch

2017
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,904
Police that they're allowed to commit the crime certain areas

2018
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696
It's all staged

2019
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,744
And I just got so angry

2020
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,048
Cuz it took me hours to get in

2021
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
And ice

2022
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,008
They were all nice and there was no line that you just walk through

2023
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:49,920
The American people are being Sat On by the DC police in League with the antifa

2024
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,968
North Korea

2025
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:58,368
These people are dangerous we cannot let them get control the country

2026
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,184
Suggest the police are in cahoots

2027
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,208
It's stories.

2028
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,280
Through it all exaggerated version of the

2029
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,328
The version of that story I've heard him telling

2030
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,680
It's all just to confirm with the fakes

2031
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:17,056
Soros antifa contracts that he found a match

2032
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
Is false

2033
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:22,432
Documents the story like that that makes me worry if at the end of this

2034
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,968
We both go inside

2035
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
Because

2036
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,552
That is the least real thing

2037
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,856
That I think I've ever heard from anybody

2038
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
He's just

2039
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,744
You just gaslighted me so hard I'm like listening to this

2040
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,304
Using that like part of my my

2041
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,120
Bring this like well you should listen to human beings York

2042
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:47,776
Person that because you would act trustworthy so you can assume that they would act trustworthy towards you

2043
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,800
And it's just such a lie

2044
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:55,200
It's just not real it's a fundamental flaw of the shows

2045
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,064
You should I don't know I think I've gone insane

2046
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,368
So I think there's a good chance

2047
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,928
We're in the clear but so far I mean

2048
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:11,328
Man 3 years 3 years time it might say a code word

2049
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:15,424
3 years has hard time I know but I mean when you're looking at

2050
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:20,800
You know a dime maybe maybe your 7 is when you can go crazy would be so if you're rich

2051
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,384
So Alex gets back on the phone we've already had one guy who's

2052
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
Blackheads

2053
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,712
One of the most f*****-up calls I've heard on his show ever

2054
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:33,856
And he's very flippant and just nonchalant about starting the second Civil War then he

2055
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,136
You get the caller who's got a

2056
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,952
Right he's talking in this

2057
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,232
Is brogue

2058
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,792
Yeah and then

2059
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Parabolic

2060
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,864
I'm like this guy's doing fake

2061
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,656
Yeah and the middle of it

2062
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,984
To his real voice

2063
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
Like you know

2064
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,800
How I sounded like I was Scottish

2065
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,384
But I'm not that's like the impeachment

2066
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,248
Sounds like

2067
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:07,648
Yeah go to bed comedian I do Impressions like I was on America's Got Talent and

2068
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,144
I wanted to play all of it

2069
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,728
Yeah babe get these places that was in the small town and

2070
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:26,592
No they wouldn't let me perform and not like

2071
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:32,992
Wow and then I got hired by SNL and I don't want to talk about that anymore

2072
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:36,064
Play all of it but it's way too long and just playing a tiny piece of

2073
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,344
Wouldn't do it justice

2074
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,904
Suffice it to say guy doesn't fix Scottish accent

2075
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
Says he's a comedian and then Alex offers

2076
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
Okay so that's

2077
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:47,840
Great that sounds like exactly how that would work yeah it was very surreal

2078
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:54,240
This guy sounds a little bit like fat bastard so I got to let him do the fourth hour from now on that's just

2079
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,336
Videoshow

2080
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,176
So I would get another caller who does

2081
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,200
That's it

2082
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,224
Plug Broward

2083
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
What is product

2084
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:05,760
Very excite

2085
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,552
But then he has a pitch

2086
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,088
Beretta shirt

2087
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,136
That I think would be important

2088
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
My God

2089
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,720
You have changed my life turboforce has

2090
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
Is changed my life

2091
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,072
I was raped in 2016

2092
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,864
Largely in part because of you

2093
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,168
About a year ago

2094
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,192
He got body

2095
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,752
Super silver super silver for your teeth

2096
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
Rachel + red pill

2097
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
You changed my life

2098
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,920
What I really want to say first off

2099
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,944
I'm an artist

2100
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,992
I was born and raised in the Kansas City area

2101
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,808
But I moved to Northern California in 2011

2102
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,392
I've been social-networking since 1987

2103
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,208
And the information Warfare is exactly

2104
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
Where we need to be

2105
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,560
I had an idea for a t-shirt which is why I called

2106
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,400
It would show it would be picture of Anne Frank

2107
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,936
Olean AR

2108
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,240
Or another kind of gun

2109
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
And the caption would say

2110
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:00,800
Anne Frank

2111
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,824
Needed a gun

2112
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
Hijacked our women

2113
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
We need women

2114
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:10,528
To totally agree we need women to identify with being strong and empowered and not

2115
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,088
Slaves the global Insight or like that's a great idea

2116
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:15,392
And Frank need a gun on the front

2117
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,464
Don't let dictator take your guns

2118
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
And

2119
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:24,352
You're absolutely right that's a great idea sir that's a great idea

2120
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:28,704
Holyshit yeah I did not know Banksy wasn't in for it

2121
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:36,128
I would just I can't imagine how poorly that shirt would go over there's just no you just can't parody

2122
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:39,200
You just can't they're just better at it

2123
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,992
They're better at parroting themselves

2124
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,528
Then I could ever I would never even

2125
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,624
Consider that can't put a hat on a hat driver would never consider that

2126
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,904
That's bananas

2127
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,976
So we we have one last clip your from the 19th

2128
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,512
But it's Alex talking about how you

2129
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Tell Dima

2130
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,864
You can pick them out of a crowd

2131
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,424
That's by their eyes designer shirts

2132
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,728
With Frank holding a gun

2133
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,824
And then Alex starts wandering and giving a

2134
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,128
Biblical justification

2135
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
For killing people who are demons

2136
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Is that right

2137
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,736
Right which isn't good

2138
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,528
Given the prior context of everything

2139
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:20,416
Then if you look at these Global if they always have that look in their eyes like they're winning or so powerful

2140
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:23,488
They're enjoying it those are haughty eyes and men have them too

2141
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,816
People always have those eyes

2142
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,376
Like they're going to get you it's funny

2143
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,984
Absolutely

2144
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,080
Hebrew

2145
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,640
Blood

2146
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,688
Killing people

2147
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,968
That didn't attack you

2148
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
Killing people that didn't mean

2149
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:51,904
Killing

2150
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,720
Human Sacrifice I want them all dead

2151
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,488
Killem

2152
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,048
And I'm not saying God for killing people

2153
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
The Bible says

2154
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,144
Flower

2155
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,424
The Bible

2156
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,960
Holyshit

2157
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:11,360
You know it's the people most likely to carry around a Bible in their pocket who are least likely to have read the f****** bottle

2158
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:18,272
I don't think you can have any less responsible thing you could say on are then I'm not saying you should go around killing people

2159
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,576
I'm just telling you what the Bible says

2160
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,648
I think you have entered in

2161
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,184
Into witty

2162
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,976
Bad territory

2163
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:27,744
Jesus

2164
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,096
The show wraps up on the 9th

2165
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
I felt like

2166
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,496
That's exactly kind of what I expected but actually Morris

2167
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,800
Extreme

2168
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,568
Response theme

2169
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,872
Like I knew that he wasn't going to be

2170
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,408
He caught like on his heels

2171
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:50,528
Off-balance but surprised

2172
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,088
I wasn't prepared for first of all

2173
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,880
The angle that he has

2174
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
To be so weak

2175
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,744
Like the plans that the globalist had me so dumb

2176
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,536
So poorly thought-through

2177
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,072
It's so we're just almost

2178
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
Winning it

2179
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:08,704
It doesn't it doesn't indicate to me in any way that he sat down and thought like alright what are we going to do

2180
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,288
Nothing like the Democrats in the globalist

2181
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:17,408
Evil plans have a loose improvisational feel to them almost

2182
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:21,248
I would have expected a Keno's that the impeachment was going to happen

2183
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,296
At some point

2184
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
For a while

2185
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,136
Yeah get your goddamn writers room together

2186
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,416
And have them come up with

2187
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,440
Something inspire

2188
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,512
They just hired his first writer

2189
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,792
Scottish

2190
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,352
Yeah and I did I did

2191
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
Expect there to be some sort of a

2192
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,424
Extreme

2193
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
Violin

2194
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,776
Undertone expected to be nearly that

2195
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,056
Over that

2196
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,360
That's f***** up but it does

2197
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,408
Track with the disorder Verizon

2198
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,968
Temperature of the show over the last couple

2199
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,528
There has been a far more consistent

2200
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,088
Discussion of the Time to Kill

2201
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,136
When is killing okay

2202
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
Who should we kill

2203
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,512
It does seem like that conversation is normalizing

2204
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
Very much

2205
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
Tututix not that it was not

2206
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,400
A while back

2207
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:12,192
I think it's something to keep an eye on

2208
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,984
Anyway Alex gets in

2209
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
And look dude

2210
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,848
Okay then I just been trying to pee

2211
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,616
Peach Trump

2212
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,896
Pence is also on the

2213
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:23,712
On The Chopping Block

2214
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
Okay

2215
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:28,832
So it's now all happening this broke this morning

2216
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
And

2217
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,928
Open up article from flashback

2218
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,976
January 2000

2219
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
19

2220
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,048
11 months ago

2221
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:41,376
We're not going to show those articles. More

2222
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,192
I'm going to go to rebroadcast for wild snowbigdeal

2223
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:48,288
Because I need to get prepared for this and imma go with terminal

2224
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,080
And I'm going to pull

2225
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,640
Eclipse from 2017

2226
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,944
Clemson 2018

2227
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,736
Rodger Stone

2228
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,784
Specifically

2229
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:06,464
Laid out here on are exactly how they would trigger all of this how did you not do this pre-show

2230
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,512
How did how little

2231
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,536
Do you care

2232
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:13,888
They're like I'm going to start the show and then within a minute within 2 minutes

2233
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:21,312
I'm going to rebroadcast cuz I got to actually do prep I got to find those articles my staff can't do it they're not finding the right art

2234
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
Articles nothing he does nothing

2235
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Prepare for this

2236
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,432
I will just talk

2237
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,784
He has the easiest job

2238
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,856
Yeah and he's still f***** it up

2239
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
That's amazing

2240
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
Quite his his ability to fail

2241
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,000
Is incredible

2242
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Yeah

2243
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:44,096
So anyway the plants 2D pants

2244
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,400
But then Pelosi gets in office

2245
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
Then what

2246
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:52,032
Pelosi president

2247
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,336
Infowars.com

2248
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,360
We told you that

2249
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
100

2250
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,248
I don't think of the president he's removed

2251
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,576
Pelosi then who's ready to run for office

2252
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:09,952
Democratic party wedding promoter convention

2253
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:14,560
She becomes the first woman president

2254
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:19,424
Hillary Rodham Clinton is in it's all set up it's all prepared we told you 2 years ago

2255
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
With Cotto

2256
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
Crustacean

2257
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,008
We're getting the clips

2258
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,568
Total precision

2259
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,848
Alright whatever

2260
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:32,224
Anyway that wasn't the plan according to you yesterday but whatever anybody

2261
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,760
More wrong

2262
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,856
Then somebody who thinks it'll literally total precision

2263
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
Is that what you're talkin about I'm boggled

2264
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,952
I'm boggled

2265
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,232
So

2266
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,280
Alex is waiting for those clips

2267
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:48,352
Prison turns to find them who doesn't actually go off air

2268
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,376
To do that at work

2269
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,912
You failed to do before the show

2270
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,472
But you know just messing around

2271
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Sites to get

2272
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Real

2273
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,568
F****** xenophobic

2274
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,896
Bucket white nationalist

2275
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:03,456
So here's the beginning

2276
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,760
Really they're just a salting

2277
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
Reality

2278
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:15,744
And then having you and reports out saying we're going to replace Europe with Muslims and the us we want 600 million

2279
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,584
Brought in the next 30 Years the Us official un policy

2280
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,912
2001

2281
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,216
Right here

2282
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
The ATL says

2283
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
They're lying in the

2284
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:32,128
Upcoming UK elections is a month ago

2285
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,920
They're saying that

2286
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,528
There's a thing called replacement migration to

2287
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,552
Get rid of

2288
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:43,136
Muslims they specifically say

2289
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:45,952
Middle Eastern Muslims and North

2290
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:49,536
African Muslims patible with each other

2291
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,608
Do they don't want any Christian mugs Christian Africa

2292
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,656
They don't want any

2293
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,264
Nature worship

2294
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
Dieter

2295
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,592
Does the Muslim kill them

2296
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,432
We're going to have Muslims they're the ones that are compatible

2297
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:10,016
Because there was an Austrian Hungarian Prince

2298
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,040
Pull it up

2299
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,648
That whole plant 100 years ago he's the guy that invented the modern Olympics

2300
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,184
To bring in Muslim

2301
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,048
Napoleon

2302
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:25,120
Started the Islam had a plan to bring the Muslims into Europe

2303
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,912
At 2

2304
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,544
Because they were more Muslims than there were Christians in Europe then to you could take over

2305
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,848
They're one group that acts as one

2306
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,688
But Sacha Baron Cohen

2307
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,248
As already

2308
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,528
Cast the dice

2309
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,648
The ATL doubt literally

2310
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,720
Is it Islamic organization

2311
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:51,744
Whatever

2312
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,304
Alex isn't totally lying

2313
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,704
Inasmuch as the UN did release a report in 2001 called replacement migration is it a solution to declining in

2314
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,728
An aging population

2315
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:06,848
The problem as it always is if Alex is that he doesn't understand what he didn't read

2316
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,944
Executive summary of the document Begins by explaining that the report will layouts

2317
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,760
6 possible scenarios they see as possibilities

2318
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,064
Based on the current population Trends in France

2319
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,088
Germany Italy

2320
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,672
Japan Republic of Korea the Russian Federation the United Kingdom

2321
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,440
And United States

2322
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:25,536
These scenarios were differentiated by Computing different levels of migration

2323
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,560
How it would affect the

2324
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,376
Specifically in terms of population

2325
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,680
And the report is very clear saying quote

2326
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:35,264
These are not meant to be recommendations in any way but illustrations

2327
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,800
Hypothetical scenarios

2328
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:41,408
Alex takes all his numbers about you and recommendations for immigrants from

2329
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,736
Because that's the one where the numbers were the highest

2330
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:50,112
That was their scenario of how many immigrants would be needed to keep the ratio of people aged 15

2331
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,648
64 the work

2332
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:56,256
Forced the ratio of them to people 65 or older

2333
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
The highest possible rate

2334
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
That it would have been

2335
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:02,400
Again the report is clear about what is

2336
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,424
It is

2337
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
Quote

2338
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,312
Readers should keep in mind that the results of scenario 6 are for illustrative purposes only

2339
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:13,408
Given the Assumption the current age structure of the population would remain unchanged

2340
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
Future

2341
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,224
The resulting large number of migrants

2342
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
Needed should be considered totally unrealistic

2343
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,576
Says that in the document

2344
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,880
In the discussion section it's

2345
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,928
Discuss how unfeasible this scenario is

2346
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,208
Literally saying quote

2347
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,512
This scenario is clearly not realistic

2348
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,840
Therefore immigration cannot prevent aging of the population

2349
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,656
The conclusion offered in the report is it

2350
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,728
Exactly the opposite of Alex what Alex would have you believe

2351
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,520
Also I would love to

2352
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
To see how Alex

2353
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,080
Explains that the number of immigrants

2354
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,360
Needed in scenario 6

2355
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:48,224
Is five times higher for the Republic of Korea than it is for all of Europe

2356
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,296
I thought he was saying that this is all about flooding the Westwood

2357
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,904
But I bet if you presented with a spoon of the sort of rebuttal you just say that

2358
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:56,672
Huriya is

2359
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,952
Yeah sure why not

2360
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,024
Immigration North Korea is the east

2361
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:06,656
South Korea is the West didn't you remember the Korean War that's where the Patriots 10K

2362
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:13,056
Immigration is one part of the report but it's really about much more and as to do with aspects of the question of the changing age.

2363
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,336
Distribution in population

2364
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:20,992
They bring up issues about how the ratio of worker to retirees is affected by the age of retirement

2365
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:21,760
And Country

2366
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,320
The level the level of labor force participation

2367
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,344
Change that.

2368
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:29,696
And how the problems are of a higher rate of retirees to workers

2369
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:35,584
Can be offset by increased contributions from workers into programs designed to help the elderly those swords

2370
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,656
Solve all sorts of problems

2371
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,424
On the Run

2372
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:46,336
Airport is much much larger than what Alex presents but that's because he doesn't care about the wait what the UN is actually doing or study

2373
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
We're looking at

2374
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,384
You just want you to know

2375
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,664
They want to bring in most

2376
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,712
It's because they want to conquer you

2377
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,992
And the best way to do that is

2378
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,016
Bring again Muslim

2379
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,112
This is on the one hand a horrible mishandling of his Swordsman

2380
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,184
It shows that he has no grasp ignore any interest in

2381
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,720
The actual issues that he's cover

2382
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:07,584
More importantly on the other hand it shows a deeply internalized islamophobia

2383
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,424
That's so far past the point of acceptability I don't even really know how to address it

2384
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:14,496
If Alex thinks that Muslims all act as one

2385
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:18,080
Then I don't know what to say about it except to say he's a

2386
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,920
He's turning a minority group into a unified block

2387
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:24,224
Which only makes his audience fear and hate the

2388
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
Individuals can

2389
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,784
Pain in that group more

2390
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,320
They're no longer individual

2391
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:33,440
They're mindless parts of a unified block that only exists in this country because the UN is using them

2392
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,208
Concord

2393
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,256
That kind of thinking is repulsive

2394
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,328
And I really feel like that's pretty good demonstration valances

2395
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,120
Horrible white identity leanings

2396
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,144
And xenophobia

2397
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,192
To drive this point home

2398
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:48,032
I read the UN report and the words Muslim and Islam don't appear anywhere in the

2399
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:54,688
Sure of course not that would it would be eat it would be too easy if they did one plate I would typically releases

2400
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,992
Instead

2401
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,528
Good God.

2402
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,624
Alex is just a f*** you to me person

2403
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
Alex Azar

2404
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:06,464
So mad that it's not even mention

2405
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,512
You don't even have the f******

2406
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:12,096
Time to look for one spot where it might be measured that

2407
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,168
Also the founder of modern Olympics

2408
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:21,568
This is not an austro-hungarian print it was Pierre de coubertin French historian and philosopher so

2409
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
I'm pretty sure Alex is just make

2410
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,152
You shut up that he read on some dumb dumb right now

2411
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,200
Man that is

2412
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:27,968
Unreal

2413
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
That is just

2414
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
Unreal

2415
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,296
Totally and it gets worse

2416
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,088
Because a caller calls in

2417
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,880
And wants to bring up another

2418
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,160
Pretty xenophobic

2419
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:39,488
Narrative about the death of Katie Kate steinle

2420
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,328
Which is the woman who was shot by a bullet ricocheted

2421
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,400
Accidentally fired by undocumented immigrant

2422
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:48,192
We talked about that case quite a bit

2423
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,984
I wouldn't actually even

2424
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
Include this clip

2425
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
It would be background

2426
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,080
If it weren't for how Alex

2427
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Tells this story

2428
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,152
He adds

2429
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,712
So many details to this story

2430
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:03,040
That I've not heard him even report before and Arkham

2431
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,320
Wheatley made of

2432
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:09,952
Trump at a chance a long time ago.

2433
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,768
Insurgency Act

2434
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,560
Shut up.

2435
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,728
41 was shot to death and what did they do they allowed Sanctuary cities

2436
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,896
Well you're a Mexican

2437
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:35,296
You've been deported five times you're allowed to murder and they said he's a victim and now he's suing the jail where he was held

2438
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:38,880
The back for fun

2439
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,672
How does that say

2440
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:44,512
Does that make you feel in America

2441
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:49,632
You don't want anybody because you just shoot a young woman in the back for no reason

2442
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,216
Because she was beautiful

2443
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:57,312
What

2444
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,616
Is there a lot of people jealous of beautiful women

2445
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,176
Gorgeous

2446
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,200
Beautiful

2447
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:08,320
And he killed her because he was pissed and jealous and thought that that was his her older

2448
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,392
Boyfriend with her dad hugging her

2449
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:14,720
They were crying and talking about family members that have just died

2450
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,536
I saw that body song

2451
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:22,144
This clip is a serious

2452
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,424
Serious problem

2453
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:27,264
But one as we discussed in previous episodes Kate steinle death is he

2454
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,032
Tragic event

2455
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,848
I am not in any way taking away from that

2456
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,872
But it was an Autumn

2457
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:38,784
A judge acquitted Jose Yanez garcia-zarate of first-degree murder second-degree murder involuntary

2458
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
Manslaughter

2459
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,576
And even assault with the

2460
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:42,112
Semi-automatic firearm

2461
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,672
Because it was clear that you did not mean to fire the bullet

2462
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
It ricocheted

2463
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
And then hits.

2464
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:49,280
He was charged with being a felon in possession of

2465
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:52,352
The firearm but that conviction was overturned by the court of appeals

2466
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:54,912
Because the previous Jerry was not instructed properly

2467
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,192
About what constitutes

2468
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,728
Being in possession of a gun

2469
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,776
Garcia Zarate found

2470
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,312
Gun that was wrapped in rags

2471
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,104
What you picked up not knowing it was a gun

2472
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,896
In the process the gunfire

2473
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,944
This is an example of a horrible tragedy

2474
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:10,528
And I've nothing but a thief or the steinle family and what they've had to go through

2475
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:16,928
That being said the way the right-wing media has used this case is indicative of a very extreme hostility towards him

2476
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:23,072
There's no evidence that garcia-zarate was a possession of the gun let alone that he intended to shoot a wall

2477
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,376
Knowing that the bullet would bounce off in Hit

2478
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,144
Dying Light

2479
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,448
And yet this has been the rally in case

2480
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,776
Brezina phobic assholes like Alex and everyone at Infowars

2481
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:35,616
And I think this clip is Alex letting it slip a little bit too much

2482
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,640
As to why

2483
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:42,016
The stuff about garcia-zarate killing steinle because she was beautiful is completely made

2484
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:46,112
The idea that he thought that her father was her older boyfriend and he couldn't stand

2485
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:48,672
The jealousy is absolutely not based on anything

2486
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:52,512
Real but it does rely on pretty standard white-supremacist ropes

2487
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:55,328
About knowing

2488
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:59,168
What Alex is doing this clip is legitimately no different from

2489
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,192
From pro-segregation

2490
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,776
Propaganda about black men having uncontrollable lust for white women

2491
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:06,592
But it would act out violently if not kept in their place

2492
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:08,128
Yep without you

2493
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:09,408
Too far out back off

2494
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
Under this roof

2495
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:12,736
Alex's pretending that he's reporting FAQ

2496
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:15,296
But literally all this is him talking about his

2497
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,064
Feeling

2498
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,832
His feelings

2499
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,112
Are f****** racist

2500
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:25,024
He feels like garcia-zarate killed steinle because she was beautiful and a white woman he was jealous that he couldn't be with her

2501
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,048
But that

2502
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,072
All that is

2503
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,608
Alex is feeling

2504
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,912
He's making that up because he believed

2505
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,216
Do you believe that because it fits

2506
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,496
Internalized racism

2507
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,032
Is it feel his head

2508
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,080
Thank you presenting it to his audience

2509
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,360
Sfac

2510
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,408
Yeah no

2511
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,432
And it is not

2512
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,480
I mean

2513
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,504
If that was

2514
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,784
Anybody

2515
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:49,344
With even a little bit more power

2516
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,880
They worded that

2517
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,416
That clear lawsuit

2518
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:58,816
That's not even a little bit

2519
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:03,680
Absolutely going after Hammerhead he doesn't have the brains or ability to go after them

2520
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:08,288
Put Power inside I think you still might have a case

2521
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:12,384
That's what I'm saying no they know they know or at least he should buy now

2522
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,176
That that is clearly

2523
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,456
Actionable legal

2524
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,736
But there

2525
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,296
Boy it's a good Target if you

2526
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:23,136
Recognize how much money it cost to do anything in the judicial

2527
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,416
Bright because

2528
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,184
That is

2529
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,976
There's no way that that's not

2530
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,512
That's

2531
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,816
He just told this bulshit story

2532
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,352
About this guy

2533
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,400
Turning him into the

2534
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,168
F******

2535
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:37,472
Raving lunatic

2536
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,264
Immigrants who can't

2537
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,664
Control himself around to a beautiful white woman is there on Thursdays though transformed

2538
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,712
No way that's not defamation

2539
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
That's my sense of it again

2540
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:54,368
Not as a lawyer Point yeah

2541
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,904
He has every reason to no it's not

2542
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,208
That's just f***** up

2543
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:59,488
That's just f***** up

2544
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:03,840
Yeah that should be that dude deserves all about I've never heard

2545
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,608
That

2546
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:09,216
Version of this told and the way Alex is telling it is so full of like

2547
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,752
Feeling

2548
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,800
All the stuff we heard on the previous day or it's just

2549
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,896
Wrote Going Through the Motions of this is a globalist plan

2550
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,176
Beallsville

2551
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:21,248
Yeah I know that's that this person

2552
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,528
Sun was lusting for Kate

2553
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,296
Steinle

2554
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:25,344
And had to kill her that's so much

2555
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,136
That's so much the f******

2556
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:33,024
And to sort of like this is what we do and this is what I love

2557
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:33,792
Send it.

2558
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,816
That just do

2559
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,096
That f******

2560
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,888
Jim Crow era

2561
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,704
We have to do this and here is why

2562
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,472
Because

2563
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,544
Imagine your daughter being around a black man

2564
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
It has the same

2565
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,360
You don't want that to happen

2566
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:51,968
It relies on that tradition very heavily and I don't believe that Alex's

2567
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,296
And some way aware that that's what he's doing

2568
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
So

2569
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
Alex gets to

2570
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:00,672
I made this club I just Captain maybe as a palico

2571
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,720
Cleanser because it's another one of these indication

2572
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:03,488
Receive

2573
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,768
Over and over again of

2574
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,048
Just like such

2575
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:26,272
When it's completely fake but it does seem like he's enjoying that

2576
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:34,976
Just faking it you know in the same way is over the saxophone

2577
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:39,072
Belong To The City earlier

2578
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,376
Seems to have a good time when he's being a racist

2579
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,400
And when

2580
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,424
He is yelling

2581
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:49,824
In and out of breaks the only times he has a good time or when

2582
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,848
When he's singing

2583
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,152
Drinking and being a racist

2584
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
Now that's a good text

2585
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:58,784
Expose don't say that

2586
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,808
I know I'm just

2587
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:06,464
So do you know what I don't do assume that every single texting is exactly the same and functions as

2588
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:10,048
Is one single block and that's why we have no problem with the UN killing them

2589
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:12,352
Goodonya I'm very brave

2590
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,632
So Alex gets

2591
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400
Call

2592
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,168
On this

2593
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,960
Episode from a guy named range

2594
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:23,872
And he apparently had to do believe you was on a boat at one time

2595
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:26,688
Unlock Galaxy did not give it up to

2596
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:28,992
No

2597
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,272
This is interesting because

2598
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,552
I think he's right here

2599
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,856
Metaphor about what

2600
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:34,880
Needs to do

2601
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,696
Security

2602
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:41,280
We were working on a boat one time a large vessel that was actually

2603
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:46,144
Pirates Cay

2604
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,192
Generally don't have a boat suitable fast

2605
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:54,080
When that didn't happen the captain put the boat on lockdown that everybody went to their cabins and lock the door

2606
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
Room-to-room

2607
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,920
Clearing the boat out

2608
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,968
Maybe it's time that

2609
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,248
The president looks

2610
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:03,296
Country on lockdown

2611
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:06,112
Analogy

2612
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,648
I can't imagine

2613
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,720
Thinking like listening to Alex's show and imagining

2614
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,000
Scenario where

2615
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:14,816
A caller would call in and say hey you know what I think

2616
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,608
Executive needs to

2617
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:22,752
Unilaterally put the country into his strict lockdown much like you have pirates on a boat and got to clear it door to door

2618
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,800
How could you even possibly

2619
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,336
We can see that that would be

2620
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,896
An acceptable line of conversation

2621
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:32,480
On the show it's so far afield of what he pretends

2622
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:35,552
To be about or pretended to be about yeah I know that

2623
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,856
That is that is genuinely

2624
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,648
That is I mean

2625
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:42,208
That's genuinely everything that you've ever fought again

2626
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,768
Everything literally

2627
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:46,560
Part of the f******

2628
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:49,888
God damn Constitution is that we can't

2629
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:56,288
You think they can't force us out the corner people

2630
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,312
F****** country

2631
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,592
Started

2632
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,896
Because somebody did that

2633
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:07,552
Lot of reasons

2634
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,344
I'm saying

2635
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:15,744
Part of the idea is always at the Constitution

2636
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,536
The Revolutionary War is amazing

2637
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,840
And literally they're doing stuff

2638
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,632
That the founding fathers were like

2639
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:26,496
Let's make sure this never happens

2640
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288
That's insane

2641
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:31,360
Which doesn't just say that's a great analogy

2642
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,640
Doubles down

2643
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:39,040
Pirates they're not Americans

2644
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:01,056
Alex wants to record it to put out as its own Standalone video this guy saying

2645
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:04,384
Calling in and saying the Trump needs to clear the ship

2646
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,920
From Pirates

2647
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,200
He does not do a good job

2648
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,480
When they come back

2649
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:14,368
Take does he also record play like a clip from him

2650
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,136
You know like

2651
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,952
They 2015 are saying that

2652
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:23,584
The president is a dictator and a tyrant who is trying to lock people down and go

2653
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,888
Door-to-door taking their guns

2654
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,704
Did he put those two back back-to-back and show that

2655
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,240
He's ideologically

2656
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:31,008
Find

2657
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,288
No

2658
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,128
Examination the fight against the globalist

2659
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,920
2 strong

2660
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,456
Take too much time

2661
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,224
He said that

2662
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:46,624
He said that Obama was going to go door-to-door make everybody stay inside

2663
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,952
He was a tyrant

2664
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,000
Going to take the globalist gun

2665
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,072
Oh I didn't realize that take a globalist

2666
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,096
Man

2667
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
You can tell the globalist

2668
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,656
Because I didn't possess

2669
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:00,448
See you there

2670
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,240
Anyway Alex

2671
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,288
You know he doesn't get the clean take he's looking

2672
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,056
4 but he

2673
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,592
He does offer

2674
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
The exact

2675
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,920
Excuse

2676
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,224
You would expect from a crypto-fascist

2677
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:14,784
For why you need to enact fashion

2678
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,648
All out

2679
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:23,744
How you did Security on a ship that I forgot boarded by Pirates

2680
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,048
And what the captain did that emergency

2681
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,096
Martial law

2682
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:31,680
I don't want Civil War the globalists are putting

2683
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:37,824
He made us do it is not it's only one martial law

2684
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,616
So yeah

2685
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,384
Stupid s***

2686
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:46,272
Operating theory is that these guys would rather destroy

2687
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,296
America then

2688
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,832
Share it with not white

2689
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,624
Who Woulda thought

2690
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,160
Who Woulda thought

2691
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:53,440
That a group

2692
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,720
Look for decades

2693
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:56,000
Is Ben

2694
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,792
Primarily anti-government

2695
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:00,352
Yeah I would do I just stay over all of a sudden

2696
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:03,168
We are super into this most government

2697
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:07,776
We would like the most government we would like it to crack down on us

2698
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:09,824
When I say us

2699
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,872
It makes it makes you think that maybe

2700
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,152
Just maybe

2701
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:16,992
Anti-human

2702
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,272
Holloman

2703
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,064
So Christianity Today

2704
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,928
Publication came out in support of removing Trump

2705
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,976
This caused a little bit of

2706
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:33,376
There is not a crisis but Alex now hates Christianity Today

2707
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:36,448
Hard as real short walk to get there

2708
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:40,800
Caller who actually Alex might not have brought it up at all if this caller doesn't bring

2709
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,080
I didn't bring it to the table

2710
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,152
That look

2711
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,176
The way they're covering

2712
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:50,016
The story breaking news

2713
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:56,928
It's been coming out the Trump has had a love child with one of his

2714
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:58,208
Closest friends

2715
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,488
Teammates

2716
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:02,816
And that he was worried about that coming out

2717
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:06,144
And he actually he actually had him killed

2718
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,496
Of course I'm joking ok

2719
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,776
But hear me out

2720
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,848
As much as a shock is that was the here

2721
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:17,664
And I'm sure everybody was shocked by it

2722
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,272
I'm calling out Christians today

2723
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:23,808
Because

2724
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:28,160
Christians will wave the flag of Christianity and

2725
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,696
By the way

2726
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,488
But Christians will will

2727
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,560
Say that David was a man after God's Own Heart

2728
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:38,400
But I see the hypocrisy that's happening now again

2729
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,936
Christians

2730
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,984
That are not standing with their

2731
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,264
With our president

2732
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,800
With their leader

2733
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:49,408
Whether you like him or not the Bible says that we are to pray for our leaders

2734
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,200
If you like him or not

2735
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
Today

2736
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:54,016
Top of drugs

2737
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:58,368
Christianity Today comes out calling for the removal of

2738
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,392
Donald Trump

2739
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,184
He should be out there I think.

2740
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,976
Completely disgusting

2741
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:09,376
Whether you like them or not you pray for your leaders unless his name is Barack Obama

2742
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:11,936
Hey Dan Dan whether you like him or not

2743
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:17,824
You just admit whether you like them or not you pray for him unless you are there Democrats

2744
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:20,896
This is such b*******

2745
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,712
Really dumb for a number of reasons the first is that

2746
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:24,992
David repent

2747
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:27,552
That's a big part of the story

2748
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,696
But he's just s***

2749
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,720
Such such

2750
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,256
Dumb.

2751
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:39,840
But it's so indicative of like a you-know-what last week

2752
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:43,680
Love Christian Dior

2753
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:47,008
Nothing means anything

2754
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,288
Yeah that is

2755
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,848
Different l

2756
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,920
You are now devilettes bananas

2757
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,688
Take that

2758
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,224
You're going

2759
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,248
It's very much

2760
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,808
I don't like you know what I'm saying

2761
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,832
I think a lot of these

2762
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,112
Christian people

2763
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:05,184
Don't really particularly care about what's in the Bible

2764
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:10,816
Don't feel that way they just want to use that book to justify the things they already wanted to do

2765
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,632
So Alex

2766
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,960
He's been saying along the throughout this

2767
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,752
December 20th episode that

2768
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,800
The Supreme Court has ruled that

2769
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,336
Pelosi can't do what she

2770
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,640
She's doing by withholding the impeach

2771
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,176
Indictment

2772
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,456
Going-to-the-Sun

2773
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,784
I had no idea what he was talking about I was waiting for him to get to it

2774
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:33,344
He never did quite a bit down the line

2775
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,904
I'm in eat you for that in

2776
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,928
With his

2777
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,464
Ideas about like

2778
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,256
Hey public so dumb they think

2779
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,024
Impeachment is

2780
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,304
Conviction

2781
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,072
And all that

2782
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,376
They do though

2783
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,936
I think in the same way you could do a man on the street

2784
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:50,496
Free videos

2785
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:56,128
A higher percentage than we would like to think do that

2786
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:58,176
Yeah but I would also bet

2787
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,200
The third like

2788
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:01,504
Lo lo engaged

2789
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,808
With the news kind of think they're like

2790
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:06,624
Not like stupid

2791
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,904
Very likely but

2792
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,696
I don't particularly care

2793
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:16,352
About them as people that's not something

2794
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,120
Yeah

2795
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,656
I would respond to that

2796
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:20,192
Sort of thing by Zayn

2797
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:26,592
Yes education needs to be better that's about it that's

2798
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,128
I Gotta Feeling

2799
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,432
I don't

2800
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:31,200
Really no

2801
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,480
This is.

2802
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:38,880
I'm somewhat inform so are you and she thinks everybody knows the house is just impeachment I just an indictment

2803
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:43,488
Infowars.com

2804
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:46,304
Questionnaire

2805
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,520
Bet you can't do what blows he did

2806
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,640
They can't demand rules be changed

2807
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:04,736
Or

2808
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:12,416
They don't care because it's a ruthless

2809
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:16,256
Supreme Court ruling on Pelosi

2810
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,792
Impeachment demands

2811
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:23,168
The framers did not intend to impose additional limitations on the form of the Senate proceedings

2812
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:26,496
The Supreme Court stated in Nixon vs United States

2813
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:31,872
The fact that you cannot have the house

2814
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:37,248
Telling the Senate what they can do

2815
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,808
Supreme Court ruled in that in a federal

2816
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,136
They got through at the Supreme Court

2817
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:50,304
The whole article but people need

2818
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:58,240
Don't worry I'm not going to read the whole article and Alex Jones story

2819
02:12:58,496 --> 02:12:59,264
Pelosi cannot

2820
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,800
Hold up delivering the impeachment

2821
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:05,152
Based on a flawed reading of the 1993 Supreme Court decision Nixon versus

2822
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:06,176
United States

2823
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:10,784
That case had nothing to do with the situation where it now but it does include that one sentence

2824
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,808
Somehow

2825
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:14,624
Still employed Infowars kid videos

2826
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,904
Used as a hinge

2827
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
To make it sound relative

2828
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:23,328
The quote the framers did not intend to impose additional limitations on the form of the Senate proceedings

2829
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,144
Alex right at the Cornerstone of

2830
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,680
The article on Infowars

2831
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:31,776
Out of context that kind of appears to be saying that the Senate gets to decide every

2832
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:36,128
But really in regards to this specific complaint being heard it doesn't really

2833
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,920
What is it with you and this

2834
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:42,016
It's always like you should run understand things within the context

2835
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:45,344
Sandwich they were sick and then they

2836
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,624
The time. That's also

2837
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:50,208
Damn it there's so much contact What If instead

2838
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:54,304
I told you just don't believe whatever you wanted to believe

2839
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:57,632
In this case a judge named Walter Nixon who'd been in

2840
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:00,448
Sue to have a salary reinstated because he believed

2841
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:01,472
Senate rules

2842
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,520
11 had been broken by

2843
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,312
Buried itself out

2844
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,848
In the impeachment process

2845
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,920
His argument was rejected in the Supreme Court held that

2846
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:12,480
Did the framers really were only requiring

2847
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,272
That the Senators be under oath

2848
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,576
The two-thirds vote for conviction to pass

2849
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:19,136
And that the Chief Justice presided over the case

2850
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:21,696
When it's the president

2851
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,488
It's not required in other MP

2852
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,280
Yeah just in case

2853
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,048
Is the presidential Inn

2854
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,352
That's so funny that a judge who is

2855
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,120
Impeached

2856
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:32,448
Came up with a flawed legal

2857
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,240
Other than these three things

2858
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:37,568
The framers did not intend to impose additional limitations on the farm

2859
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:41,152
This legitimately has nothing to do with how and it beats

2860
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:43,712
An indictment is transferred from the house to the Senate

2861
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:48,320
Is there any actual case law surrounding this I would assume Alex wouldn't come up with this

2862
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,856
Completely unrelated cases

2863
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:50,880
Smoking Gun

2864
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,928
Really too bad the Barnes isn't

2865
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:56,256
I'm still around to ramble about lies and libel

2866
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,024
That's

2867
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,584
Just what do you need a constitutional lawyer

2868
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,192
Literally like that you can make your own f****** rules

2869
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,984
That's the whole point it now

2870
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,800
So

2871
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:11,104
I'm going to skip these next couple clips

2872
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,128
Cuz they're just Alex

2873
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:13,408
Rambling about Howard this

2874
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
Whole planet

2875
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,456
Give Hillary is president

2876
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:22,368
We kind of we kind of got it we get the tattoos idea if anybody actually like if we ever got it

2877
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:23,136
Into that situation

2878
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:24,672
Hillary was

2879
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:27,232
Somehow tried to sneak in

2880
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:28,256
I think you get a

2881
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:34,144
The backlash from the left I think that would be the one thing that causes an act

2882
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,168
Will third-party too high

2883
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,472
When is everybody on the left is being like

2884
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,752
We got it now

2885
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:43,872
F*** this you'd like to think that that's what flakka the Democrat like to think that's what that would happen in

2886
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:46,944
You know it's a nice thought maybe it would maybe it wouldn't

2887
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,480
But I think that you would have

2888
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:50,784
Incomplete

2889
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,576
Breakdown on the left

2890
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:55,904
Yeah from that saying nothing of what the right

2891
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,928
Response would be

2892
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:57,696
Just

2893
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:02,560
Within the last you would have

2894
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,864
Disinterest

2895
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:11,520
Honestly that might be the first time that I mean it whenever I say if Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2020

2896
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,288
I'm moving

2897
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,568
A note

2898
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,360
Eat my hat

2899
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:17,664
So Alex goes back to the phone

2900
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,224
You take the caller who as all of these

2901
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,016
Long

2902
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:22,784
Long

2903
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,064
Plug for his product

2904
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,600
And then Alex

2905
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,880
Have a string of Lies

2906
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,976
Everything that he exposed

2907
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:35,072
Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove nobody knew about ft nobody knew about Bilderberg

2908
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:37,632
Nobody

2909
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:43,520
I'm sorry wasn't Alex's the color Hood the string of Lies

2910
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,824
All those things are not true of Alex

2911
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,128
Some of them are just not true

2912
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:52,992
Like the Bohemian Grove was covered in reported on a dryer

2913
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,784
Other things

2914
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,344
Those are not sure if Alex either

2915
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,624
Picture of Bill Cooper

2916
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:01,952
They are they are true of the person

2917
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:03,744
Whose Legacy Alex's

2918
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:07,072
Stealing destroying upon himself burning

2919
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,864
Yeah it's it's really interesting

2920
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,632
Interesting dynamic

2921
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:15,008
I'm interested in looking more into that in the future but it is very

2922
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:22,176
We went over this weekend

2923
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:26,528
The most honest way for a man like that to go I guess

2924
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:28,832
Yeah I hate I hate it but it's

2925
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:34,208
Exactly the end always said

2926
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:40,096
I don't know you're very close to Somali pirate territory

2927
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,912
So Alex

2928
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,680
He's talking a little bit

2929
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:45,472
A little bit more about that

2930
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,752
The Christianity

2931
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:49,312
Needed anything and he sees it as quite a betrayal

2932
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,128
And like I said already

2933
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:53,408
You turn on Trump

2934
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:55,200
And you are now the devil

2935
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,480
You see that you're in this

2936
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:59,808
A lot of great people are evangelicals the Grassroots

2937
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:01,088
But the leadership

2938
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:02,624
Christianity Today

2939
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:06,464
Billy Graham's son supports Trump Christianity Today is not run by them

2940
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,280
Globalist Trump's bad

2941
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,840
That is devilish

2942
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:17,216
Trump defending Christians right

2943
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:21,824
Christianity Today is a den of deviled

2944
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,872
Are there works you shall know them

2945
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,408
So I mean you just

2946
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,456
If you fall out of Step your devil

2947
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:32,320
Definition of Christianity is supporting Trump

2948
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,880
According to Alex

2949
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:38,976
Emerging of religious and political ideas which is

2950
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:41,792
Like we are already had

2951
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,328
Suck leanings of

2952
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,632
Authoritarian dictator kind of

2953
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,656
Feelings for Alex

2954
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:52,032
We are we are merging that Theocratic I yeah pretty hard

2955
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:53,568
If they remove Trump

2956
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,616
You know and

2957
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,408
Got him out of office

2958
02:18:57,664 --> 02:18:58,176
Then

2959
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,200
You know the next

2960
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,992
The vice president of course would be

2961
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:02,784
I don't know and

2962
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:09,696
Real den of hell kind of hiding in the bushes

2963
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:16,096
F****** pain you might you might you might think the Christianity Today is

2964
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,376
More of the Mind

2965
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:22,240
Trump has done the damage he can do do a lot of the institutions

2966
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:28,384
Inception you know Mike Pence is a pretty good option for us evangelicos maybe it's time to cut bait

2967
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:32,224
On the bull in the china shop and go with a more steady hand

2968
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,528
That would be a good start

2969
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,320
Decision if you are a zealous

2970
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,368
Chris political

2971
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:42,464
And it's not like a Mike Pence's going to suddenly not

2972
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:46,304
Go after abortion Focus

2973
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:52,192
To pretend as priority everything that he just said Mike Pence would do if not as well

2974
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,728
Twice as hard bro

2975
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:55,776
31 last clip

2976
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:57,568
And I was just talking to a caller

2977
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,848
And this caller has

2978
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,128
Horrible

2979
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,152
Horrible cousin

2980
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,176
And Alex

2981
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:16,256
Seems like most Republicans do overwhelmed

2982
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:22,656
Impeachment

2983
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:29,056
84 walking down the country

2984
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:32,384
Smoking

2985
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:38,784
I'm just taking control sometimes was a dictator

2986
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,856
Criminal

2987
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,792
Alex

2988
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:57,472
Whether I love that passion because you're not lying down you're awake and you're not just screaming and yelling

2989
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:04,128
Focus point about what's happening

2990
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:06,432
Not saying program points except

2991
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,968
You kind of are just nevermind

2992
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:10,272
Reprogramming talkin coin

2993
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:14,368
I love that pants and I love that you're excited about the b******* I've gotten you

2994
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:17,440
Down the line of colors

2995
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:18,976
That's one of the things that

2996
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:21,024
You really see if you look at these colors

2997
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:23,584
Look at the colors that we've had on this show

2998
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:26,144
We have this guy who's internalize the message of

2999
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:27,936
Trump should be a dictator

3000
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,728
Clearly puts out whether he

3001
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,520
Expresses it that way or not

3002
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:36,128
You have to call or called in about Kate steinle who's expressing this xenophobic

3003
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:38,688
Anti-immigrant position that Alex's

3004
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,736
Very clearly fostered in his audience

3005
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,528
You got the guy calling in

3006
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,064
Who's the Scottish comedian

3007
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,856
Now it's clear the air once

3008
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:46,624
People who are

3009
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:53,536
Meyer minor viral stars that he can try and exploit

3010
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:55,328
When is the time start shooting people

3011
02:21:55,584 --> 02:22:01,728
Just something is a question that Alex is audience would clearly have based on his

3012
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,800
That's the only thing that I imagine that every show they think about

3013
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:06,848
You know you don't have callers calling in

3014
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:13,504
Really robots conversations about how do we ensure the treat peaceful transition of government throughout not just this

3015
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,600
Election but all elections to, assuming that we continue to be a democratic Nation

3016
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,368
I didn't hear that

3017
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,904
You didn't hear that

3018
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,440
So

3019
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:26,048
I mean I think at the end at the end of this episode he got like a real problem

3020
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:28,352
And it's the same problem and it's growing

3021
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:30,912
I don't I don't mean this to say like

3022
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:32,704
Something bad's going to happen

3023
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,752
Because I think it's entirely possible that one

3024
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:37,312
I don't know if Alex is colors are we

3025
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:43,712
I can't prove that either way

3026
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:46,528
Make the claim that these are all fake all right

3027
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,576
But a lot of radio shows do used

3028
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,136
Yeah so that's within the realm of possibility

3029
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:54,208
Yeah because

3030
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:59,072
There's an entire possibility that Alex has a miniscule Audience by this point that

3031
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:02,400
Whatever either way what are you putting out into the world

3032
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,168
Incredibly talk

3033
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:06,496
And

3034
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,056
I do I do think that as

3035
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,336
He is irrelevant

3036
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:14,176
To a lot of the larger conversation in the world that is definitely true

3037
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:16,480
But this show is getting BoRics

3038
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:18,272
The things that are

3039
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:20,064
Being much more openly

3040
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:21,088
Disgust

3041
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:23,648
Are the things that are really really fun

3042
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,976
Yeah the over white nationalism that is it

3043
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:29,024
Best through his retelling of a

3044
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,048
Fake version

3045
02:23:30,304 --> 02:23:31,840
Of Kate steinle murder

3046
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,608
Is

3047
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,144
Insane the

3048
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:37,472
Unacceptable in without doubt legally action

3049
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:39,776
The way that he expresses this

3050
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:44,128
His misreading of this 2001 un

3051
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,920
Population study

3052
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:48,224
Into being all Muslims act as one

3053
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,016
Is it incredibly dangerous

3054
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:54,112
Yep not to minimize it because I think he's very serious

3055
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:55,904
Kind of Fairly

3056
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:02,304
Standard for him maybe that one's not as much of an escalation pads

3057
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:05,120
Islam islamophobia in

3058
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:05,888
Anti-islam

3059
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:09,984
Yeah but

3060
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,520
Did the open discussion

3061
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:14,336
Mission of violin the open discussion of when is the time

3062
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:16,640
To kill people who should we be targeting

3063
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,176
Those conversations

3064
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:22,272
Are starting to happen on his show a bit more than I recall

3065
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:25,088
Yeah so that's that that is my big point

3066
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:26,880
It's worth noting that yeah

3067
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:31,744
Those guys

3068
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:33,536
Probably work

3069
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:38,144
Where other people work with them

3070
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:44,544
Right and those people have no idea that's sitting next to them is or maybe they do or may well yeah

3071
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:46,592
I'm just like

3072
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:50,944
I'm sure they tried to sell him brainforce

3073
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:53,248
IDK I don't have

3074
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,552
A lot of people who are Alex Jones fan

3075
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:56,320
Hands are open

3076
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:58,368
Right

3077
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:07,072
Lebanon future either I don't know maybe there's a lot of crypto info Warriors

3078
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,352
I have no idea

3079
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:10,656
I just think like

3080
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:15,520
I don't know it's really hard for me to put a button on this but I'm I'm trying

3081
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,544
The express

3082
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,080
That this is Escalade

3083
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,616
Yeah the tone

3084
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:20,640
And

3085
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,688
And what is okay

3086
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,712
To talk about on

3087
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,480
The show

3088
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:27,808
Whether or not that's because Alex is allowing those conversation

3089
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:29,344
More or the audience is

3090
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,112
Picking up on

3091
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:34,464
Anything but you also do notice that a lot of these things that are the worst

3092
02:25:34,976 --> 02:25:38,048
Are the product of his colors bringing stuff up

3093
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:41,632
Alex is terrible on his oh don't get me wrong I'm not saying that he's off the hook

3094
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:45,216
Write the parts of this episode that I think are the most f*****-up

3095
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:49,824
Are things that the callers have brought into the conversation without question

3096
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,360
And to me that indicate

3097
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,640
The audience

3098
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,432
Is responding to things

3099
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,968
That are on the show

3100
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,760
And be like well this is

3101
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:00,064
What's going on let's talk about it

3102
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:02,112
That's really bad

3103
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,648
That's me as a really bad sign

3104
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:06,464
Cuz if Alex is audiences diminishing

3105
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,024
What is he going to do what's the business decision

3106
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,304
Follow your audience

3107
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:13,120
You don't lead the audience anymore

3108
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:14,400
You can't afford to

3109
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:19,008
Also if you're in a civil war scenario you want to be at the

3110
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:26,176
Yeah I don't know I just you know what I wanted eulogize Godwin's law

3111
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:30,784
I really think that it was a valuable law for internet discourse early on

3112
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,576
And now

3113
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,368
You know it's dead because

3114
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:36,928
It only functions if both parties

3115
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,952
Are not actual

3116
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:41,280
When one party is just like yeah we're not

3117
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,096
Well I guess it's not valuable anymore

3118
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,376
Game over

3119
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,936
I don't I don't I don't know what

3120
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,472
Outside of

3121
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:52,800
As this process rolls along

3122
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:54,080
Lesbian p

3123
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:55,872
Richmond trial happen

3124
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:59,712
I just expect that trend

3125
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:01,760
Continue but I don't know if it's at

3126
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:03,040
Like I don't I don't

3127
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:07,904
I don't know how scared anybody should be about Alex putting this out into the world

3128
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,952
I mean obviously shouldn't do this

3129
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:13,280
But I don't know I don't want to be alarmed and I don't want to scare p

3130
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:16,864
Cuz I think I think ultimately

3131
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:20,192
Maybe no one's listening

3132
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,216
Yeah

3133
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,264
Yeah

3134
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:25,056
I'm not even that worried about

3135
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:26,336
What happens there

3136
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:27,872
It's only because

3137
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:32,480
The only way the Trump is going to be removed from office is if he

3138
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,784
Does if he keeps talking

3139
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:36,320
I mean it

3140
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:40,928
Pretty clear that he's the only one who's going to incriminate himself past the point of them defending

3141
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:46,048
Like no matter what evidence bring brings forth right the Republican party's going to defend him

3142
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:50,144
The only person who's going to make it impossible not to remove him from office

3143
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,168
It does seem

3144
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:52,192
So

3145
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:58,080
Then all these fears of like all when they remove them when they get rid of it are all going to deflate

3146
02:27:58,592 --> 02:27:59,360
So hard

3147
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,128
Right

3148
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:06,528
After after the towels over it

3149
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:12,672
A little bit not really because what's going to happen at least based on my understanding of things

3150
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:16,256
Things that have been said like the house is going to continue other investigation

3151
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:19,584
Sure is going to be stories

3152
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:20,608
Coming out about

3153
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:24,448
Think about the Trump Foundation or his businesses

3154
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,472
Right

3155
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:26,240
And that

3156
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,520
Because of the framing that I would

3157
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:28,800
Will be

3158
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,592
Like even though

3159
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,360
Trump is going to win

3160
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,408
Yeah these are the attempt

3161
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,200
Still remove him

3162
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,480
Yeah

3163
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:40,064
Prophecy is still validated even if the end conclusion is

3164
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,368
Him not being convicted in the right right

3165
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,184
They'll be the Colonel's

3166
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:49,280
Reality of his narrative the old made manifest

3167
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:52,096
Best in the world even though

3168
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:54,400
The inevitable conclusion of him probably

3169
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:55,168
Never

3170
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:55,936
Being convinced

3171
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:01,312
Even though that is still descend go along the way there's still the validation

3172
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:07,968
That goes along with it and then once you know the Senate trial concluded like that we were just too strong for

3173
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:10,272
Globus we stop them from being able to

3174
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,552
Play their tricks

3175
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:13,856
So now there is a need for a

3176
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:17,440
I just don't know how long that

3177
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:19,488
That this media environment

3178
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:21,024
Can continue to redline

3179
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:23,584
Like I just don't know how long

3180
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:27,936
Trump and how much money

3181
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:30,496
Because they're up there always redlining

3182
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:31,776
They're always getting people

3183
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:34,336
Closest possible to demote like

3184
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:36,128
Every morning on Fox

3185
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:39,456
Or whatever like you're always Redline

3186
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:42,528
And I just don't know how long you can Redline people

3187
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:47,136
Floater the car runs out of gas

3188
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:49,440
I don't I don't I don't even answer that question

3189
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:56,096
Anyway we'll see what happens but till then we have website

3190
02:29:56,352 --> 02:30:01,472
