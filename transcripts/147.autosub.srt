1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,384
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,272
I'm not going to ask you a question about the whole lotta Israel

4
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Where's a good

5
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,160
It's been a great deal

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
Which is very little yeah probably not

7
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,656
I don't disagree with that

8
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Situation

9
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
In Reverse though if you're going to use that same logic to apply doordash

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I apologize and I know a lot of

11
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:03,232
Different because I've got to watch WrestleMania of course

12
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
New Orleans tonight

13
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Single wrestling pay-per-view that you ever told me about his either been immensely disappointing

14
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
Facebook never been like

15
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
This was amazing it's always been

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
Storyline

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean I like the

18
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
Like the actual in-ring storytelling in the athletic

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,448
But I like imagining what could happen more than Hitler

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,776
Evan Weaver

21
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Collapses into

22
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
As much as

23
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
People may think

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Be that as it may

25
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,112
Alright the guy who's about to watch 7 hours of wrestling tomorrow doesn't like wrestling as much

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Writing articles

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
I'm going to be working

28
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
I miss you

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Because

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Saturday

31
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Recover from

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Since we recorded on Thursday

33
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,224
And then Friday

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Episode again

35
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
He had Paul Joseph Watson

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Studio

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
He was hosting for a bit

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Any plate

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Really long

40
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Video that Alex

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Made when he went out

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Ted Nugent

43
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Farm

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Show on

45
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
To go over

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
As always I was

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
Classic situation where you got to scramble

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
I'm so I remembered

49
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
2006

50
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
Why is that so crazy

51
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
It was very difficult

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,024
I remembered in 2006 is this is adorable

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Particularly interested

54
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Name some of like the more formative

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Alex Jones

56
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Remember that one of the biggest ones

57
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Date with a guy named

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Aaron Russo

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
And you know who that is

60
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Nope

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
But Alex is sort of used it as a foundation of a lot of

62
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
His narrative

63
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
And I realized

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
Alright

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
So I went back

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
7 hour long interview

67
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Why won't they tell us about building 7

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
It's not

69
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
It's not all that fun

70
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
To talk about anyway

71
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Okay

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
You do yeah

73
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
I don't know what you mean by Inside Job

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
Exactly

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Weather

76
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
Perpetrated by the

77
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
That

78
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
Reset the whole thing up in a in a

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,871
Zodiac style po-boy zodiac 70k

80
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
See that's what I think is going on

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Dick Cheney

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,551
Ephraim 70k Merica for their sin

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,647
So that is one of the deadly sins

84
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,023
Everett's no I was just going to go with Bill

85
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
7

86
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
Seven deadly sins

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
You could say that

88
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Aaron Russo

89
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
To be he's guilty

90
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
No maybe since 2000

91
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
70 East

92
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,087
But pretty lazy Prince death

93
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
He used to be a Hollywood producer

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
Hey came out before then as

95
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Prominence

96
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Is the producer for Bette Midler

97
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
In 19 in 1978 Primetime Emmy for

98
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,871
Special comedy variety or music for his work on Bette Midler

99
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Or older red hair is back

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Now that

101
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
Seminole

102
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,343
Do for me I remember growing up

103
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Bette Midler

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
Johnny the award that

105
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Has his IMDb credit

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
Although he did also produced trading place

107
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
Which is produced that but the rest of his resume I would call it

108
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Glutes

109
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
Wiseguys now

110
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Hold on

111
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Yeah

112
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Not good

113
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Threat

114
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,487
Because then I would really respect 1989

115
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
Cheech Marin but not Tommy Chong

116
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Stoner movie rude awakening

117
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Which he also co-direct

118
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
I don't know if you know the plot of that one but it's

119
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Cheech Marin

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
And someone who is not

121
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Play

122
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Who has retreated to the woods

123
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,015
Anime come back to society to find but all their Old Hippie friends are.

124
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Classic fish-out-of-water tale

125
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,623
Exactly

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
I don't know I haven't seen

127
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
Have to take a look I want to see how scores on IMDb

128
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Not positive

129
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
4.5 out of

130
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
You make it 7-4 director

131
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Sure sure

132
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Generously

133
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
In 1991 career

134
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
A b political

135
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
911

136
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
What I would call a film

137
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
In quote

138
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Called mad as hell

139
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
Which I cannot make more than 10 minutes

140
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Listen to when I tried watch

141
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
I thought it was going to be one of these documentaries

142
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
The people like Alex Jones

143
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Screw make

144
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
Keyboard like a one-man show

145
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Bitterness of a 50-year open my car

146
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,967
It's him out on a stage names

147
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
No but

148
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Play you a little clip

149
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
For mad as hell.

150
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
Give you a taste of what

151
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Energy he was bringing

152
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
A 49

153
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Freedom

154
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Back and forth

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
One second

156
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
Waiting there isn't why are people applaud them

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
I told you it's like

158
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,807
People applauding

159
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
That's a bit, is it doesn't go anywhere or have any

160
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Intuit

161
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Even have a

162
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Alexa

163
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
I do I don't understand

164
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
I really don't understand how any of this

165
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Dlisted

166
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,455
Infringes on the rights of the minority

167
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Especially speed limit

168
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
I guess

169
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah that's the real

170
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
History of

171
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
This being was just like

172
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Some people say one thing

173
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,863
And other people by saying different things

174
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,703
Right

175
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Conclusion from it

176
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Or have a point of view on it he's just observing people disagree on stuff prescriptive quality to

177
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,343
Trees like at least there's

178
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
Thought

179
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
The fact that I had to turn it off

180
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Prescribed

181
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
At some point

182
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
Where Cheech Marin goes into the woods

183
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Wiggle wiggle

184
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,991
2006 Rousseau wrote and directed a documentary called America freedom to Fascism

185
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Which of the foundational piece of Alex Jones's

186
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Philosophy

187
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Sprouts on the Infowars

188
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Prince's it all the time

189
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,999
He claims in the film the film

190
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
International Premiere to Patchogue

191
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Film Fest

192
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,983
The daring part

193
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
The film was not on the program that can

194
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
However not even for screenings made under the festivals

195
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
Without being in the competition

196
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
Mr. Russo the film's director writer and producer

197
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Just set up an inflatable screen on a beach

198
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Photographs posted at 1

199
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Mr. Russo's websites

200
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Audience of fewer than 50 people

201
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Spread out on a platform of

202
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Guerrilla film yourself gunship

203
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
I respect more than a lot of the people who were in The

204
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
It like that shity market

205
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Smashables

206
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Conspiracy bulshit

207
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
But it's mostly about how the federal income tax

208
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Is b******* always comes back

209
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Don't like

210
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
What a quarter of their pay

211
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Check going somewhere else

212
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Yeah they just don't get it

213
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
In order to make his argument

214
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Engages in

215
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Exactly the same sort of behaviors that

216
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
We saw Alex

217
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Do a Name Game

218
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
He fabricates quotes

219
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
I'm pregnant out of context in order to make quotes

220
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Something but in contacts

221
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Exact opposite

222
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
He treats

223
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Conjecture and hearsay

224
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
The same thing as

225
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Makes up sources

226
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
He never brings up and about to listen to

227
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Is it in 2006

228
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,511
But he was making anti-tax documentaries

229
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,143
And make it something sational claims has committed a crime of text

230
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
He has more than

231
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
$2000000 after filing exempt

232
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
She kind of has a vested in

233
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Maybe Lopez

234
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,759
So I will get to this interview and then along the way will learn a little bit more about that

235
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
You know those sorts of facts up front

236
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
Little bit of a flavor of where this guy's coming

237
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
From maybe Scientology is really just a normal

238
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Possibly could be a little

239
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
So here's the first

240
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Past and tells a

241
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Dubious story

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
The late 80s

243
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
I was pretty big silver

244
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Trader

245
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Schrader

246
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
I don't even tell the story on tape

247
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Supreme accelerate lingerie

248
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
I took

249
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
What was illegal tax

250
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Seduction on my Soldier

251
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Seriously

252
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
The

253
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Iris

254
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Claim

255
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
That what I did

256
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
As well

257
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,255
Now that's against the law. That's not good so you always 600 or 800 thousand dollars

258
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
It was legal to make something

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
What's the time

260
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
It makes no sense

261
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
What we doing it

262
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
And so everybody

263
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Retroactively

264
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,807
That there was something wrong America with the IRS in the system

265
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Sure

266
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Listening to that claim

267
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,767
Can clearly surmise that he is telling the truth so far he has become nothing but a

268
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Biohazard

269
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
Highest rating about Estates

270
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,031
Now I'm sure that you have done research on this claiming you will absolutely back it up Tia Carrere

271
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,615
Well ex post facto laws

272
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
Something illegal that wasn't illegal before he

273
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Have always been

274
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Illegal

275
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
In terms of criminal

276
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Sybil

277
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
Cases and stuff like that

278
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Applause

279
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Most of the

280
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
Adore people have broccoli

281
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Offender registry

282
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Where people

283
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Have made the argument that when it be

284
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Became required to register as a sex

285
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
Sex offender that's adding punitive

286
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Consequences on that didn't exist

287
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Before

288
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Handkerchief

289
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
It's only been like

290
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
No

291
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Yeah I'm going to go

292
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
I don't know anyways with tax stuff

293
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
You can

294
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Do ex post facto

295
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Laws

296
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Typically speaking

297
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
That's just because of

298
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
Right to happen that way I have a tax loss

299
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Ends up getting past

300
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Generally speaking

301
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
What they will do

302
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
Backdated to the beginning of the fiscal year

303
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
So it's

304
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Skip to the beginning of the year

305
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Is the only pic

306
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
Grievous circumstances

307
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
20 years that would never fly

308
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Never fly

309
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
This is from the Congressional research service

310
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Any retroactive tax legislation

311
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
Found to be a criminal penalty

312
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Will likely be struck down as violation

313
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Ex post facto clause

314
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
Which of the Supreme Court has done on at least one occasion

315
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Extremely rare

316
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Circumstances

317
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Legislation B

318
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Seems to Target

319
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Get certain taxpayers

320
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Microwaves

321
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Concerns under the equal protection

322
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Guarantees of the fifth

323
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
Finally it might also be asked whether such legislation is

324
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Beloved

325
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
When there do not appear to

326
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Any instance

327
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Occurring

328
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
It seems possible that a retroactive tax

329
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Play some good depending on its

330
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Pacific meet the criteria to be

331
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Be a bill of attainder

332
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Circumstances wherein

333
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Yeah you'd have

334
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Crime being done

335
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Bye-bye

336
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
His story doesn't

337
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Check out

338
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
All that well I don't necessarily believe

339
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
The line

340
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,895
He's spitting I think it's probably a thing where I was like it's backdated to

341
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
To the beginning of this fiscal year and you like

342
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
I got to pay a bunch more than I wanted to

343
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
The creative mythology

344
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Codeworks

345
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Trader

346
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
That's that Alex Jones

347
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,031
You already know that you didn't

348
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Right preload

349
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,223
Tell you this long-winded fictional story let me start by saying

350
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
My taxes that's just

351
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
In 2006

352
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
Whether or not

353
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
He pays attack

354
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
The relevant issues

355
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
This next clip where he

356
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Explains that she doesn't believe in taxes

357
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
But he's not going to tell people not to

358
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
To pay their taxes

359
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
Legal gray area right there

360
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
You don't advise

361
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
2

362
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Not

363
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Single

364
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
And I like the way you summed it up

365
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
It's really very simple I mean

366
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Since making that movie

367
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
You know how many people come to me and ask me what I should pay the record taxes or not

368
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
You know and I never devised people not to pay

369
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
And the reason I said tell him I said look

370
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
I've done a lot of research

371
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
The Supreme Court has ruled

372
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,519
The IRS has no Authority

373
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Nope

374
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
Supreme Court

375
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
That being the case

376
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
The fastest if the mafia come to you

377
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
And say

378
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,415
We want $2,000 a month so we're going to hurt you

379
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
I would not advise you not to pee

380
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Doesn't matter

381
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Okay

382
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
Literally the 16th

383
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Alright

384
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on income from whatever Source derived without

385
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,919
Apportioned among the several States

386
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Any sensatori numeration

387
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
I would argue that

388
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Taxes on income from whatever Source derived

389
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Does include your labor

390
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Is over your income

391
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
I don't know

392
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
Call out

393
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Does problems with

394
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Commandments

395
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Defecation

396
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
One of them is that Ohio weather

397
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
The state would it was ratified

398
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,943
States ratify it to pass as an amendment in ar41 really doesn't matter if Iowa

399
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Bunk

400
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
That's very considerate

401
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
What is the most prominent

402
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Petitioners

403
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
You operated on

404
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
18th Amendment concerns

405
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Name of William JB

406
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
He wrote a book

407
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Call the

408
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Like the biggest law that never was

409
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Something like that

410
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
He's another one of these guys kind of

411
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
Sure of like writing books that so you don't have to pay taxes

412
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
It's really dangerous

413
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
He sort of rhetoric

414
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
But his argument

415
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
The text of the Amendment ratified in different states

416
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Insomuch as

417
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
The spelling words

418
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
Different capitalization and stuff like that

419
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,359
Real human being

420
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,943
Right he made the argument

421
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
Because of these capitalization and punctuation

422
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Application of the six

423
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
Amendment was and now we learn

424
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Children

425
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Oxford,

426
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Considered back during the ratification

427
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Sometimes even

428
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
This doesn't matter

429
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,967
In terms of like that being

430
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
To think that income tax was not legal

431
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
All over the f***

432
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Complacent

433
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:22,560
I don't know what these people were talking about

434
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
So based on this stupid ARG

435
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
He stopped paying his taxes

436
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Naturally he eventually was

437
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Convicted of tax evasion and failure

438
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Willful failure

439
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
To file tax

440
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Returns

441
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
4 /

442
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
A hundred thousand dollars of unreported in

443
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay on December 17th 2017 States District Court

444
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
For the northern district of Illinois

445
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
Ratification argue

446
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Give me a call

447
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Fraud perpetrated by Benson

448
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,256
Cosmo

449
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
I like

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
He got sent

451
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,936
Thanks for being a douchebag because this argument is already been

452
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Using that as your legal

453
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Backing

454
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,800
For your I don't want to pay my taxes yet

455
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
You're doing that

456
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
In full awareness

457
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
That this question has been settled

458
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
This stuff like this

459
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Legitimately

460
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Did Aaron Russo is paddling on the show is

461
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Demonstrable enochtrue

462
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Has been dealt with in the courts over and over and over again

463
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,768
To the point where people who have these anti-tax argument

464
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Good

465
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
Until you're looking to the actual details and then you realize that

466
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,448
People keep going to court for the stuff and they lose

467
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Every time

468
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Usually have

469
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,360
Yeah they lose every type of that kind of

470
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,224
What like the wealth preachers that go on TV where it's like

471
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
And he's selling his book under the same premise

472
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
But

473
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
If you

474
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
Do what he says whippin you buys book

475
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
You just wind up going to jail

476
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Basically

477
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
It was actually even address

478
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
Perpetrating a scam

479
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
Dangerous to them

480
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
And he knows

481
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
He knows or has

482
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Them to know that that's what he's doing

483
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Who

484
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
It's reference Tesla

485
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
He Went A-Courtin

486
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
He made the argument

487
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
So he ended up

488
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
The court case

489
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
Vettex protesters reference

490
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
That's because

491
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
He ended up losing the civil case

492
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,264
That was attached to it and ended up still being liable to pay all the taxes

493
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
But he won a case

494
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
Wearing it was a quart

495
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Was proved

496
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
But he wasn't

497
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Willfully

498
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Breaking the law

499
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,208
They didn't find him guilty of intentional

500
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
Basically yes long and short of it

501
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Subsequent

502
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
Attempts to use that as president

503
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
I have been like

504
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Good god no

505
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,544
All of this stuff is so crazy

506
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Just like right

507
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,992
Yeah that's more or less the Holy Grail of

508
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
These attacks protesters nonsense Target

509
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
Next clip we already got a little bit of a

510
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
Russo in his one-man show

511
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
The idea that like majority

512
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Rolex

513
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Songs YouTube

514
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Okay

515
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
I'm referring more to the majority rule aspec

516
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
Right

517
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Before he does

518
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
He's got to do his best impression

519
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
Of

520
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
I don't know college

521
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
I'm smoking a joint

522
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Politics are Dormer

523
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
The American people are living in The Matrix

524
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
They don't understand the truth of how things work in this country

525
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
You know

526
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,472
Let me give an example of what I'm talking about 100 people in the street

527
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
What kind of government

528
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Is America supposed to be

529
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,152
99% of them will tell you a democracy

530
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
America supposed to be a democracy

531
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
But that's a lie

532
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
That's an illusion

533
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,648
Democracy

534
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
It's not in the Bill of Rights

535
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
Separation of Independence

536
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
The founding fathers

537
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
The idea of a democracy

538
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,400
Why they create the river.

539
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
Democracy

540
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
51% of the people

541
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Control 49% of the people

542
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
Percent you're not free

543
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,688
America was founded as a constitutional republic

544
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Constitutional republic that we have

545
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Ninety-nine percent of the people

546
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
Cancel

547
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
You have your rights cuz she was born with them

548
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Human rights

549
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
I got bad news about Republic

550
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
Really also

551
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
Really don't like this whole you have rights cuz God gave them to you

552
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,960
Using that metaphorically

553
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,848
It's fine

554
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
In a republic

555
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,808
You could still have the representatives 51% of

556
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Publix

557
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,584
51 tons

558
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
Also Supreme Court decisions could go on 54 there's 32 the last

559
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Right I mean

560
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,640
Or even like a little bit before but like

561
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
What year was exactly but

562
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Certainly

563
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
In the mid

564
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
I2 later 1900s

565
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
Women couldn't work as bartender

566
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,256
In bars that were called by a male relative but that just makes sense

567
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,840
Take away a right on majority rule

568
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:22,240
Supreme Court decision give me the right-to-work

569
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
Because women have one less rib or something I don't know I don't know

570
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
God works like that

571
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Are we

572
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
I don't know I don't understand because like I don't want to get a drink from anything that bleeds once

573
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
The month and doesn't die

574
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
It's about the majority rule aspect of a democracy

575
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Is exactly the same as

576
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
Arguments that could be levied against

577
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
A majority rule in a

578
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,056
Any majority rule whatsoever

579
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:02,944
Government entirely by anything other than a fascist dictator

580
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Libertarian folk end up

581
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Accidentally added

582
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
Waiting for exactly that under the pretense of individual rights

583
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
Tell you what to do

584
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Right

585
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Bright

586
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Beb

587
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
I don't even know how to

588
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
I don't know how to deal with

589
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
That's because like

590
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
You couldn't couldn't

591
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
Vote like let's say if you have a right

592
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
To employ my

593
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
Or whatever

594
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Person who lives

595
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
United States

596
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Yet God gave us that one.

597
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
51st

598
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
51% of the public came out to vote

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
And we're like alright

600
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
You can't

601
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Look for work anymore

602
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Right

603
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
I don't know

604
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Stephen Gunn

605
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Even gun stuff

606
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
You couldn't vote on

607
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
Know what there's no way that would fly

608
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,224
There's a massive majority abortion is not an issue that would be on a

609
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
There would be

610
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Unrestricted

611
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
In the same way all of this

612
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
I was just

613
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
His words are empty

614
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
And when you consider not

615
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Some kind of like

616
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Judicial scholar he's not up

617
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Professor

618
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
He's a guy who was

619
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Bette Midler's manager

620
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Directed and produced at

621
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
Cheech Marin movie Midler only hires the greatest legal Minds to assist her on anything

622
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
I could be the canoes

623
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
Has argued multiple courses in the Supreme

624
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Okay

625
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
I did not know that

626
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
Good coffee

627
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Actually democracy

628
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
What

629
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
What is intelligent people

630
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
What former Governor America supposed to be

631
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
That's what that's what they've been brainwashed

632
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,568
Believing that

633
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Play believer in Iraq

634
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
Democracy

635
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Democracy

636
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,784
George Bush Senior microsiemens freedom

637
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Real quick

638
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
I'll tell you didn't believe that

639
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Liberal

640
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
In 2002-2003

641
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
This is Aaron Russo in 2006

642
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,328
This is already a tired line of rhetoric based on like

643
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Protest

644
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
That I was involved in in Columbia Missouri

645
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
What's bigger another city

646
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
I experienced

647
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
These words

648
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
This democracy thing is a sham

649
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,760
The argument is it is nonsense is travel territory for people

650
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Other side

651
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
From people like

652
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
No

653
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
Democracy equals New World Order

654
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,000
Democracy equals slavery

655
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Word democracy is not synonymous with freedom

656
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
What's the opposite of freedom

657
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
If the United States what is it

658
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
If the United States is a republic

659
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Perseus

660
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,688
We have some really f****** long time

661
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
The original founders of our Republic we're the ones who literally ruling the play

662
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,840
Democracy is the worst form of government you can have to switch re-roll

663
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
Exactly

664
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
What they want to tell you to do

665
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
The majority wants it wants

666
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,824
My life as I choose

667
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
If I don't commit violence

668
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Uproar

669
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
It's nothing you and being

670
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
I can live my life as I wish

671
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,344
So you can't commit fraud news about the show you're off

672
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Why is they always pick

673
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,512
The ones they're doing well to be fair that's a pretty consistent

674
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
Because it's that like

675
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
If I

676
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Commit violence against

677
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Encroaching on your right

678
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,496
Encroaching on your right to proper

679
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
If it's fraud against you I'm stealing

680
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
From you through

681
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,224
Whatever they hold the belief that

682
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
It was always out of self

683
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
It was mine to begin with

684
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
Give me the song YouTube

685
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,304
Push it when it comes down to their behavior is really all they do

686
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,704
Both sides of the coin

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,032
Do whatever I want

688
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
You're committing fraud

689
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
Yeah you just say

690
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
You just said that the

691
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,040
16th Amendment doesn't apply to the ability for the government to collect taxes the IRS

692
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Now

693
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
Isn't as a government entity to

694
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Do that

695
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Peppa 16th Amendment is being violated

696
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Ed Court Suki

697
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Distantly ruled on this one of those

698
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,680
That's a fraud he's professional one of those things where a guy is trying to use the insanity defense

699
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,728
I before E actually goes to trial

700
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
He's trying to act

701
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,896
Set up as he's all crazy like he's doing the stupidity defense but he's just throwing it out there like

702
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
Like the lookout Jamaya

703
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:30,624
Stupid tried to do at the Michael in one of his last

704
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,208
Appeals he was trying to save it

705
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,560
That he believed that he was the only person who could interpret tax law correctly

706
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:44,192
Alright this got blown up cuz one of his co-defendants

707
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
Imitate

708
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
We hate to have to use this kind of a defense but

709
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
So

710
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
It was like a it was a Hail Mary kind of thing to try and get him out of prison mail the invalidation of your

711
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,976
You think it's only going to your supporters and they're the only ones we're going to see it but no

712
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Hellboy

713
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,776
Wow stupid to be willfully line

714
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Well then

715
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,272
This that this f****** Aaron Russo commits another fraud on air

716
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
What happens is

717
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,368
Now the government borrows money from them

718
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
The fund the government

719
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
It's all about the Federal Reserve

720
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
Let's impose a tax

721
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Existed before

722
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
Ronald Reagan said not one red Cent

723
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,920
Your income tax

724
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Commission report

725
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,832
That's said that one nickel goes to the

726
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Infrastructure the country

727
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
So that's fun

728
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
What do you know about the grace report the grace

729
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Commission report

730
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Put through I don't know

731
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
I know it's almost certainly stupid

732
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,056
Associated with Ronald Reagan it would definitely not be prosecuted for willful

733
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,640
From Aaron Russo in Alex Jones

734
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,712
Perpetuating an idea of it's in the report

735
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
They found at Reagan

736
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
That none of your income tax money goes

737
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,464
To paying any programs or anything at all goes to paying off interest

738
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
To these bankers

739
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
These International Bankers in the Federal Reserve

740
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Oh yeah the bottle

741
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Quote

742
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,240
Do you from the report cuz I read way too much

743
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
I don't know how to do impressions

744
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Nope

745
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,968
I like it the quote from the report that they're misusing

746
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,064
With two-thirds of everyone's personal income tax wasted or not collect

747
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,464
Did 100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt and by federal government contributions to transfer

748
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
For payment

749
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,608
In other words all individual income tax revenues are gone before one Nicholas spent on the services

750
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
The taxpayers expect

751
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
From their government

752
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Important

753
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
That what is actually being

754
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Said they're

755
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Is more to the effect

756
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Everything is getting face

757
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Did you see that

758
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Beginning there

759
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
Two-thirds of everyone's personal income tax wasted

760
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
It's important

761
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
Consider what Reagan

762
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Considered wasting

763
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Of tax money

764
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,208
Very important

765
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,536
So

766
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
Remembering

767
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Anyting

768
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
This is everything except jelly beans

769
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
Everything except

770
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
What Russo's claimed

771
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:04,128
Your taxpayer money is illegally funding

772
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
The grace commission which itself

773
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,296
75 million dollars

774
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Found that there was

775
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,184
424 billion dollars of waste in

776
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Spending

777
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,304
That Rousseau extract doesn't take into account

778
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Is

779
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
Is that that

780
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Number is cited in the report

781
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
What's up

782
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
Recommendation

783
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Did this Commission

784
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Can come out

785
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
I read dcboe

786
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
Congressional budget office

787
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Assessment

788
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Commission report

789
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:45,856
Aaron Russo Alex Jones read that either

790
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,184
Cboc

791
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,256
The thing that the Great Commission

792
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Considered waste

793
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
And what part of that 424 billion dollars negative

794
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
State Department clearly

795
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
So you're some of the suggestions

796
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
Reduce food stamp Child Nutrition overlap

797
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,016
Consolidate Student Loan program

798
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
Spell unneeded public land

799
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
Modify federal employees health benefit program

800
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
You trying to get the sense that

801
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Get some of those are probably code

802
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
How are you going to save money modifying the federal employees health care benefits program get rid of a lot of

803
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,472
Is felony programs

804
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Probably

805
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,872
Let's pinch these kids or modify

806
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,992
Reduce civil service retirement benefits

807
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
Repeal or modify davis-bacon Act

808
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
Which is a 1931 United States federal law that establishes the requirements

809
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,256
Preparing the local prevailing wages for public works progress

810
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
For Laborers and mechanics

811
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Also repeat

812
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
Remke delauer modify Walsh

813
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Keowee public contract Act

814
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,056
Which establishes minimum wage maximum hours and safety

815
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Standards for workers on contract

816
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
Excess of $10,000

817
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,688
The manufacturing or Furnishing materials

818
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,504
Supplies articles or equipment to the US government

819
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,416
Circuit and it's another one of those let's cut Corners bypass

820
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
Reasonably assume

821
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
We're getting those larger contract

822
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Could probably absorb

823
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Some of that

824
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
You know potato

825
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Three individual laborers

826
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
They're getting f*****

827
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,240
Course VA Healthcare facility

828
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
Construction

829
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
Daycare fight and die for our country would you find to be so important

830
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,112
They're done they're done right

831
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:59,232
Also restricts federal employee disability benefits

832
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,104
To get hurt just paid annual leave benefits for federal employees

833
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:23,552
From The New York Times the red knuckle front 1984 while this was going on

834
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,952
Possible at least at this stage to calculate actual or likely total savings from the commission's work

835
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
These were already under consideration

836
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
75 million dollars with fat to end up with

837
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,912
Conclusions that Reagan and his friends wanted

838
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
Just to get rationalization and things

839
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
You see in it are largely

840
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Get rid of

841
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
Start helping program

842
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Don't want to see their mother

843
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
Go to don't you understand this elaborate fraud against libertarian ideas

844
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Russo is perpetuating with the help

845
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
Very complacent help of Alex Jones

846
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Is this idea that

847
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
All of your income tax

848
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
It just goes to

849
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Pay off the interest on

850
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
Federal debt

851
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,680
This report he's using it in your friends

852
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,752
Right exactly

853
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Say that

854
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
F****** b*******

855
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Anyway

856
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,968
I'm curious about that we all recognize Reagan was one of our

857
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
God bless

858
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
And the only way to get up on top of that Hill is to

859
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
You stand on top of the Dead Corpses

860
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,536
Everybody knows that the grace commission report is like

861
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
If it being used in this context

862
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Infuriating if you care about the

863
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
And if you care about the true

864
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
All you care about is trying to

865
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
To push bogus

866
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Anti-tax

867
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
Anti-Federalists

868
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
It's Manna From Heaven

869
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:58,015
Cuz really easy to misrepresent ain't nobody can read that 600 pages easy to misrepresent

870
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,599
Even if you follow up on it you're like these are great ideas

871
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
And I like that kind of

872
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Of course

873
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Of course you want to

874
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
Use the report

875
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,791
It says f*** over the Ford be like see

876
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
They're f****** over the poor

877
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Evil it is the taxes are due

878
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Just taken out of your check

879
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
Yeah you should have to write him a letter every time

880
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
Control

881
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
Exactly

882
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,183
Automatically

883
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
No s***

884
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
That's my response that no f******

885
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,887
Do you understand operate any sort of organization

886
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Would you like

887
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
You guys will take care of it

888
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
Lakeview massive number of people

889
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
People who I like

890
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Alex

891
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
Aaron Russo

892
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,455
Would destroy weather

893
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,343
Even when their people are filling out their tax returns are still on

894
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,695
That I have a child

895
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
The other thing is that like if you

896
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,239
System in place

897
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
You would end up

898
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,823
Creating a much larger tax system

899
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
Because investigators

900
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,199
Tons of people who go out in like

901
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,783
Hunt people down for not paying their taxes

902
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,367
If we didn't have to pay the minimum wage or take care of their benefits

903
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,207
It all makes sense

904
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
Collectors making $6 an hour

905
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:51,167
What is a gyro government is the diametric opposite

906
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Of what you want

907
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
Smaller tax system

908
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
And that would create a

909
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,663
That would have been for almost everybody

910
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
I just I just don't want

911
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
I need

912
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
It's just

913
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,487
These stupid intellectualizing of it goes back to

914
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
To these

915
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Visitor

916
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Bogus

917
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,191
That are misrepresenting actual cases of the Christian response to evolution

918
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,775
Like whatever they would like the Creation Museum

919
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
It's not just like

920
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Well we reject their sign

921
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
Their Sciences

922
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,711
Hahaha

923
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,527
Yeah we do science with their

924
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Doing it

925
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
And weak

926
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
Right

927
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Jordan you ready for this

928
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
To take a huge turn

929
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Because

930
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,679
Really think that every time somebody with a Southern accent

931
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Does the word slaves they should have

932
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
To pay a dollar

933
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
I think that's a reasonable thing reduce government

934
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Colorado collect dollars

935
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
People in the South saying the words laser

936
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,527
Everything changed

937
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
You

938
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
We talked a lot about taxes up till this point

939
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
And now everything changes

940
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,487
Get back to the new I had a friend

941
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Nick Rockefeller

942
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,119
I'll tell you who's on the Rockefeller family

943
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:31,007
When I was running for governor Nevada he can't answer me introduce himself to me to an attorney

944
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,591
We became friends

945
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Turn off Alaska mr.

946
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
And one of the things that we say

947
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
To talk about

948
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
What's the Arsenal plan

949
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
Dancing in the Street what they want to accomplish

950
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
What do you think about that

951
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Well

952
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
The Rockefeller was

953
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
Clearly recruiting him

954
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
For the globalist

955
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Emphasis

956
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
This is while he's running

957
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
For governor correct

958
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
I see you now Alex

959
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Correct

960
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
He's going to say no

961
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
You were recruited by the global

962
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
What do you have to say about Aaron

963
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Aaron

964
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
You

965
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Have tried to take over

966
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Through globalist mean

967
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,111
Clearly you have learned something from this and now you are coming back to me

968
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,743
To rectify this makes mistakes you're going to tell us the secrets behind the globalist

969
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
And Howard

970
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
People who

971
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Clearly have

972
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Internet

973
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Good ideas

974
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Into something evil

975
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
What are the

976
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,799
Industries wanted to what did Rod what Global is

977
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
The secret

978
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
Your aunt has some interesting

979
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
Threads that will continue as we go along

980
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,575
What you should know is this guy Nick Rockefeller

981
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,647
May or may not exist as

982
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
As Aaron Russo describes

983
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
From what is from what is available research cuz there is a picture of him with a guy who is

984
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,447
Rockefeller

985
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
Who is the lawyer he's a lawyer

986
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,455
Remember or a permanent member

987
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
You might just be someone who join for business

988
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,599
Contact or something like that cuz if you look at the role of members

989
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
It's a ridiculously huge list of people

990
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
That doesn't prove s***

991
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
There's no evidence that I can

992
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,071
Can find that he was related to the Rockefellers

993
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
There's where we run

994
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,263
I also cannot find any

995
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
Rockefeller records

996
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,663
IQ

997
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
I'll stick to the facts

998
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,039
What everybody wants

999
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,183
Aaron Russo ran for the governorship of Nevada as a Republican

1000
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,767
Republican primary

1001
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
6% of the vote

1002
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
You don't want

1003
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
The Democratic

1004
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
The candidate

1005
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
And who would be Russo in the primary

1006
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
He's all over

1007
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,079
Is there in 2004

1008
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
That guy beat me

1009
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
F*** that

1010
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
It's possible that was the motivation

1011
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
If possible

1012
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,159
2402 run for president

1013
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
He won the first round of voting in the libertarian primary

1014
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
To vote

1015
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Which was not a large enough margin

1016
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
The name of the candidates

1017
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Coming out of the convention

1018
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
They had another ballot

1019
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,703
You're going to lose the final ballot by 89 votes for

1020
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
3 to 3:44

1021
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
So

1022
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
In 2004 at that point

1023
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
You'd already

1024
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Been diagnosed

1025
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
The bladder cancer

1026
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,503
And that's what I'm pn's of dying a year after

1027
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Interview with Alex

1028
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
You'd already been suffering

1029
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Struggling with cancer

1030
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
Right

1031
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Might inform

1032
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
Some of the

1033
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,071
Because the other two million-dollar tax

1034
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
He has

1035
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
I've been battling

1036
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
I think that

1037
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
Not to save

1038
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
It sure seems like he would benefit from

1039
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,359
More government spending on Healthcare

1040
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,407
It would also

1041
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
Being unable to afford both Healthcare anti

1042
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
It would also appear

1043
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
But he would stand to benefit

1044
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
From creating a documentary

1045
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
Called America freedom

1046
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Fascism

1047
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
And I'm creating

1048
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,327
Niche market for himself by going on Alex Jones Show

1049
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
I'm saying that he knows all the secrets

1050
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
It seems like that is a

1051
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:51,103
Pretty good to make a lot of money from that I believe he may have

1052
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
Now prove to me

1053
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Larry Nichols

1054
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Existed before 2000

1055
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:00,063
I think I can I had Aaron Russo faked his own death and became Larry

1056
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,183
No because of Larry Nichols involvement in the early Clinton scandal

1057
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Troopergate

1058
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
Stuff like that

1059
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,583
For governor Nevada

1060
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:17,727
He was producing a Cheech Marin

1061
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,775
Nichols Road

1062
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,127
Larry Nichols

1063
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
That's probably not

1064
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
McKay's

1065
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
Larry Nichols did Ghost write most of Bette Midler

1066
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
So I missed next clip we get to learn a little bit of what this

1067
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Mysterious Nick Rockefeller told

1068
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,439
Aaron Russo about the globalist

1069
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Notice

1070
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Not using the term global

1071
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
The international bankers

1072
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,167
So these people have in mind

1073
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
Is the gold to

1074
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Credit One

1075
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
Run by the bank

1076
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,591
The street run by the bank

1077
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
We're doing insects

1078
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
The European currency euro

1079
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,759
European Constitution

1080
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Is one part of it

1081
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,111
Not trying to do in America with the North American Union

1082
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,439
Right and I want to create a new currency called the Amero

1083
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,791
Right but I've worked

1084
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
Is to create a One World Government

1085
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,399
Where everybody has

1086
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
Gotta

1087
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
Is Tubi

1088
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
In those chips

1089
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
Tips

1090
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,463
And so so anytime you have money in your in your in your

1091
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
Whatever they want to take out

1092
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
I find us just

1093
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Slightly

1094
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
You know why

1095
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Mainly because

1096
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
1

1097
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
Pretty sure we do

1098
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:02,431
To some extent have an international One World Government that is run by the Bay

1099
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Insofar as being

1100
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Tire economics

1101
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
The world is

1102
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Sure

1103
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,647
Perfect

1104
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,279
Very mindful way of organizing Society

1105
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,071
Ghetto capitalism exist

1106
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,167
That is an inevitable conclusion of it because eventually you need to get into other mark

1107
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
NetSpend

1108
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
I mean capitalism has a

1109
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Has a vested

1110
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
Not even in

1111
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Because of that

1112
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
You can't ever

1113
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Look at the highest levels of

1114
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
You can't just limit yourself

1115
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Even if you did

1116
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
Still need trade

1117
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,903
Clear resources from other places

1118
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,207
Capitalism is a

1119
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
Almost a disease

1120
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Like

1121
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,095
Spreads and it only has water

1122
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
He's all over RS

1123
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Sprite

1124
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
I mean

1125
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
You do what you do

1126
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,271
Purpose based on the technology

1127
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Having a f****** debit card

1128
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,671
You know I mean pretty much exactly like lose my debit card

1129
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Fuct

1130
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
I can't buy or sell without a debit card

1131
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
And that's not something

1132
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Evil

1133
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
Can see out of an ATM

1134
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
Or whatever

1135
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,727
First Convenience issues that it does address

1136
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,567
Never I think no self-respecting world government

1137
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Would ever go for that

1138
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
Just because of how hat

1139
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:42,783
You know what I mean it's angry gun-toting

1140
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
Let's give it to them in something they can hold

1141
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
Well I think is how all of our debit cards have come

1142
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,583
Computer chips inside of them that function in the exact same way as what it is

1143
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,679
He's describing a passport

1144
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,799
And what is your what is your business with

1145
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,639
Have chips in them

1146
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,735
World government is what

1147
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,319
It is like I don't want a One World Government run by

1148
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
Xi Jinping

1149
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,999
I don't want to write one world government run by the entire got it either

1150
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,655
The problem with one world government is that most governments around the world are s***

1151
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:34,495
Well I mean even if you take the world government aspect out of it

1152
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,543
Like I don't want our government

1153
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,871
Big run this way I don't want

1154
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,271
It's not an issue of scale it's either bad I don't think countries are anywhere near as

1155
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:52,671
As their shity governments that are f****** everybody having a central one

1156
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,999
Necessarily not the worst

1157
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Maverick

1158
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Very Bad Things

1159
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,071
Look for now

1160
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,167
Because of the unevolved fate of all the world

1161
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,263
Yeah I with exception of something at some places in like Scandinavia

1162
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,079
The only the only difference between a One World Government

1163
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Now

1164
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
And what we have

1165
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Is that

1166
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
Instead everybody in the world would just be

1167
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:23,135
Reflect over in the same way that touches on what

1168
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
The fear is

1169
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
That the capital f

1170
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
Fear

1171
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
I'll do it one world government

1172
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Alex

1173
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:34,143
And that is that is there is a unified One World Government there's nowhere you

1174
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
You can go

1175
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
So like

1176
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
If fascism took over in America

1177
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Horrible authoritarian

1178
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
You could still run away to Europe

1179
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
Or something like that

1180
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
Whereas if there was a unified One World Government

1181
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,479
Then you would never be able to escape it without getting off the

1182
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
The planet which is

1183
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
This point

1184
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
You couldn't do as a city

1185
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
In Alex Jones World in 2018

1186
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,207
Of course you can absolutely

1187
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,583
Not really

1188
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,423
But like so I get that

1189
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
For similar reasons

1190
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,519
You were espousing about

1191
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
Most governments

1192
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
But I don't

1193
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
Support

1194
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
Chippewa government

1195
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
Butchers from very different reasons

1196
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
And I don't think

1197
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
It's going that way I don't think the fact that

1198
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
Figaro exist

1199
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
Going hard the opposite way current there has not been

1200
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
Sincere efforts

1201
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,671
To create

1202
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:33,023
I'm at the Amero I know it's been discussed but it's always been around

1203
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Just based on the

1204
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
I did

1205
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:40,959
Complications that would come from the differences of opinion

1206
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,311
Air Canada America Mexico to know there's no way to be able to come

1207
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,847
Agreement about how it's

1208
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Laid out

1209
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Record wouldn't

1210
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,223
Everytime it gets suggest

1211
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
No that's not Lisa

1212
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
Because countries

1213
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Themselves are not

1214
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
Unified

1215
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Blocks

1216
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
So you know

1217
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:04,511
As much as your identity maybe I'm American or I'm

1218
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
Canadian

1219
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
The guys in Canada who are like

1220
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,167
Government is it real are more in the same country as I

1221
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:15,263
The guys in America who like government is it isn't real as opposed to

1222
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,383
Country isn't the difference between those two people

1223
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
And that's an argument

1224
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
For globalism

1225
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Because

1226
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:30,623
Our borders are abstract ideas with l-theanine

1227
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
I disagree with your

1228
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
We should put

1229
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Like Alex and 21

1230
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,119
Translate

1231
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,679
Let's get the Arizona look

1232
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
If you don't think there should be government

1233
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
You get Arizona there's no government there you guys figure your own s*** out and everybody else will be fine be ultimate irony

1234
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:55,199
BF like there was a North American Union that ended up happening

1235
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Because text

1236
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
This is so bullheaded they're like

1237
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
They are

1238
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Things that link

1239
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,415
You have one

1240
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,999
Little in the middle

1241
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:14,399
United States from Mexico California

1242
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:20,799
One of those assholes living in Canada jubilo

1243
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,615
Well I could just go to this non-government

1244
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
Because I'm staying

1245
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
I'm test

1246
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,991
Basically admitting that government is a good thing

1247
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
I don't know if we're

1248
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
Going to come to a resolution to this but it is more fun than talking about Aaron Russo

1249
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Arizona

1250
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Dollightful

1251
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Enjoyed it many times

1252
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Times of my life

1253
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
I love you

1254
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Okay

1255
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
In this next week

1256
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
Shocking

1257
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,799
Revelation of Arab Roussos that comes

1258
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
From

1259
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Mysterious

1260
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
Nick Rockefeller

1261
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:59,199
Specific about when you met Rockefeller

1262
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
Rockefeller

1263
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
Call me up Wednesday and said

1264
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,487
When the Rockefellers like to meet you I made a video call medha cell

1265
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,559
Amazing video

1266
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
I know I was running for governor Nevada

1267
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,887
Shut up to me

1268
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,263
Is very very smart man

1269
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
We should talk and share ideas and thoughts

1270
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,223
He's the one until 11 months before

1271
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,015
911

1272
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,063
And there's going to be an event

1273
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
Never time with you that was going to be

1274
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
There's going to be an event

1275
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
The Caspian Sea

1276
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
We going to invade Iraq

1277
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,263
Enough to take over the oil fields established a base in the Middle East

1278
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,823
And make it all positive World Order

1279
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,383
Chavez in Venezuela

1280
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Sure enough

1281
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
Play the 9/11 happen

1282
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,783
He was telling me how

1283
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Sea salt

1284
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,903
Looking in caves

1285
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:16,511
Some people is in Afghanistan and Pakistan in all these places

1286
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
Another thing is a giant hoax

1287
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,495
You know it's way for the government to take over

1288
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,799
The American people

1289
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Oh yeah

1290
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Oh yeah

1291
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,551
9/11 happen

1292
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,343
And then nothing's happened since then

1293
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
Nothing

1294
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,231
Here's the problem with this

1295
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,887
But also nothing happened since is a ridiculous thing

1296
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Argue

1297
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,727
And if you're just saying it over more planes

1298
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
I don't know because

1299
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
Insecurities got clampdown real f****** hard

1300
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
Now the other thing is

1301
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,407
All of the household became hack

1302
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
All of the stuff

1303
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,479
But he's saying in this interview

1304
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
In 2006

1305
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,295
A stuff that has happened

1306
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Since 9/11

1307
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
He's just using

1308
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,671
His awareness of what has happened since then

1309
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:23,071
And pretending that he knew it 11 months before seriously didn't tell anybody before 9/11

1310
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:29,471
Years

1311
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
911

1312
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
Didn't tell anybody

1313
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,591
And then brought the story out mysteriously around this

1314
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:38,175
The time that he released a movie called America freedom to Fascism

1315
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
Weird

1316
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,015
And he has two million dollars in tax lien

1317
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,087
Has a vested interested really trying to sell this movie

1318
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
How do you sell it

1319
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:51,231
Know a secret Rockefeller guy

1320
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
Therefore everything

1321
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
Must be based on

1322
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Totally real stuff

1323
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:01,727
New York Times review of the documentary from freedom to Fascism

1324
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:06,591
Near the film's beginning Mr Russo says and others appear on in a serving

1325
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,151
Did the IRS has refused every request

1326
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:13,247
Restore any law making Americans liable for an income tax on their wages

1327
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Yet

1328
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,367
Among those thanked in the credits for their help in making the film is Anthony Burke

1329
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
And IRS spoken

1330
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,791
Mr Burke said that when Mr Russo call them asking what law required the payment of income taxes on wages

1331
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,583
He said Mr Russo at like 2.

1332
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,655
Including title 26 of the United States code

1333
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Siding display

1334
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Pacific sex

1335
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
Require income tax

1336
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
We paid on wages

1337
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
Title 26 says on its face

1338
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
That it is a law enacted by Congress

1339
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,895
But Mr Russo tonight

1340
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
Just completely lying about you do also review also include that Bette Midler she could have best picture

1341
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:54,975
The film also includes a brief interview with Sheldon

1342
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
Who was an IRS commissioner in the Johnson

1343
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
Administration

1344
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,119
Cut mr. Cowan said the mr. Russo use

1345
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,423
Twist My Views to create a Folsom

1346
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,031
So you get the sense that there's multiple people who were involved with this

1347
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:13,663
F****** stupid documentary that he put out who have come out publicly and said

1348
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
It's very clearly

1349
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,503
Answer the question he asked and in the documentary

1350
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:22,879
Oh no one will respond to my request and give me documents right if someone else comes out and says

1351
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,183
Hey this guy lied about me using editing

1352
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,743
And now he's coming on Alex Jones Show where they

1353
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Credible

1354
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:34,399
Reputation is a truth-teller

1355
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,935
It's completely under of viable

1356
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,311
About a guy named Nick Rockefeller who doesn't even appear to be a member of the Rockefeller family

1357
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
Using him because

1358
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,967
Before

1359
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,343
The deaths of three people

1360
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,743
Diddams gray what a crusade Bush for not stopping it based on prior intelligent

1361
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
What the f*** did you do

1362
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
Also why don't you tell Alex Jones

1363
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Back then

1364
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
Why don't you do something

1365
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
Scream about it

1366
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,727
Anyway

1367
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,055
Is a big old con man

1368
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
So foundational

1369
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
Alex Jones

1370
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,455
This worldview that definitely deserves

1371
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
Being talked about

1372
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,063
Now there's a lot of other stuff in the interview that

1373
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,111
For the sake of time we don't really have

1374
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Time to get into

1375
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
But

1376
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
Suffice it to say the rest

1377
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
You say

1378
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
Brave pronounce

1379
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
About the warranty

1380
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,727
Warren Tire is a fraud

1381
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
It's a farce

1382
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,055
It's very difficult to say it out loud

1383
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Cuz people are intimidated

1384
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
Again sang

1385
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,919
Do you say they want to make you a donut case

1386
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:54,527
What's with the truth with the truth has to be the truth has to come out that's what I'm doing this interview

1387
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,831
The fact the matter happens to be

1388
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,135
The whole War answer is a fraud

1389
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
It's a farce

1390
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
That's a joke

1391
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
Again

1392
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,727
You could have gone to any protest

1393
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:21,151
You said the war on terror was a fraud

1394
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:25,503
The news media would be like

1395
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,527
I disagree

1396
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
Aaron Russo said

1397
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,279
Is a very common

1398
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,839
Very middle-of-the-road position

1399
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
In most

1400
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
Liberal

1401
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Communities

1402
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,215
Free dating 2016

1403
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:51,103
So the war on terror in the fridge

1404
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,919
I'm just saying that as a larger

1405
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
As a large

1406
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:59,295
Concept during this time I remember clearly that so many people who are like

1407
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,391
This is bulshit

1408
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,719
I don't I don't think it makes it hard to say

1409
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,815
Of course

1410
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:17,215
Him on Alex's show but at the time if you'd there were plenty of people

1411
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,751
By coming out and saying that this

1412
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,711
Pay for my teammates a repeat

1413
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
I don't know

1414
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
Anyway

1415
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,111
We get some more news from the Rockefeller guy

1416
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,903
About women's lib

1417
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:48,959
I'm pretty conventional thinking about

1418
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Just like they won the right to vote

1419
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,615
Idiot

1420
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,223
He said you won't let me see what that was about

1421
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,063
Refunded women's lib

1422
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
No

1423
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,415
Newspapers and television

1424
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,279
He says anyone who wants to do two primary reason

1425
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,655
We couldn't accept the population

1426
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
Probably legitimate

1427
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
The second reason was

1428
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,543
Get the kids to school tomorrow early age

1429
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
We didn't talk to me the kids have a thing

1430
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
Tickets at look at the state as a

1431
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
The family

1432
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
As a school as the official

1433
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,343
As their family that is the parents teaching

1434
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:43,487
And so don't

1435
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
Was

1436
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
So we all know the public school didn't exist

1437
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,351
Before women's lib

1438
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
So there's that

1439
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
Yeah but

1440
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
Tangischools

1441
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
The kindergarten app

1442
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,591
Kindergarten

1443
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Kindergarten

1444
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
Where they where they guard children

1445
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,015
I would I would say

1446
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
We funded women's

1447
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,463
Well I think you look back on it like after I even just as another example like after Margaret

1448
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
Singer it already been

1449
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,559
We are putting her Crusade for Women's Health

1450
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,655
For years and years with no help Rockefeller Foundation

1451
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:29,055
Did come in and find her a little bit later so you can

1452
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:33,151
You can probably find examples

1453
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Support

1454
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
What causes

1455
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Board game

1456
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Endowment

1457
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:42,623
Stuff like that to people like Margaret Sanger throughout history

1458
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,463
But that doesn't mean that they funded women's liver was something fake thing

1459
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,279
Right now you take the example of a fake thing

1460
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
You have people like Edward Bernays with his

1461
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Campaign

1462
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Smoking

1463
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,727
Is a fake co-opting of women's lib

1464
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
Typo

1465
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,079
Like the bigger picture of it wasn't that

1466
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,871
Aptitude to

1467
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
Much finer point

1468
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
This is

1469
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Grossly patriarchal

1470
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
Like this sort of idea that you selling

1471
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,623
Because women's liberation

1472
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
Was a noble thing

1473
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
And then he just

1474
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
That

1475
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511
Men should rule the world

1476
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
I guess

1477
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,839
But like even if I call

1478
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,423
Want to go along with the idea of

1479
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
To have kids

1480
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,495
I should have a career

1481
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,823
Rob

1482
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Those people

1483
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Prospective

1484
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,407
I think

1485
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,711
Rockefeller funded it was all these

1486
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,247
Elites that I'm imagining

1487
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,551
Push this through

1488
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
It takes away a lot of the agents

1489
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,135
Actually did fight for change

1490
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Entirely

1491
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,351
Global jobs

1492
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
Again

1493
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
He's not calling them globalist

1494
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
Just interesting

1495
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
These next two clips

1496
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
We get to hear Aaron Russo Stacy

1497
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Stop

1498
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
Familiar

1499
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Okay

1500
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
I'm going to I'm just going to tell you this up

1501
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
Front

1502
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,247
I hope it doesn't color the way you

1503
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,015
You hear this clip

1504
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
But I got

1505
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
When I was listening

1506
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Because I believe

1507
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
What he's about

1508
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
To say

1509
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
Alex has stolen his bed

1510
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,839
I I think that three men and a hot tub

1511
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,143
Yeah that would be amazing

1512
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
3 minutes

1513
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,751
Globalist

1514
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,823
Alex Verdugo

1515
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Aaron Russo died

1516
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Shortly after that

1517
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,199
And he just took it on his own back

1518
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,039
Because it's very familiar to us nowadays

1519
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,855
But I mean I don't know

1520
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
Extra life 2004 2000

1521
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
5

1522
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
I don't know

1523
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
His

1524
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,023
But I imagine it wasn't

1525
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Just comes from

1526
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
I never really

1527
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
Did that because

1528
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
That was when I was coming from

1529
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,543
As much as I like you Nick

1530
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
You know

1531
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,895
You always in my ways with the other where the opposite side of the fence

1532
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,199
You know I don't believe in sleeping people

1533
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
Will be more like you know

1534
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,415
What's more like you know

1535
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
It was like

1536
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,839
What do you care about

1537
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,399
What are you sure about this

1538
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
What did he say to you

1539
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
To give your own life

1540
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Do the best you can for you and your family

1541
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
What is the recipe of Nancy Dominicans you

1542
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
Richest service

1543
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
The people

1544
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,551
You know it was just a lack of

1545
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Caring

1546
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
You know and that's just not who I was

1547
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
It was just sort of like

1548
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,207
Cold you know I was just like

1549
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Cold

1550
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,023
You know and

1551
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
I said what

1552
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,071
The point

1553
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
You have all the money in the world

1554
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Disappoint

1555
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
So you here

1556
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:18,175
That's silly

1557
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:23,295
I hear they're him talking about how Nicholas Rockefeller was trying to recruit him in

1558
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
So many

1559
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,623
They're trying to recruit him

1560
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:32,767
Because I don't want to disrespect the humanity of other people next clip where I talk about even more

1561
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
This is even more familiar

1562
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,911
Maybe

1563
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,703
Say this in the ballpark

1564
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,751
Successful business

1565
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,823
And I sold the truth what was happening

1566
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
I tried to express it to the people

1567
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,711
Express the people they want me to join us

1568
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,247
Already

1569
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,551
Already we could have been Glenn Beck

1570
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,367
Or

1571
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:04,767
Million dollar movie theater he's already been offered tons of movies

1572
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,815
That to me

1573
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
The trying to get me in but I don't want to do it

1574
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
So is it moving to shaker

1575
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
I'd rather them

1576
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
It was real simple and

1577
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,639
He tried to recruit me into that situation and

1578
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:29,599
Already I have to think that

1579
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,903
First of all

1580
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
Because his

1581
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
Responsible

1582
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
So anyway

1583
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
My thing that I'm amazed that right

1584
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Alex

1585
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
2006

1586
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,519
Asking leading questions he's not he's letting his guests

1587
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:54,431
He's doing it be references interview

1588
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
He references they had a conversation the night but

1589
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
Before

1590
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
Before he told him some of these

1591
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
Bombshell

1592
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,135
Jesus

1593
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Step on this

1594
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
I'm going

1595
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,487
To get a fake Rockefeller story

1596
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
One time you said to me

1597
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,863
New Jordans

1598
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
And your triplesafe a on it

1599
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,055
Simmons kiss my ass and anybody stops you

1600
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,103
Can you show them your car dealership

1601
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
Cuz one of us

1602
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,319
You know and you know what why you fighting for the people for what was that about

1603
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:36,671
The people just you know that they have to be ruled I have to have to be

1604
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,743
The Constitution what you staring for

1605
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
Is only for a few people

1606
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
So if you want I can live that way

1607
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,399
You know and we believe that

1608
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
Asbestos iety

1609
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,519
People who are

1610
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,567
What's a syllable

1611
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,615
This is so allocation

1612
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Yeah but then

1613
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
Are you fully

1614
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,783
Going to put kma on you

1615
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Alright

1616
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:09,695
Getting an offer like

1617
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,231
Yeah you'll be one of us

1618
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:16,607
Why do you care about these Jeep these Lemmings that is obviously

1619
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Please do it like a f******

1620
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,447
Put badass motherfuker on your wallet

1621
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,471
The same

1622
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:26,591
Bulshit that there's a badass motherfuker

1623
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:35,551
How many people were selling the laminated

1624
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,743
I have a postcard that I

1625
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
What

1626
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
What was that the phrase that you're out of there

1627
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,935
The Phrase That Pays

1628
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,007
Perfect example of something that I definitely

1629
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
You watched

1630
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Like

1631
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
10 years ago

1632
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,639
Or something like that 78 years ago

1633
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
This energy before

1634
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,223
But knowing that what I know about Alex now

1635
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
I saw through

1636
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039
Completely new eyes

1637
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807
Lake

1638
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
Story

1639
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
To me was

1640
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Horrifying

1641
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Because I know

1642
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,975
From other looking into

1643
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Betty the liar

1644
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:21,375
And then I know what Alex is sold about his life story since then

1645
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
So I

1646
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
I have

1647
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
Really strong

1648
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,263
That what happened was

1649
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
This is Aaron Russo

1650
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Pretend

1651
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Bet

1652
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
If you are, cuz his bed

1653
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,223
You know he's not super mainstreaming ever got on

1654
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
Comedy Central

1655
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Something like that

1656
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,575
He dies a year later I'm going to

1657
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:44,415
Do that bet rather good bet that's a great B Williams

1658
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:49,023
The idea that the globalist have reached out to me and try to get me to join their team

1659
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,559
Explicitly

1660
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
That's a good fit

1661
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,887
And he's just stolen that bit

1662
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
It's a great bit

1663
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,591
Absolutely

1664
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,663
I'm not sure Alex had the money in 2006

1665
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,223
People

1666
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
Sort of bulshit things

1667
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Russo says

1668
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Before we wrap this

1669
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
What's up

1670
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Even message me once

1671
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
No problem trying to solve Israel

1672
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
Palestinian problem

1673
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
Any talk to me once about

1674
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
I'll bring Israel to Arizona

1675
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,383
You know until I got ideas ruined

1676
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,455
The State of Arizona

1677
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
Believable

1678
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,255
That's pretty wild I like that

1679
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:58,655
I like that Judaism just being like

1680
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:02,495
Pagar Holy Land is actually Arizona

1681
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,799
Are bad guys it's also

1682
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
Kind of insulting that it's like

1683
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,503
Bucket

1684
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:19,135
That's almost anti-semetic and like that the

1685
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,463
Not consider in 2006 the population of Israel was

1686
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,255
7 million people

1687
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,303
Italy 2 million dollars

1688
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,863
Put them in Arizona as millionaires

1689
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,703
And does that will somehow fix the israel-palestine

1690
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
Does it

1691
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
I mean

1692
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,407
You know what they're a lot of ideas you don't know are bad until you

1693
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:48,831
Cuz first of all Give Me a Reason.

1694
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,647
The people who believe in Israel the most

1695
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
Aggressively

1696
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,231
Would never take that deal

1697
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
Because it's not about like

1698
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,607
Bob just being like a we can have Arizona great

1699
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,935
It's not about that it is about the holy land that exist

1700
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,495
Fair traffic Lee Bass

1701
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,311
Even if you got rid of that say 2 million

1702
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,407
Of the seven million people that are still going to have a lot of people

1703
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
Still

1704
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Enforcing

1705
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,295
Apartheid government

1706
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,647
Yeah it's going to come into money

1707
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
That even if you have

1708
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
More than that

1709
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Much more than $1,000 per person

1710
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
Number is called

1711
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,519
Millions of million trillion is $100,000 per person

1712
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:44,127
So I get there

1713
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,663
It's not important

1714
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
This is all bulshit

1715
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
But

1716
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
I got some stuff

1717
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,295
Ikenberry issue would be then

1718
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,855
What are you doing bringing 7 million Warp

1719
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
People into Arizona

1720
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:59,487
How is that going to affect the demographic

1721
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,839
Certainly Arizona is famous for

1722
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,167
Loving Jewish people not even saying from a demographic

1723
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:11,775
I just mean adding 7 million more people into a state

1724
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,311
Where to throw everything into

1725
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:19,968
The chaos that are in Israel

1726
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
That's including Palace

1727
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,136
So I guess it would be all of them

1728
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,768
2000

1729
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
Depopulation

1730
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
Arizona weather

1731
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:41,728
Do you double the population

1732
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,544
Is it caca maybe nonsense

1733
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,128
The idea that he's playing that Rockefeller

1734
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:57,600
Makes me believe they Rockefeller Mike's big guy likes to talk s***

1735
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,744
Is part of the elite faction because of his last name

1736
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
I like

1737
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,120
I really like that

1738
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,424
I like that idea is fiction

1739
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
Like that

1740
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,800
Great alternate history fiction book is instead of

1741
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:20,128
Instead of after the Holocaust we create Israel's estate we're just like

1742
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
Arizona

1743
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,296
Desert

1744
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:32,416
Another investigation of a

1745
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,488
Infowars

1746
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,304
Sharply into Focus

1747
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
At no point

1748
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,912
During

1749
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
Any of this interview

1750
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Aaron Russo

1751
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,288
Or Alex Jones

1752
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,080
Bring up George Soros

1753
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
In any way

1754
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
They don't reference him

1755
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:59,552
That is a good point they don't talk about him at all

1756
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,880
This is a time when Soros

1757
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,440
Was not a thing that I was thought about or cared about

1758
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
Interested in all Rockefeller

1759
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:13,376
Ford Foundation perhaps maybe I'll get a plug-in there it's interesting to me that you have someone

1760
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Reporting is being on the inside

1761
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Knowing a

1762
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
Arch globalist

1763
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:23,360
Family member and having the invitation he's coming in and spilling the beans

1764
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
And at no point

1765
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Does Soros

1766
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,456
The open Society Foundation

1767
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Come up

1768
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
At all

1769
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,784
No wonder why

1770
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Interesting

1771
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,344
I wonder why

1772
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
Fascinating

1773
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Right

1774
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,928
More on that 2 coming out

1775
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:42,560
I don't actually know the answer to this question but it's right

1776
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:46,656
You know it's based on Alex Jones his own reporting of his

1777
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
Skeptical history

1778
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,264
They should absolutely be like what you know about Soros

1779
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,664
Collaborator

1780
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,272
2006

1781
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,064
He didn't rank is b*******

1782
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
Bulshit

1783
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Use

1784
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,488
Involved in funding Foundation

1785
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
July 10th 2006

1786
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,792
Nonsense

1787
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,632
I want to learn more about it but it's f***** up

1788
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,216
This is if anywhere there should be a fingerprint of Soros

1789
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,240
On Alex's fan

1790
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:26,080
It's when he's interviewing this guy who told him he knew about 9/11 ahead of time

1791
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,104
Probably

1792
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,152
You would think that the

1793
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:32,736
You would think that stores would have been like the main Boogeyman from the

1794
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,600
You would think

1795
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
Through 2015

1796
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,976
And do that whole long-ass investigation

1797
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:48,864
If Soros then comes up it seems like there would be a corroborating Infowars of Messi

1798
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,400
During that time of like

1799
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,472
Well we looked into the Rockefellers religion before foundation

1800
01:23:53,984 --> 01:24:00,128
And we found another guy we found behind some reason instead of a narrative

1801
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,992
Emerging whole-cloth out of nowhere

1802
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,320
Understand what they actually said

1803
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,112
He just thinks like oh I'll

1804
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
Take that sound bite

1805
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
Of

1806
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,488
No money all of it went to

1807
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:20,096
The interest consider waste

1808
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,120
Went to

1809
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
Did something

1810
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,240
Very debatable

1811
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,336
Debatably

1812
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:35,712
And you can see that even in 2006 I was hoping we'd go back and he'd have a much more strong grasp on

1813
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,272
On information and stuff like that but no

1814
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,088
He's playing the same fast and loose game who does with the

1815
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,112
With stuff now

1816
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,416
So he can

1817
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:47,744
He doesn't have the

1818
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Not at all

1819
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
Globalist

1820
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,448
Imaginary

1821
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:01,568
Right right

1822
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,872
Exactly

1823
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:10,016
If you like our show you can go to our website

1824
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:13,088
Underscore that's correct also we're on Facebook

1825
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,416
You can go to iTunes

1826
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,720
Downloader

1827
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,448
Send it to the internet and tell people about

1828
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,336
Tell the internet people give yourself a return address

1829
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,664
Rate internet

1830
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,688
Absolutely

1831
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,760
Baba baba baba

1832
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,552
I'd like to say

1833
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,368
You'd like to say that you'd like to say

1834
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,464
I want not for Aaron Russo to be the first new self

1835
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,768
To f*** himself

1836
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,584
I got the feeling that Aaron Russo wasn't the guy

1837
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,632
He's a conman for strep

1838
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:06,080
He should f*** himself on some level but I do feel bad that he died

1839
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:10,688
Immediately

1840
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
No he's been diagnosed

1841
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
For years I think

1842
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
The stakes were lower

1843
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
To come on Alex's showing

1844
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Say crazyshit

1845
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Woodside

1846
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
Maybe

1847
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
I mean Reagan's in the running

1848
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Alright

1849
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,400
Holding

1850
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:36,288
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work
