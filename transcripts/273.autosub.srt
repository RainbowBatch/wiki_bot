1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,320
Forget a grave what are you talkin about getting pumped up Elementary School

3
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Okay I'll give you a

4
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Ariane memorable can remember that I didn't deserve it all

5
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Michele Weaver

6
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,704
I dropped out my senior year of ice

7
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
But I also skip

8
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Like

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,848
Two-thirds of my junior year

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
Halo mask

11
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
In that time of course

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,272
Expelled

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
I showed up and took a couple of the finals I took my French fry

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,464
Final

15
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
You got like a 98% on the final I'm just going to give you credit for the class

16
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
Cuz I was one of the only classes I actually

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Did show up

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Cool

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
I could handle that depressing

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
High school was a

21
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,088
Broadcast

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
Now I'm producing the show

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
I don't know

24
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Could

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,080
I was just channeling my inner Pierre

26
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,992
Monumental episode to go over that will cover the days

27
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808

00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600

Rays baseball score

31
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Of the very infowar

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,288
And there's a lot of things we can speculate about what it means

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
Wyatt what's going on

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Is that

35
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Quite a ways down the road

36
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
But before we get to today's episode I'd like to give a shout out

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504

Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
To support the show

53
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840

54
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144

Dealing with Chicago real estate

60

00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839

Is it crazy

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
It's a lot of

67
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Lunatic nonsense

68
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
And here is an out-of-context drop

69
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Today Show

70
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
But here's how well we start things off on March 5th

71
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
March 5th 2000

72
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
I'm your host Alex Jones

73
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,175
Herein

74
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
And political coverage pants

75
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,135
Here in our new state-of-the-art studio and got through my stereo share now

76
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,327
What are you about to drop

77
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,703
Al-shahristani blockage but we are moving forward thanks for your prayers and your support

78
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Studio

79
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,871
I've been working on for a really long time

80
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,711
I don't know

81
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,831
24-hour

82
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
The style.

83
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,327
Football

84
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,703
Football

85
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
Network

86
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
Well you got like what 3 hours of David Knight

87
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
3 hours at 4 hours

88
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Maybe it's two of David Knight

89
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
How far of Alex in 28 hours total

90
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
I mean Weldon 20 hours is a big jump

91
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,743
20%

92
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
You know what even better

93
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
Just put your toes in the water there

94
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
See if you got somebody who can step up

95
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
I mean I believe you have a new studio

96
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
About that be almost ready for a really long time

97
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
But I believe they finally finished I've Studio

98
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Going to go to 20 hours a day

99
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
I think that's just a brass for a long time

100
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
But the fact

101
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Westlake

102
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
Beginning off of all of these platforms ever

103
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Rolling back

104
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
Talk very openly talking about how

105
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Getting kicked off of like Spotify and iTunes really hurt him

106
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Fidgets

107
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
Through mediums like that and when you just rub that information

108
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,535
They don't think about it's like all I can remember to listen to the nobody goes to the second page of Google

109
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,607
Right word at

110
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
You're more likely to listen to it

111
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
And when that subscription isn't there

112
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Messerli going to go to the web

113
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,151
How much money has

114
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Who have lost

115
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
From all of that going away

116
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
It's it's huge

117
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Studio

118
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
Strikes me as blustery nonsense

119
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
Clear indication that he has some sort of benefactor

120
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,007
Dark money or an angel investor

121
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
I found a bucket of gold

122
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,711
You might just find right

123
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
That sort of thing strikes me as that

124
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Being a possibility

125
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But that's not the most important

126
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,487
Don't doubt that at all

127
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
The most important

128
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
The intro to this episode

129
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
I should tell you

130
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
The most important thing

131
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Is it Alex

132
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Is wearing a cowboy hat

133
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
Dog cowboy hat

134
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
And

135
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Set reminder

136
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
And about

137
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Can you put a cowboy hat on

138
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,071
And shortened put a cowboy hat on

139
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
We know from listening 2000-2010

140
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
Alex is mr. Watson Brothers I believe

141
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
No longer occupied Texas

142
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Visiting Austin

143
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,951
Having to hang out with Alex

144
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Was a lot of possibility

145
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Number one we could be speculative

146
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Almost

147
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Never leaves the United

148
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
Yeah we almost never comes too often I think in the time that I've been listening

149
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Maybe

150
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Twice before I've seen him,

151
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
Emagine Lakeville

152
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
More

153
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
So he's gone

154
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,535
Edward still Alex Mike

155
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
Call

156
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
Or there's a very simple explanation that Paul was it

157
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Come hang out with Alex

158
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Pay face service

159
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Paul Joseph Watson

160
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
No he was like Laura Loomer and all them just hanging around which the argument that he was coming for that

161
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Yeah you talked about how I pack as much cock

162
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Like the sort of thing that would get him out of the United

163
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,679
I'm playing but there's a lot of possibilities

164
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Could mean something

165
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Or could just be

166
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
You coming to TPAC

167
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
I'm leaning towards that doesn't mean

168
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Well we will have to see

169
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
Sonia

170
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
So

171
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Pornography

172
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
Would you believe

173
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Cuz that was Tuesday night

174
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Stop no it's not about that Alex bolsonaro the video that he tweeted later

175
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
So Alex is a big story

176
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
The UK that he wants

177
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
Talk about that have to do with them

178
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
Have some thoughts about that

179
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
But I was about to say

180
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Is stupid

181
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,863
Infowars.com as well

182
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
Blocks all p***

183
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055

The national move in the UK

187
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Call freeporm is really

188
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Systems

189
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
This is the plan

190
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
I told Sam to couple years ago

191
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Talking about it

192
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Old is just old

193
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
You pay the government

194
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,615
And then they put software on your computer that watches what you do and you give them your ID or passport

195
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Dumps like a truck

196
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
The publicly you're going to opt into a dossier

197
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,279
Search.

198
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,143
You turn on the television

199
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
A shot works

200
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:02,591
How did you got another partner in the bedroom with you it's called the British government

201
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
It's coming here this is the model

202
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
Is that a three-way or how many people are in Parliament

203
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Very few of whom you would want to be in bed for the novelty

204
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
He's a bit chunky for my tape

205
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
The UK isn't

206
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,407
Blazing age verification system

207
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,271
By proof by providing your license or passport in order to access free p*** sites

208
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
P******

209
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,231
Has the cookies in their browser will retain that verification and not require it

210
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,375
To be put in every time they click on a new p*** site

211
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Nobody

212
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,311
I'm not going to that

213
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,687
There isn't a software that you put on your computer

214
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Part of this

215
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
Although I think it's a little bit of a clunky sister

216
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,391
Like if you have a shared computer your kids could still easily slip through verify

217
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
Your browser there other ways that it's pretty obvious

218
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Ways these get around this but that's not really the big issue

219
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
The big concern I would imagine would be privacy

220
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
If you give the government a passport

221
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
I decode they can obviously track all the poor you look at

222
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Scary

223
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Luckily

224
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,591
The government thought about that and offered another one

225
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Get an age ID

226
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
From an article in the Sun

227
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
As well as registering with hid

228
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,087
Exit p******** using High Street shops

229
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
Shops will offer a special ID card

230
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Known as Porta

231
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Airport email address

232
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
There's an anonymity

233
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
Target

234
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
One of us 1000 shops

235
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
In the UK

236
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
Built-in

237
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
The program to provide a layer privacy

238
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Well still ideally working towards make

239
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
It harder for kids to find

240
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,879
I don't think it's worth while I think you're fighting an uphill battle

241
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Insanely easy

242
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Define p***

243
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Hey if you want to

244
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Like back in the day when it was much harder when they were just

245
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
Stuff that you can wander into the forest

246
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
Yeah it was easier to restrict access to

247
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,639
If you still want to make it a rule that they stuff

248
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Is prohibited to people under 18

249
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
Need to come up with a new novel system

250
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
To to be able to do that

251
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
Because functionally it's not a rule

252
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,559
When I was 16 and they have that little ru18 yes or no

253
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,239
Is going to your sting operation my name's not there

254
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
You just click on something

255
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,063
It's just them covering their

256
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
And not them actually stopping

257
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
It's the

258
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
I get it I get

259
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
I get it but I also

260
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
It's probably ineffective but the arguments

261
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
A creating a dossier of B

262
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
People's habits and stuff

263
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
They have

264
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Parson

265
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
The system that are in place

266
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
Specifically to assuage that

267
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Concern

268
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
I suppose the only thing that I would say my only take on this

269
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,087
Which is look whatever you guys do whatever you feel is right

270
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
From reading all of human

271
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
History will find

272
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,911
You will not defeat p*** no matter how much you fight against how much you struggle

273
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
Drive

274
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
Towards sexuality section

275
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Expression

276
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
No matter how much

277
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
To try and repressive

278
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Whatever for

279
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
Spike's what are the books that the church band

280
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
Got around in Europe during the you know

281
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
1418 there whatever it

282
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Is there was a massive

283
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Bring up p*** distribution

284
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Just end it was just like

285
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
Weird illuminated text

286
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,935
It was so huge that

287
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Stuff like a

288
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Literally the Bible with people weren't even allowed to because that was restricted was also being sent along

289
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
With tits

290
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
You know like all of that underground distribution

291
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Periods to route

292
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Street history

293
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,719
His always also been like you're describing is a piece of

294
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
The Vanguard of speech has been on

295
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Metaphor

296
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
To fight

297
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Too hard

298
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
On menu

299
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,247
Front

300
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Especially the times for the Trident terms of government becomes like this

301
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
Confusing. I know it when I see it like that

302
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
I will tell you that a video of somebody peeing on somebody in carnival while they jerk off

303
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
That's probably why would say that

304
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
I don't know if Alex is that the UK isn't

305
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Just trying to stop

306
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
Kids

307
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Would that lead you to believe

308
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
Because he knows more about

309
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Okay

310
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,327
Government of the UK or the US government

311
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Asinine

312
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Aggressive promotion of homosexuality

313
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,479
Muslims

314
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
I just

315
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,183
Lgbtq

316
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Sexualizing

317
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
Officially adopted

318
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Nokia bolsonaro is

319
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,007
It's all for a while

320
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,407
Let's let that out.

321
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
The story that Alex is talking about school in Salt Lake or salt leave Birmingham

322
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
The UK

323
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
We're students are being taught about lgbtq

324
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
The goal of curbing homophobia early in their lives

325
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
This application program was being taught by a man named Andrew

326
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Who interested

327
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Out of all the teachers in the world

328
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,239
Who is on a surprise

329
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
Best teacher in the world

330
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943
There were over 10,000 dominis from 179 countries for this honor and he's

331
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,039
Best teachers in the world

332
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
Program called No outsider

333
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Unfortunately he ended up getting

334
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,399
From Muslim and Christian parents who felt that his program was sexual

335
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,263
Just kind of indication could have used the program like moffett's back

336
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
Outback license Drive

337
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
He was quoted in the guardian

338
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,015
We've got to find a way to engage.

339
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,391
Yes at the moment we're having challenges in my own school but not running

340
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
What alternative is there

341
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
So

342
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
You have this situation where there were a bunch of parents

343
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
You complained about this program that was

344
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
2

345
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,216
Promote tolerance and I will go on record as saying that

346
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,360
Should I understand their position and they should also go f*** themselves

347
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Christian Perez

348
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,200
Complained

349
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Muslim parents

350
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Because it wasn't a largely

351
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Muslim

352
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Part of it is kind of

353
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Superfluous

354
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,256
To it just being religious.

355
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm sure the study I'm sure the people writing the article definitely had their own little bit of

356
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
It was Muslims

357
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,312
There's a little bit of that there

358
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,664
The school ended up kowtowing to the

359
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
The pressure

360
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Curriculum

361
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
So I mean

362
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
A tickets I think

363
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
Terrible

364
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
The problem solved

365
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
I mean that program is kicked out of school

366
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,584
So

367
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,936
Piece of s*** right

368
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
Operating

369
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Schools programs

370
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,128
But because these Muslim people made a big stink about it

371
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
They were allowed to get out of the

372
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Pro

373
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Yeah like the parents

374
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
Muslim

375
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
To say

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,424
Teach your daughter and your son

377
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
About

378
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
But

379
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,088
Radical Islam

380
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
We're going to put a dress on

381
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
This is how the whole left the system works total

382
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:43,104
None of that is true

383
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,480
And I was curious about this idea is putting forth about the idea that just recently

384
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
Muslim grooming gangs

385
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
I got arrested

386
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
Pedophile

387
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
The child abusers who have been arrested

388
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
By groups of child

389
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
1 stories

390
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
Woman being arrested

391
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,520
Epoch times ran a story about 33 man being arrested for sexually abusing children between

392
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
2002 1000 in West Yorkshire

393
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
Who's the only big stories he can really find

394
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
From recent times about England

395
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,040
And groups engagement

396
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,880
Neither of these stories include any indication or even insinuation is to

397
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
The race or religion

398
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Persuasion of those

399
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Piece of the equation

400
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Right-wing manipulation

401
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Of a serious issue

402
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
For political gain

403
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,984
There's a vast majority of grooming Behavior Asian individual

404
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,848
The demographic category in the United Kingdom that involves people have Middle Eastern

405
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
Report put out by the think-tank quilliam

406
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:56,576
Show the 84% of grooming gang offenders are quote of Pakistani origin with Muslim

407
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,440
This is accepted as gospel by people in these uniformed dekuyper nationalist

408
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Looks like Tommy

409
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Anna Moses

410
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
Usher

411
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,656
However people reviewed the report has found some serious problem

412
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
The largest is replies under is not a legal designation that exist

413
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,688
The behavior that it describes Faith child sexual exploitation

414
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
To be counted as any number of offences

415
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Is the Pentagon

416
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Investigatory

417
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
Yeah so it goes to like what was actually

418
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Are you conspiring to

419
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Two prostitutes

420
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Somebody

421
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
Alright

422
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:42,912
According to the guardian Nazir afzal is the crown prosecutor Services formerly Don child

423
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
Prosecutor

424
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Most responsible for bringing down grooming gang

425
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:51,616
The media he observes pounced on cases involving Asian

426
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
But often ignores those involved in white

427
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Surprise

428
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
They go on to point out that an offender's ethnicity

429
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
His alternate only recorded when they're non-white

430
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
Which makes more complicated

431
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,232
58 cases of grooming gang arrest

432
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
Between 2005 and 27

433
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
The problematically

434
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,168
The child exploitation and online protection Centre found 57

435
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
Child sexual exploitation arrest

436
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,128
Squilliam

437
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
The group regressive left media did it

438
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Completely Savage takedown of the study

439
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
Which cuts through all the problems

440
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Definition

441
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Sources methodology analysis

442
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
And everything else about the report

443
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,976
Including links to stories of over 100 White perpetrators

444
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
That match quilliams data requirements work

445
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
Completely ignored by the report

446
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
A list

447
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Less than half a day yeah that sounds

448
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
They just completely ignored all this

449
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,664
So if you are a f****** propaganda

450
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
Ellicottville and a lecturer in security and crime science in an expert on child sexual exploitation

451
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
The fuc

452
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Phone

453
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
He's going to make fun of names no I'm just saying that that's that's like a weird nowadays determinism kind of thing where your name

454
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
Game of Thrones

455
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,432
Put out this report out of a desire for funding and if that's the case

456
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,832
$20,000 from Sam Harris over $1000000 in a grant for the John Templeton Foundation

457
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,928
Interesting Lee appear reviewed study in association today

458
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
Sounds that the Templeton Foundation

459
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Was part of the network of Foundations

460
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
The quotes supplied fun

461
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,888
To the five organizations involved in actively mobilizing tea party activist

462
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Templeton even finance a group

463
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
Called Let Freedom Ring

464
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Which is deeply involved in

465
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,640
Tea party activity and Templeton Junior the head of the foundation was listed in

466
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,432
2011 Mother Jones

467
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
As being among the donors allowed it

468
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:09,600
Add a Koch Industries seminar as haven't given over $1000000 to cocoline causes

469
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
Nothing else that would be enough to know he was in

470
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Evil Pizza

471
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
By meeting with his Dad who started the whole Foundation

472
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
The junior is

473
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah be more active in a lot of this stuff

474
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,680
This is the Overton window

475
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,520
Billionaires Finance organizations

476
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Extremists like Tommy Robinson

477
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
So they can work to distract the public from working to actual

478
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
We sold the world's biggest problem

479
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Namely that there are billionaires

480
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
But I think was probably the most important part about all this

481
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Is the victims voices

482
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
That are lost in the shuffle

483
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,768
They're basically just being used as props by these bigoted to run their Auntie diversity scam

484
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
And that is a treasure

485
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,656
The independent random piece in March 2018 written by woman who survived

486
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Kidnapped and abused

487
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Rotherham

488
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
Grooming gang

489
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
And I think her perspective is one that Alex

490
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,408
Mainland Europe

491
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,272
Conflict surrounding immigrants and refugees has been fueled by stories of women being raped by migrant

492
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,904
People have been calling calling for violent action against war on Islam

493
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
As someone who's experienced licensed I can tell you what's

494
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
None of this is likely to make a difference

495
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Did the behaviors of groomers

496
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:29,216
Like terrorists they firmly believe that their crimes at the crimes that carry out are justified by their religion

497
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
If anything

498
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,104
Probably make groomers stronger in their conviction

499
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
And drive ordinary young Muslim man towards fundamentalism grooming gangs

500
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
And terrorism

501
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,320
Of course my main perpetrator quoted scriptures from the Quran

502
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
However almost identical scriptures

503
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
About the stoning to death of Virgin so don't scream when they're right

504
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Can also be found in the Bible

505
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
The problem is

506
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
The text itself it's how it's fundamentally

507
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,704
In fact

508
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Spy terrible

509
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Human Injustice

510
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,128
People from Africa violence towards lgbtq

511
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
All the major world religions including Hinduism and Buddhism

512
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,112
I've also at some point but sometimes human rights abuses against children

513
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Why does my

514
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
Terrific religiously sanctioned sexual violence

515
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,096
Torture so I definitely need to be aware of religious extremism

516
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Potentially harmful

517
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
So that we can protect people from it

518
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
But for Tommy Robinson and his followers to focus on

519
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Anti religion

520
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,872
Based on a cruel misinterpretation of some scriptures by some people

521
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
Is unhelpful to say Valley

522
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Many of his religious theories and

523
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
Conjecture or not I can relate to

524
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
In my real life

525
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
.

526
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
So

527
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,952
Is this idea about grooming gang

528
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
Is generally used as propaganda against

529
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Muslim

530
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Based on this

531
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Origin

532
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Dubiously written

533
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
Report by the quilliam faked

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Have experienced this

535
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Have a different

536
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Perspective on it

537
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Then people who

538
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,200
Like Tommy Robinson are trying to create a career

539
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Out of fighting against

540
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
Using

541
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
People like the Survivor as a shield from criticism

542
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Try to stop the theoretical

543
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
Epidemic

544
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Caused by Muslims

545
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
Do you just really want to hate me

546
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
Fury

547
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,800
And you know is the thing that makes it even more obvious

548
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
The whole reason behind the

549
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Lgbtq

550
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
LG

551
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,576
Goddamnit I cannot

552
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
LG

553
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
The point the point being

554
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
He is saying like

555
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
This program

556
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
2

557
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,352
Lgbtq community

558
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,168
It's clearly teaching them oral sex

559
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
Which is like no you're obviously obviously signaling that you're real problems going to hold off on that Converse

560
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
And possibly fix that peoples

561
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Identities are intrinsically sex

562
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
Yeah cuz it's the only way that Alex

563
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
I understand that

564
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
Take a note

565
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Marla blow somebody

566
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,264
Regular ice cube f****** Maxim magazine

567
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,104
I think what he's doing is gross

568
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
I think that when you look

569
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Realities

570
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,552
Talking about it becomes more clear how gross it is yeah and when you read the stories

571
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
People who are in fall

572
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
It's very tragic

573
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
Real issue

574
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
But you're never going to solve the issue if

575
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
You focus on just like

576
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,304
Is all Muslims doing it was Crackdown on Muslim

577
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
And stuff like that

578
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
There are groups

579
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Child exploitation

580
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
You just have to deal with that

581
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Reality

582
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
And then work on

583
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
On how you feel

584
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,408
Like it is not a religion it's not the

585
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
Fuller going to find a way to preserve

586
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Anytime

587
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,648
Into something that can be used as a bludgeon towards people that don't like

588
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Literature classes

589
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
Workshop

590
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
Adjust from like reading a book

591
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Like you read I don't know why I keep bringing up a Hundred Years of Solitude on the show

592
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,592
Workshop settings

593
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Even that you sit down

594
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
The books

595
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
You bring something

596
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Different to it

597
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
And you can interpret

598
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
The even novels

599
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
Profoundly differently than somebody else

600
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
There's only one book that I think everybody interpret

601
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
It's the same way

602
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
And that's A Separate Peace

603
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
Have you ever read

604
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
It's a book

605
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,872
That everybody pretty much interprets as being terrible

606
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay

607
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Bed bug

608
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,528
The same thing you said about gorilla mindset

609
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
So it is actually really good

610
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,208
You read it your likes you but then later on

611
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008

619
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
You're putting forth about you

620
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Interpreting

00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Real gross

625
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,296
It's Muslims they're upset

626
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
What about

627
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Sadomasochism

628
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,864
Heard about sex changes in children have you heard about

629
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Fisting

630
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192

00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Cabool pedophilic assault

632
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,384
Social engineers

633
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Can you imagine that

634
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Can you imagine

635
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
Anybody being like a child

636
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600

I just

641
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
It's weird it's very weird

642
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,224
Like I really

643
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
Like listen to that get bummed out by sexual preference

644
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
Like the the word sexual being in there

645
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
As opposed to a is not divorced from

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,584
F****** s*** is f****** for him

647
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,776
Misconstrued by even

648
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,080
Bright

649
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
Disentangle in his mind

650
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Do you have that anyone would

651
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
People about

652
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Like gay people

653
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Existing

654
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
Like them having conversation we're like

655
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
It's fun.

656
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
What

657
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:22,560
What do you imagine

658
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
It can be fun to suck dick

659
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
But not all the time

660
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Indoctrination

661
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
PowerPoint presentation

662
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Yeah

663
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,784
It's not it's not

664
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
It would be like my guy almost Nara I think he's got some link

665
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
At whatever next clip Alex gets super

666
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
As we discussed earlier

667
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
Diaz

668
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
He's putting forth

669
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
About that

670
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,336
Complained about the Muslims can get out of this

671
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,176
Gagan doctrination or whatever

672
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,528
Deseret Industries

673
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Complained about this

674
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,904
He's now decided that Muslims are real cool

675
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,584
This is one of okay support of the weirdest

676
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
And I don't think he's going to be able to keep this up

677
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,264
But it does tell you where his truest bigotries lie

678
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
I'm going to say it right now on air

679
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
I take my hat off

680
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
Ahmad Muslim Community

681
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,136
Because they're the only group consistently protesting and saying no

682
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
The children as young as 3 years old

683
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,816
The boys are girls

684
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
Pedophile

685
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Pedophile

686
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Colt runs in UK

687
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
So I salute

688
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
Muslims in the UK

689
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Her being better people than the average British citizen

690
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,784
Better than the police above the government that's what about that

691
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
That is weird

692
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
That is really weird

693
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,744
Sufficiently homophobic

694
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,840
Jeff creating false versions of

695
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
The UK Muslim Community

696
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Yeah

697
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
You went from like

698
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,104
A week ago being like Muslims throw acid in people's faces and they're the only ones who kill people to be like

699
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
Heathrow Kings of Build-A-Bear Cisco

700
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,696
It's so f****** terrifying to continue listen to this cuz this is present-day Alex

701
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:03,840
Like you want to live in 29 in 2019 and thanks was this week

702
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
Done with your b*******

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
And it's like nope

704
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Still there

705
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
If they'll f****** there all the times always

706
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
I promise you there's no like greater context

707
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Activist that makes it make sense

708
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Parents complained about this

709
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,576
Tolerance program this school and now he's decided

710
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Muslims

711
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,160
Play

712
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
Beautiful

713
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Islamophobic rant

714
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
You did that birthing couple years back about going to suggest kicking all those ones out of the car

715
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Country

716
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
What the f*** is this what are you doing

717
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
It's nonsensical

718
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
Well you got to give it up to the Somali pirates

719
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
You got to give it up to him

720
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,784
Like I said you was talking about the grooming gang stuff

721
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
Earlier this address

722
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
And

723
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
He said something in this next clip

724
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
I have to say it maybe

725
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472
Stop at 12 year olds

726
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,568
Why

727
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,920
What what what

728
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,528
Confidently say they've stopped at 12 year old

729
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,136
Nothing

730
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,464
There could even be a headline

731
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,120
I don't see any reason why

732
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:46,496
I don't get what he's doing

733
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
What kind of lunatic would be like well

734
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,919
We got to figure out the age of these child grooming gangs quit so

735
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Headlines

736
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Grooming gangs usually stop at 12 there's super into exploitation and kidnapping

737
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
When people fight

738
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,719
We have limit can't do it

739
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
Well that's good

740
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
This is crazy

741
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
This is nonsense Nana's and I don't understand

742
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,615
Really what the point is

743
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
Is his anger at Muslims

744
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Conditional

745
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
His discomfort and

746
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Very serious problems

747
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
The gay community

748
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Lgbtq community

749
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
Is not Paramount

750
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,695
Yes I think that is what we can take

751
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Solidly

752
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,559
Positive

753
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
Within days he will start yelling about

754
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Undoubtedly

755
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,543
Brief moment where it almost seems like he realized

756
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Is that Christian extremist

757
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
Like himself

758
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Have far more in common with

759
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:02,271
With Muslim extremist possible with anybody else

760
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Hey man

761
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
You want to do lunch and I want to kill people too but at least looking both

762
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,839
I'm up and make Society super press

763
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
Possibility

764
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
Just trying to troll for like media attention

765
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,311
Somebody picks

766
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
Isn't this voter yet

767
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,183
Yeah something like that

768
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:50,911
Joseph Watson

769
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,567
More boring than just a good that happened

770
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,895
Alex has another big breaking story

771
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
Have to do with

772
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,807
Like to talk about

773
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Trump derangement

774
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Syndrome

775
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
And that is

776
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Trump does

777
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
Is no good

778
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Snowflakes

779
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,535
If we've seen anything since the mid

780
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
It's that there's a far larger

781
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Proportion of media figures

782
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Especially

783
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
That have

784
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,103
Syndrome

785
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
I think one of the main reasons

786
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
You can really eat their what

787
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,319
In the sense that like she engages on social media and dunks on people

788
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
Pretty regularly better than they are firewifi like propaganda

789
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
Duncan Robinson

790
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,823
A big scoop about

791
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
And I have a scoop about that scoop

792
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
It's not a scoop

793
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,159
That I really don't want to just put it out there not giving attention

794
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
You will

795
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
And

796
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
Everybody's really excited right now.

797
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
Yeah you know me

798
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
The Creature from the methamphetamine with gun

799
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Everyone is just so excited that she

800
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,391
She didn't steal a million

801
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,463
I went in this morning when I saw it in the SEC record

802
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,071
Federal Election Commission records

803
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,895
Of course her and her business manager pocketed Millions

804
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Totally legal

805
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,783
The first thing I would point out is that

806
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Well first of all

807
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Has not been

808
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,183
I read I read some of the story and immediately it was

809
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
I'd like I read the headline that I read a little bit more and I was like oh guys you are really trying ever

810
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,911
Read They're throwing everything

811
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,519
We especially the con artist variety on the right

812
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:40,639
Find SEC data about the funding of AOC campaign

813
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,735
Considering their hard records

814
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,087
Little more than two billion dollars NetSpend

815
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
Approximately

816
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
Smile again for the campaign

817
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
The amount even raised by political 1590

818
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,119
$2

819
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,471
Also I have no idea what records from the Securities Exchange

820
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
I don't know what that has to do with it

821
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
No

822
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Amazing amount of b******* right there looked at stock record

823
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,767
Sure

824
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
Really strong indication that he's making stuff up records

825
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
About her campaign fund

826
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Alright buddy

827
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,519
So

828
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,103
This is all just part of a right-wing smear

829
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
Finance

830
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,295
I don't pretend to know everything and if the in the next few months there any indications

831
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
Brazen

832
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,951
That's what they'll be a problem and I'll take I'll take that when that comes when there's any proof

833
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
It doesn't appear that they did

834
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
From the information available

835
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
So the issue at hand

836
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,631
Is that psychiatry

837
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:11,007
Brand new Congress and one called Justice Democrat

838
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,335
Campaign LLC

839
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
What is the temperature

840
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,175
Public about this was

841
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,991
Create a system where would be possible

842
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
They don't have to spend all their time fun drive

843
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Fundraising

844
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
To run for office

845
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,767
The Pac-12 send some of the money to the LLC

846
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
Which would provide the services

847
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
Candidates

848
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,703
Worry about the elements of running for office that often keeps qualified candidates for me

849
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
Inconsiderate

850
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
This is a new fundraising bottles

851
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,663
But their lawyers have added what they do and aboveboard

852
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:56,063
Found that to be accurate whenever they came up with the idea

853
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
Utterly and completely public about hey this is our news

854
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
We're letting you know way up front

855
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
Verse same day we started and we told you

856
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:20,639
Chakrabarti appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show to discuss fundraising strategy on May 18th 2016

857
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,967
Exactly

858
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,015
Grimm the DC bureau chief

859
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
The intercept

860
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
Looked into it back

861
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,415
In 2018 and found their practices were all above board

862
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
On some

863
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
We will chat

864
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
At least you're now Justice Democrats

865
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,631
I've had a post up on their website explain how the process works

866
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
Discussing the legal standard

867
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,983
And highlighting how the money is

868
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,055
And why the system needs to be set up like that in order to

869
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,175
They're very transparent about that

870
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,759
What happened to the Alex. Sensational article in the Washington time

871
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
And didn't realize that it was

872
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
Was just a smear based on something

873
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Explain two year ago

874
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
This is sloppy s***

875
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,327
But it demonstrates how are you today

876
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,119
Derail her abilities Beyond

877
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
Especially the oversight committee people not want someone like her

878
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,919
Get her you can't take her down

879
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,759
Take her down she's not

880
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,063
The Democratic Party

881
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
People who

882
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Are long-time career politicians are dangerous

883
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,047
Is as well exactly

884
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,447
Do you have a part of the reason that the Centrist Democrats are aligning so hard with Republican

885
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
Yeah at least appear to be inclined

886
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,807
Their capacity is

887
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Vegan

888
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
Position

889
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,207
Screw things up for a lot of people who posted for a very long time

890
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,535
And as much as Alex likes to pretend

891
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,607
But he's above the rigmarole on the bric-a-brac

892
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,959
He's very beholding to a lot of those things

893
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Because he

894
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,775
Define some salt as opposed to it

895
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,847
Yeah it what is mainstream

896
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
What does he do

897
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,199
How did he stay in opposition to the thing

898
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
That is what Maine

899
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
Extreme culture turns into

900
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
Completely

901
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,391
Morrison

902
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,743
The people who he complains about you you hate the status quo

903
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,327
And that's your status quo

904
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,471
420 brand is against

905
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
X yeah

906
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,055
If exchanged

907
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
That's hard

908
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
Do that

909
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
So Alex

910
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
It turns out also this is this is pretty good

911
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Does pretty good information

912
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
He missed a production meeting

913
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Before this may

914
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
March 5th episode

915
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
I don't think

916
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,191
Define dubious about.

917
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,983
The way he describes his

918
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Is processed in this next clip

919
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Is so amazing

920
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
Someone tried to

921
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
Describe it this way

922
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,551
Tries to take their advice and described it as virtue

923
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
That kind of thing

924
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,183
What makes them

925
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Good

926
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
You'll see what I

927
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:51,071
And I just didn't get here for production meeting this morning show

928
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,631
Want to move face to tomorrow if we don't have that

929
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,191
It was the same story yesterday on

930
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,239
Animal producing now live on air

931
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
This is totally transparent television

932
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,223
Wonder why

933
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
The same talking points every show from

934
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,343
It's just corporate guys right up here

935
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
And then they put it out

936
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,839
And that's what they do over and over again so that's why it's so boring

937
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Reply it's so stale

938
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,959
You know it's not spontaneous that's why

939
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,775
The first time

940
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,663
Because people are

941
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Hungry

942
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
For reality

943
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
I love reality

944
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,623
Those other places prepare due-diligence

945
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
Warriors before

946
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:06,335
Yeah sure Alex multiple times

947
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Google X

948
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,943
It's important Alex

949
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
But he gives Rogan

950
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
First appearance

951
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Was the biggest of all time

952
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,231
That is true compared to his first one

953
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,887
But neither of them are even half of the downloads on YouTube

954
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:35,775
I don't either I don't care I don't even I don't even want a I don't even want to mention that pettiness

955
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,359
Because his pettiness is insane and it's once again

956
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
An example of him

957
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,687
Clearly telegraphing that he

958
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Used

959
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,855
A man who thinks he's his friend and he is not

960
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,183
Call myself because he does bring up

961
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:58,815
Elon Musk episode did better than his first episode but now this new episode

962
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,119
Alex is about 9 million

963
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,679
Downloads

964
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,471
Of the new episode

965
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
Elon Musk

966
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
2 / 20

967
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:14,431
I know I know I know I know I know

968
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
I'm preparing this episode but

969
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,551
Comparison to the amount of research

970
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
John to prepare the

971
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
A prepare research

972
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,607
I did 30 minutes research on that stack

973
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,191
I get hours of research on this.

974
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
Previously in the currently

975
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
I don't know that mean

976
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:44,639
But also if you like and you only do I like

977
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:52,319
200 pages of articles

978
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,767
All of the claims that are presented in it

979
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
Find out who are the people

980
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,447
30 minutes

981
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:15,615
Go f*** yourself Alex

982
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:20,991
I ran out of time so I only had 30 minutes to prepare updates

983
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
Because they've never looked

984
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,367
So it's

985
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
Yeah

986
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
Added a bunch of research on this.

987
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
And so I'm here

988
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,559
I'm just telling you that

989
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,447
Dolittle

990
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,847
I completely forgot to

991
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:53,247
That was his audience or people

992
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,999
30 minutes

993
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,911
Who is who plays HR his father why doesn't Alex make eye contact with me

994
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,007
Busy doing research

995
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
He's just trying to make make things right on it

996
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Things that little love

997
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,815
Diza is talking to the producers now video

998
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:44,959
You're rambling this is nonsense go to a video adrenochrome

999
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:51,359
Bright

1000
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:57,759
Me nude what are you talkin about

1001
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,575
The only way that it's not

1002
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:04,927
Oh my God

1003
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,023
I got to get my house in order

1004
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,607
Got to do 30 minutes of research on my stack

1005
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,727
Play this on Rogan show.

1006
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
To Brogan wouldn't let him

1007
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
Because

1008
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Dickie head

1009
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,895
Like the beginning of the video is a clip from Fear and Loathing

1010
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
Where they talk about

1011
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,671
30-second skip past it

1012
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
And he's really proud

1013
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:44,863
A liter of quarter of children

1014
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,191
Back to the bloodline looking

1015
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
You want to know why that's bulshit

1016
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:54,847
And then take another step further past that realize that Hunter S Thompson wasn't writing realshit

1017
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,687
Another step back

1018
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,783
From people who have done it

1019
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
Really ineffective

1020
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:10,463
Thompson was real journalism

1021
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Gary Hart being an addict

1022
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
280.

1023
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Existed

1024
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
And weaved into

1025
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
Of the hyper

1026
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,167
The realistic version of

1027
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Fear loathing

1028
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Makes complete sense

1029
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,223
Dogs

1030
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,551
But if you want to just watch for your love

1031
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,623
I've seen it a few times and that 20

1032
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,183
17 minute 20 years

1033
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,511
Been a long time

1034
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,071
Don't miss it

1035
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:25,471
Me too I do like

1036
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:33,663
He does really get a chance to shine he doesn't make any sense

1037
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:44,415
That's everyone's in snatched

1038
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,791
There's a poster that looks like a poster for snatch

1039
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
Has Benicio del Toro part of my memory

1040
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,031
That time that I worked at the movie

1041
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
It's something

1042
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
He was in

1043
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
The post

1044
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Very close

1045
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:11,039
Was he one of the

1046
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
Original High Skies was wearing the

1047
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,023
I'm going to

1048
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
Going to be the worst moment of my life

1049
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,775
Dance on your face

1050
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Traffic

1051
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Know that

1052
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:46,111
Frankie four fingers

1053
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,695
Myself

1054
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Got a check

1055
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:59,167
Next movie after

1056
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
Could have swore that he wasn't instead

1057
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,823
God dammit

1058
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
Wolfman

1059
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,431
That was not a great one

1060
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:15,551
She could have swore he wasn't immediately remembered after I said if Eddie was

1061
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
I'm so sorry

1062
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:23,487
Does gasliter gaslighting in action you made me think that there were

1063
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:28,863
Another poster that I was thinking

1064
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,703
Next clip

1065
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:39,103
Bring up the names

1066
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Obviously

1067
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,015
Means the face gold which is horrible

1068
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
Sign of things to come at Faith Goldie's in the mix we're all in trouble. No one's doing great yeah

1069
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Pack and breastfeeding

1070
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,351
She comes on the show we're not going to listen

1071
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Too much of her

1072
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,655
But I will say that

1073
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
You go back and you listen

1074
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
To her

1075
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Appearance

1076
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Is she speaking in a lot of code

1077
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Real

1078
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:20,063
Yeah yeah yeah

1079
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:26,463
It would it would end up as being like let's listen to 20 minutes of her her interview

1080
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
I didn't think it was worth it

1081
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
I feel like we can take that as read

1082
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Did she has sort of

1083
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
Neo-Nazi

1084
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
Leaning

1085
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
We talked about that a ton before

1086
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
I think it's more interesting

1087
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,983
That this is how Alex

1088
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Decides

1089
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
Start their conversation

1090
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
Little bit inappropriate

1091
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
I wanted to get you on because

1092
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
You're doing what's really

1093
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
Really

1094
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Faith

1095
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
You are going after

1096
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,831
The Shootist

1097
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Lee's Chicken

1098
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
Republican

1099
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,463
Establishment or really just Democrat

1100
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,631
Twitter right now in the show Mountain View

1101
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,447
But you don't class two beautiful women together for smart women

1102
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,775
No. Right now

1103
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
So he's like

1104
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
Married

1105
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,991
F****** gross that's inappropriate

1106
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
Unbecoming

1107
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
Of someone who tries to

1108
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
To pretend he's Hesperia

1109
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,415
8

1110
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,047
That episode we talked about with Katie Hopkins

1111
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
It's like that stuff

1112
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,167
It doesn't even seem to indicate the

1113
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:45,055
So I'm not going to Alex's Behavior

1114
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
Inappropriate

1115
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,175
8 is 1 of those things on the right-wing they're like

1116
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,415
These Republican

1117
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,975
Beautiful

1118
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,303
I love

1119
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,119
It's it's crazy and then you get a little something

1120
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:14,239
Daddy is again the idea of how you shift over

1121
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:20,895
Look at it like it's so important what you're doing and that's going against the Republicans that aren't hard enough

1122
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,991
Crazy as we want

1123
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,783
National

1124
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
We need

1125
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
The people who were sort of milquetoast on the fence

1126
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
To be forced

1127
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,743
Take the position that they don't walked in order to save their bases

1128
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,791
You are doing that and you

1129
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,863
You're hot if people like it that you're doing it just like Jan Morgan

1130
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
Very exciting for him

1131
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,935
So

1132
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,007
Isn't that cool if Alex talks about her time at CPAC

1133
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,615
I'm not sure that she comes in on this cliff

1134
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Too much

1135
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Complaining

1136
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
This is wild

1137
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,759
Express in the same breath

1138
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,807
That he doesn't have a problem with people being

1139
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,647
Gay but also that there's too many gay people in the GOP

1140
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
Which is hard that's a fine line to walk especially since that line doesn't exist in your just a

1141
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,959
Homophobe isn't good at

1142
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
He's not a good typewriter

1143
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
Is him trying

1144
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Swell

1145
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,687
Jake Lloyd

1146
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
Democrat

1147
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,535
What about your pillow

1148
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,631
Homosexuality issue

1149
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,935
The Republican Party

1150
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,775
What's this song

1151
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:56,639
I don't understand what he's trying to present because if you just take him at his word

1152
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:02,527
Too many gays live in there

1153
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:08,927
Right blackmailing with the idea that they're in a relationship

1154
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,767
How is everyone

1155
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,047
Bite the pillow

1156
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:17,887
So you guys come and be on our side on

1157
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:24,287
I thought it was crazy cuz that democracy was a sexually transmitted disease

1158
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:30,687
Express is homosexual blackmailed by intimate partners with Athens

1159
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:37,087
Committed relationship

1160
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:42,207
Monogamous

1161
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:48,607
Facebook it's complicated

1162
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,447
Oud seed

1163
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
Cricket

1164
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,567
Please try to express his nuts on its face

1165
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,127
And then it's even more nuts but he's trying to

1166
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
You say that like

1167
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Outlook

1168
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,735
If you say you don't have a problem with

1169
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,015
Like people being

1170
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Lgbtq

1171
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:13,695
But that you also say we have a gay problem in the GOP I really feel

1172
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,535
Listing the same space

1173
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,583
I actually do have a wave

1174
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119
Can have that conversation

1175
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
But

1176
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
It's not the way out

1177
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
How can we have that conversation

1178
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,799
Well if we accept that there are a lot of gay p

1179
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:33,151
People closeted in the GOP

1180
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:38,783
Maintaining cover of being or having a beaver part of the LGB

1181
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Community

1182
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
They have to

1183
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,903
Make compromises

1184
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,975
Subway dzar

1185
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
LGB

1186
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
It's that

1187
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
They wouldn't

1188
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Be accepted

1189
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
Were they

1190
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
Live publicly

1191
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,191
In the political sphere

1192
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
So the issue isn't

1193
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,847
There's a gay problem that problem

1194
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:06,431
Yeah

1195
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,295
Also gave lesbian

1196
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,623
Is Alex is talking about that then his position on this

1197
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
Totally different

1198
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
It would be

1199
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
We need to all be more accepting

1200
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
People of different

1201
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
It's sexual proclivities

1202
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
As opposed to

1203
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
To being like

1204
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
Too many of these f***

1205
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
GOP

1206
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
The f******

1207
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,495
Seems text Democrats and get blackmailed

1208
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,055
F****** weird

1209
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,359
That is such a weird thing

1210
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Okay

1211
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:39,199
So our problem isn't that they're gay

1212
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,039
Our problem is that gay

1213
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,087
Can be blackmailed by

1214
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
Partners

1215
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,159
Because if they were out

1216
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,463
We would not accept them in the GOP

1217
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,095
Contingent

1218
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
Exactly

1219
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,215
Hallucinating a larger problem

1220
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:09,151
But you're still at that

1221
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,855
Entire interview

1222
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135
And there are tons

1223
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Of like

1224
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Zales

1225
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
He's talking about

1226
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,839
The problem

1227
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Call them the globalist

1228
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,215
Finish prattles off like a joke

1229
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,263
Relations of

1230
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,079
Existence is there also

1231
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,615
Code words

1232
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
In order to

1233
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
One World Government

1234
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
The protocols

1235
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
Typo

1236
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
Tough interview n

1237
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,695
And I think space like

1238
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
I think this makes it clear distorted

1239
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
What you saying

1240
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,839
We all have to do our part because

1241
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,191
They try to take

1242
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Chuchua Grassroots

1243
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,775
A truly Grassroots Revolution

1244
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,055
Which means to return

1245
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:14,175
The old order there's absolutely nothing

1246
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
That's right in the old order is the New Order of Renaissance

1247
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,623
Nice 2500 years

1248
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,927
These demon and lizard

1249
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,767
Those really consider what you got you got the demon

1250
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Which is something that Alex

1251
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,447
Andy's classic

1252
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
Related

1253
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Blizzard

1254
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,079
That's f****** faver-dykes characterization

1255
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:47,455
The characters who he pretends out real in the protocols

1256
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
Pictures of f****** believe there's lizard

1257
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
To be like

1258
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,999
We all know what we're talkin about the gap

1259
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:08,447
Would be something that I would even be willing to entertain is if she tried to coat it be like

1260
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:14,847
Lizards

1261
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Break

1262
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,991
Like if she if she bucks back

1263
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,319
Defensive

1264
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
To learn from

1265
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,391
Faith criticism

1266
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,975
Different conversations

1267
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Jordan in the next

1268
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,607
Rodger Stone

1269
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
Isabel

1270
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,871
Wednesday

1271
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
He does have a

1272
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,175
Securing on Monday

1273
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,223
I would say I think

1274
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
Bb8

1275
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
73

1276
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Percent chance U

1277
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,623
I'm going to be so mad if he doesn't go to prison

1278
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
I'm not to be mad I'll be surprised

1279
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
It'll be like a

1280
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:26,015
Oh my God so I told you already that Rodger can't be on the wall

1281
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,831
Alex is kind of pissed off about that

1282
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
Talk about it

1283
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Shroyer

1284
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,631
You sent me a text message

1285
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Especially the end of this morning

1286
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
The Goblin

1287
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
He said that too

1288
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,895
Sad and

1289
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,735
So I can send

1290
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,295
Private conversation

1291
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
People on

1292
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,879
Flexi-Rod group

1293
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,207
Is the

1294
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,047
Rodger getting a gaggle

1295
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,863
Control Rogers narrative

1296
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,215
Like entirely absolutely

1297
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
He just texted me said I love you man

1298
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,567
I love you

1299
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
He's going into fight the Goblin

1300

Or whatever

1301
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,687
He can now shape this exactly how he wants

1302
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
This is a win

1303
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,831
He doesn't have to deal with Rodger trying to beg for donations on his show which was a huge sticker

1304
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
Hey now

1305
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:51,007
Yep Rogers become the person that he can go to and say all they didn't allow me to have a pencil in there so I'm

1306
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:56,895
Just going to tell you what he said what is a pencil

1307
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:03,551
Control of Rogers narrative

1308
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,183
Anymore

1309
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975

Rajaton f****** text him I love you I'm going to defeat the Goblin

1311

They're going to murder me and it's because you betrayed me

1312
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:35,039
Text me that he loved me the other day Alex you're not fighting hard enough for me I'm going to get Travis Irvine to come up there and kick your ass

1313
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:40,415
I hope you go down with me

1314
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,231
Rodger texted me that you love me the other

1315
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
You son of a b**** was on there and tell everyone that Randy credico a g

1316
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,191
Like I've been trying to get

1317
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,239
Get on get on it

1318
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,079
Jack Rogers

1319
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,151
F*** that must be a real weird relationship

1320
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,223
Complete control over it

1321
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,295
Confront and that is awesome power.

1322
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,391
So navigate to the point where Paul Joseph Watson shows up

1323
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
Forbath

1324
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,951
Call Noel

1325
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,535
I hope I hope he gets hit by a truck

1326
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,375
I'm talking about how

1327
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
Real

1328
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
Real week

1329
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
But this next

1330
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,151
Illustrate

1331
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,431
Perfectly their

1332
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,063
You get technocracy connection

1333
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
Completely

1334
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,255
Basically

1335
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,119
People have access

1336
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
To everything

1337
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
This is the army

1338
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,175
And I say level connections everything

1339
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:10,015
Represent the idea that like if you're a good globalist

1340
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,135
With the system and stuff like that thing

1341
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,303
Like his blackheads

1342
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
Embarrassed

1343
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
The only reason that I think I clipped

1344
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
I'm telling you something

1345
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
That's how

1346
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
Look at me

1347
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
We're not lying this

1348
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,927
Time you are to default

1349
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Conversation

1350
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,999
And you will sometimes

1351
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:52,767
That

1352
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Look at me

1353
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:04,799
But here's what I'm about to say

1354
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,103
A number of times

1355
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
I love it I love that dynamic

1356
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
Because it's it's first of all abusive

1357
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
Been there for f****** ever so you know

1358
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
He knows what he's

1359
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
So much money

1360
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,439
Like if you consider the salaries

1361
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
Time for like a course

1362
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:28,607
How much is Paul making

1363
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:34,751
Yeah it's it's sickening the very least enough to afford a flight to Austin

1364
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,799
Take money for what does

1365
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,871
And for remarks of Lights Austin

1366
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,175
Pretty expensive even from Chicago

1367
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,735
Malone from

1368
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
Old

1369
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Yes

1370
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,343
So

1371
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
He's talkin

1372
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
Censorship and how

1373
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Conservatism

1374
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:01,375
Under attack

1375
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,935
Where do I find

1376
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,823
I find perfectly boring and I don't want to talk about because I just don't care

1377
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,895
Most of the time it relies on

1378
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,039
Twitter or or whatever Antichrist

1379
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Trackdown

1380
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
A million different

1381
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Threads

1382
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
Help

1383
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,719
Right I just

1384
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
It's not

1385
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,791
Even if

1386
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Even if every

1387
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,399
Is true I'm still not convinced that I care

1388
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
Yeah I don't

1389
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
I'm going to leave that all aside

1390
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,823
Because Alex said some really f***** up things

1391
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,383
Studio

1392
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Appalled

1393
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,687
Is totally fine with

1394
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,015
The first one isn't all that sucks up but it is a little

1395
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:56,671
Backpack

1396
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:01,791
And I watch Tammy Allison or or New Wave hookers

1397
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:06,655
New apartment

1398
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
CeCe he's not poor guy also he was caught with p*** open I know I was going to say go f***

1399
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:23,552
Kind of matches with Alex's psychology Arrested Development

1400
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
Where the younger you would pretend

1401
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,392
Call

1402
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,864
The real thing

1403
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,472
F*** off

1404
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Kind of

1405
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,056
Mcmeme the story

1406
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,384
The idea that

1407
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
Revealed on air

1408
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,200
And all that stuff

1409
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
It's Debbie Does Dallas

1410
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,832
So in this point we get back to

1411
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
Did AOC narrative

1412
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
Alex

1413
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
Is going on

1414
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
With Alexandria ocasio-cortez

1415
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,080
Dinesh D'Souza

1416
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,896
I'm Batman

1417
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:32,672
Number 2 documentary

1418
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
And they're really upset about him going in the 2016 election

1419
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,352
Thousand dollars

1420
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,912
They said it wasn't listed properly on Federal Form

1421
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
You're welcome

1422
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,520
I got the article right here we can show TV viewers

1423
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,616
The shoes

1424
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,272
Cortez

1425
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,952
Years ago

1426
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:12,352
Millions of dollars

1427
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:18,752
He's trying to conflate the idea of these like justice Democrats Ryan.

1428
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:25,664
Champagne

1429
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,320
So there's a few problems

1430
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
And their similarity

1431
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,416
The first thing is

1432
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
That's the fur

1433
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,792
Problem what Dinesh D'Souza explicitly a felony

1434
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
What AOC did was

1435
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,704
Completely legal it was the brand new Congress and Justice Democrats

1436
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:56,640
Also they were worried about Dinesh D'Souza in the 2016 elections so they did

1437
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
They put him in prison

1438
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
That's absurd

1439
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,528
Since he was charged on May of 2014

1440
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,184
Also District 2016 election before any of the primaries really egg

1441
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,840
They had psychic powers

1442
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,936
Play the guilty

1443
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,288
Because he knew that he would have played play the victim card in the court of public

1444
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,104
But he could only play the role of

1445
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,176
Court

1446
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,760
Right

1447
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,040
Minimize whatever sentence

1448
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,600
These are completely different scenarios

1449
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
Is right

1450
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
This is a demonstration of how his brain work

1451
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,120
Connecting are not related at all

1452
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
Conundrum

1453
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,288
The Republican is not Republican

1454
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
5 faces with Trump

1455
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,640
Trump has committed campaign violations

1456
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,688
Trump has broken the emoluments clause

1457
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:08,064
Trump has committed all kinds of crimes that are well and very obvious

1458
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
So4

1459
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,904
They have to try and create a what about

1460
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,560
So like this okay

1461
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:23,424
You're more right than you even

1462
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,264
No because

1463
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,664
LLC registered by

1464
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,736
It was registered

1465
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
Delaware

1466
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,320
Pretty regular thing

1467
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,160
Delaware

1468
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,936
Yeah

1469
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:01,824
Corelife

1470
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
In Subway's

1471
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,432
Insult

1472
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,200
Even better serve

1473
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Alex Newell

1474
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,272
He was talking about

1475
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,296
Vet like

1476
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,064
Hey

1477
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
You know

1478
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,744
Michael Cohen established an LLC in Delaware specifically

1479
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,144
Except even more

1480
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Make

1481
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,936
Cohen couple

1482
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
Look you know but it's like you avoid that

1483
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
He's already established

1484
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:37,408
What's the narrative where it's all cullinan

1485
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,808
They're all just bad at like Ira I read so many things

1486
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,856
Oh did you guys know

1487
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
Feds

1488
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,208
Aoc's campaign advisor

1489
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,256
Millionaire

1490
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
Guys

1491
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,352
If you're pathetic

1492
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,144
Actually went to production

1493
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
And I was in

1494
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
Be doing a much better job

1495
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
That's what I would say

1496
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Yep

1497
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
So we got to stop giving advice

1498
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
This next clip

1499
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,920
I only included because Alex does Bernie Sanders

1500
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
Because I'm Petty

1501
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,992
So let's get through it

1502
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Talk about

1503
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,808
The hypocrisy because

1504
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,624
Tommy's in socialist never owned a factory

1505
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:25,280
Just steal money Paul like like

1506
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,864
White people

1507
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,424
IDrive hundred-thousand-dollar vehicles

1508
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,776
Bernie Sanders has written at least

1509
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:41,920
I was going to say also that's from Of Mice and Men

1510
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,456
But it's pretty close to his burning

1511
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,016
Paul Joseph Watson finally

1512
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,064
You haven't heard

1513
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
He's there he's blooming in

1514
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
The wings cuz I don't want to ever hear his voice

1515
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,720
Not over Skype

1516
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,280
I'll tell you that

1517
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,584
Not over the phone

1518
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,400
But intersex

1519
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
He thinks he has a god

1520
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
About to Alexandria Ocasio

1521
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,800
Cortez radar

1522
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Good if

1523
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
Because on its face

1524
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
This is a bad wreck

1525
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Reputation

1526
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,504
But let's another break-in Scandal by AOC

1527
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,296
Which is a complete

1528
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
Fight new story

1529
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:24,928
She's tweeted the Jerry Falwell basically wanted to kill a Muslim

1530
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,512
This is President Trump's fall Orange

1531
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
This common

1532
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:36,448
From folwell did not

1533
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:41,312
Cloud

1534
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,224
Alright Paul

1535
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,832
Tall

1536
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,648
You are missing the forest for the trees

1537
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:04,352
Also they said the Trump said the n-word over and over at CPAC with that's not true he said it at my place

1538
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:10,752
A couple of weeks ago same level of like that I'll like it like it was in a c-pack

1539
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
Okay I understand and Jerry Falwell Jr

1540
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
That it was

1541
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
Good shoot

1542
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,576
Right if more people had come

1543
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
Concealed carry

1544
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,928
You could stop those Muslims before they

1545
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Did blank

1546
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:36,352
And then he fumbled over his words by him as he was speaking

1547
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,800
Because what he was trying to say obvious

1548
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,104
Terrorist

1549
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Whatever

1550
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,432
Right came out of his mouth

1551
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:57,088
Because those words exist in the same part of his brain

1552
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,624
Criticisms that are being made about

1553
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,744
If more people had concealed carry guns they could

1554
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
Until Muslim

1555
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
Before they douche

1556
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,584
Exactly that is a part of

1557
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:14,240
What is autopilot

1558
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,568
Sure that we put a good picture

1559
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:21,408
Because we can't have any anti-Semitic

1560
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
Kill all Muslims

1561
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,624
Straub and Paul Joseph Watson

1562
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,696
Create

1563
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,024
Not what anybody is saying that you

1564
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
What did say

1565
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,840
F***** up

1566
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,864
So

1567
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,912
I mean

1568
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:49,312
To take her face because it was

1569
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:53,920
How she said it was

1570
01:29:54,176 --> 01:30:00,320
How do we lose its beak

1571
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
Cuz they don't care

1572
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,416
Because they don't f****** care has

1573
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,464
About money and Society

1574
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
That's a good point

1575
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,608
Yeah

1576
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,888
Because

1577
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
Rarely

1578
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
Has Paul Joseph Watson Institute

1579
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,312
They've been working together for a decade

1580
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
Do your bodies

1581
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,944
He calls all the time is that all I need

1582
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
Get this article up

1583
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,552
Right just write articles

1584
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,112
Alright big headache

1585
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
Depend

1586
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
Relationship

1587
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,488
Yeah

1588
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,560
Studio and they spend like I said a lot of time talking about

1589
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,096
Were victims immediate Center

1590
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
But

1591
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
I think

1592
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
They come

1593
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Wasted

1594
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,264
The rest of the time

1595
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
But they have

1596
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Half an hour

1597
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
On an issue

1598
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
No one cares

1599
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
They're wrong

1600
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,176
About

1601
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Jordan is going to be grossed

1602
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,576
Who's going to run for the Democrats

1603
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,880
Michelle Obama's not going to run because she needs a physic

1604
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
Tustumena washes

1605
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:12,000
Nobody even if you left the old upholstery serious

1606
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:16,096
She has the face of a man chest shoulders

1607
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:19,680
It looks like she's got a a summer sausage enter fan

1608
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:26,080
It's like Obama was raised by a train transsexuals obsessed with it

1609
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:29,920
That Michelle Obama is Michael

1610
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:41,184
She's got but we worked out yesterday

1611
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,096
Lubbock

1612
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:55,264
And somebody

1613
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,360
But I mean the fact that she's got

1614
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
It's not a bad thing

1615
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,968
It's just that what weird psyop

1616
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,760
For the elites are they so obsessed with me

1617
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,832
First

1618
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,440
That's crazy

1619
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,768
Conversation

1620
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
Brothers four

1621
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,144
Maybe 15-20 minutes

1622
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
But Michelle Obama being a man

1623
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,264
It's it's real f*****-up

1624
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,104
Mobile right there

1625
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
You ever thought

1626
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,408
It's not a good thought

1627
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,432
You're very angry

1628
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
I'm just going to sit here and

1629
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,576
Figure out how to put this into words

1630
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,416
Is aphasia

1631
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,976
Very generous

1632
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
Putting what I'm thinking

1633
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:52,096
I would I would go as Primal scream

1634
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:58,496
Wendy Marcus.

1635
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,032
I'm actually very

1636
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
II

1637
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,456
Just been pathetic

1638
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Can't

1639
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
Except

1640
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
Because this

1641
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
Outside of

1642
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Regular

1643
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,792
This is something that's outside

1644
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,328
Not not for everybody

1645
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,632
I mean for this

1646
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:30,752
Subsection of humanity called

1647
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,776
Badfinger

1648
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,568
Yet will I mean this

1649
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,872
F***** up

1650
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
When I hear stuff like this I just

1651
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
You have gotten so into

1652
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,296
Trolli

1653
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,344
Memelord sort of

1654
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
World of

1655
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
Of the internet

1656
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,720
The departs of Reddit

1657
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
But you have lost

1658
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
Control of what

1659
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,584
You're even saying

1660
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,120
Because in the past

1661
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,936
Waffle between like

1662
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,984
Legit accusations

1663
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,776
That they're lying about

1664
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,312
Michelle Obama

1665
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
Being

1666
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,896
Yeah

1667
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,712
We were just joking around when people Preston

1668
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
I'm about it

1669
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,760
I don't like

1670
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,040
That he's now

1671
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Sort of Rhian

1672
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
Invigorating

1673
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
This in 29

1674
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:21,184
But I also recognize that he's probably trying

1675
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
Covering

1676
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,280
Like that's the disorder

1677
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,096
Defensive game that we have to play all the time now

1678
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,680
Because when he talks about these sneak attacks like going on Rogan

1679
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,984
The speaker tags are also him talking

1680
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,592
I'm about stuff like this cuz he's hoping people will cover him to give him more attention

1681
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
He leaves

1682
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,688
Hewitt on his left his own device

1683
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Wilderness

1684
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,016
Who is going to run out of supplies

1685
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Ready

1686
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Quit

1687
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
At this point

1688
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,880
But if he keeps playing games like this

1689
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
Keeps trying to do

1690
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:52,928
Do things

1691
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:57,024
Essentially troll people into keeping his name in the headlines

1692
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,584
You gets a little bit of

1693
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,864
You get some supplies

1694
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
He get some water

1695
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
He get some

1696
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,216
Really f***** up

1697
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,776
People who believe whatever

1698
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Dumb s***

1699
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,848
Cute rolling to Media ways to donate

1700
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,896
Or whatever you're like that

1701
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,664
The game

1702
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,456
That's a possibility

1703
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
Other possibilities

1704
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
He just doesn't give a s***

1705
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,552
7 fun with his buddy

1706
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:20,576
Either way

1707
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,928
So abhorrent

1708
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,464
And so pointless

1709
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
And they think it's

1710
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:33,888
Funny and it's not like I'm just as I am

1711
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,424
There's nothing even

1712
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,776
Orderly rapist

1713
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:44,128
Cuz it's really racist

1714
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,736
Serena is so good because she's actually a myth

1715
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,576
Things were never replied to like Sharapova

1716
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,880
I guess she wasn't that great

1717
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,816
A better figure than tennis player

1718
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
Against strong

1719
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,472
Women of color

1720
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Their stature

1721
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,200
It's so hard to unpack because it is an attack

1722
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,224
But even

1723
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Call

1724
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,272
Attack is on

1725
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,808
Because

1726
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
People

1727
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,392
Don't stake.

1728
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,184
Word cheat

1729
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,976
It would be

1730
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,512
A horrible

1731
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,816
Nothing but in that world it is

1732
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
It's f***** up

1733
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,520
I don't think either of us are triggered

1734
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,592
In the problem

1735
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
You were breaking up

1736
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,688
Disappointing is a massive under

1737
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:55,040
Massive understatement bring up is also a problem

1738
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
Conversation about

1739
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,464
There is a part of it that you're trying

1740
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
Gheefunny

1741
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
There's no joke

1742
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,096
But the other thing is

1743
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Alex

1744
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,656
I'm not joking

1745
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
This is like

1746
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,704
This is true

1747
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:14,240
This is

1748
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,288
Fruit

1749
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,616
If the joke is that he

1750
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
He keeps saying

1751
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,152
He believes

1752
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:22,944
No joke

1753
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
Where's a joke

1754
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:32,672
How many how many different ways are the globalist ways can you describe this

1755
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
First off

1756
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,000
Anyting

1757
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,328
That invalidates literally anything you have to say about anything

1758
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,168
If you ever talk about anything that the President says or does

1759
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:49,568
Criticism that the president

1760
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,616
You have been validated and you are worth

1761
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,712
Is so much

1762
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,248
Similar to

1763
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,064
So many conversations we've had where it's like

1764
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,136
Let's engage with the right and how they think

1765
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
There's nothing to engage with

1766
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,440
You gone

1767
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,512
He is not to be involved

1768
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
.

1769
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:15,424
A lot of thoughts

1770
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,216
I will Octonauts as well

1771
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
Niihau

1772
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,872
Not about this being

1773
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Nefarious

1774
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
Occupied with the ID

1775
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,504
Idea that Michelle Obama

1776
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,600
Play

1777
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,184
Whether I'm right or wrong

1778
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:41,280
I mean Michelle Obama

1779
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Anna

1780
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,424
When she comes out it's like

1781
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Everybody's

1782
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:52,800
Problem

1783
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
Water hose

1784
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,736
He's real interested

1785
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,576
No I understand

1786
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:07,392
I meant gross show

1787
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,768
Weird talk about

1788
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
Corn

1789
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,352
Teaching kids to 5th and school and what have you

1790
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:21,472
And then towards the end of it for like 20 minutes

1791
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:25,824
This big Swingin water hose like it's gross like

1792
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,896
From just a level is like doing a radio

1793
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,688
Show show I would say

1794
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,968
This is gross

1795
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,528
Disgusting

1796
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,576
Any other radio shows like

1797
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:46,304
But there was watching a video of Trump's press conference at

1798
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
Nothing between his legs

1799
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
I think

1800
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,192
He is actually a Ken doll

1801
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,472
I don't think he has a penis

1802
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,264
I think it was removed

1803
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Nazi

1804
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
Father

1805
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:06,016
And I hope everybody knows that my prompt

1806
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,552
Chicago

1807
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,832
Comedian Adam Burke

1808
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
Micropenis

1809
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
And that

1810
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,304
Hit this to me you're such a

1811
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,584
Distillation

1812
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
Of

1813
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
How Alex

1814
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Deals with

1815
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,216
Yes people criticizing

1816
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,264
He thinks that they're f******

1817
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
Accordingly

1818
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:35,200
My problem is the more they mess with me the more I work inside the week

1819
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,184
Did I just expect you to give up

1820
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,816
Going to go anywhere

1821
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:54,144
Nothing's going to happen

1822
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,192
Like like you like you

1823
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,568
Do I dream about

1824
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,128
That's not good that's not good

1825
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,688
Sympathetic

1826
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Like these apps

1827
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
Concrete ideas

1828
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
Reporting

1829
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,576
You f***** up on this

1830
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Do you work

1831
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,392
Putting people in danger

1832
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
You have caused

1833
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
Harassment

1834
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,976
Tons of people

1835
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,280
That sort of

1836
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,584
Big because of your action

1837
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,376
Because of the lack of

1838
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:28,448
Well I mean earlier you said you missed this production meeting

1839
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,520
Just do your editorial s*** on Arabic

1840
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,336
Cause of that sort of sloppy

1841
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
You have caused me

1842
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
Massimo

1843
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,432
In people's lives

1844
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,224
Will look

1845
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
They're f***

1846
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
That's fine

1847
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
F****** with

1848
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
And I went people f*** with

1849
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
I want to strangle

1850
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,952
Wrangling

1851
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
We're done

1852
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
Wednesday

1853
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
It starts

1854
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
And Alex Hayes

1855
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Big announce

1856
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,592
Just a few minutes ago before we went live

1857
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,688
Emergency call from Tommy Robinson

1858
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,248
Leftist

1859
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
Documents

1860
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,424
Desperately trying to set him up and send him back to prison

1861
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,544
Brought down

1862
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,080
Nationwide

1863
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,872
Tens of thousands of children free

1864
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,272
I thought yesterday on the show

1865
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:49,088
You were saying that the Muslims are the only ones

1866
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
You are great

1867
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,440
Does bettas and Tire

1868
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,208
Career

1869
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:54,976
Demonized

1870
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Muslims

1871
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,768
Is a living hero

1872
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
I'm not sure Moses

1873
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,864
Not sure really how to work that like Moses

1874
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,680
Tell you about what this is about

1875
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:10,592
On the evening of March 4th Tommy Robinson showed up at the house of a British journalist by the name of Mike.

1876
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:16,480
I saw this unfolding on Twitter about how scary the experience for him

1877
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
Police reports that

1878
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,088
At least one article in the guardian

1879
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,880
And Tommy Robinson Zone

1880
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
Live stream

1881
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,672
Study put out

1882
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,488
Micah doing some reporting on Tommy Robinson

1883
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,792
Habit of showing up at his critics

1884
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,888
In the clear attempt to intimidate them into silence

1885
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,656
In addition to

1886
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,424
Dachshund

1887
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,448
Without ever

1888
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,008
Because he's

1889
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,056
Live streaming

1890
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:45,408
My kitten's trying to get the ball rolling on a class action lawsuit against Robinson

1891
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,944
Clearance

1892
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,968
Betting definition

1893
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,808
So naturally Tommy showed up at Mike's house around 10:15 p.m.

1894
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,392
Bang on the door and insisting that he want to just talk

1895
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,928
Just wanted to talk

1896
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:01,024
My climate there was banging on multiple doors and windows

1897
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,560
What you took as a sign that it wasn't

1898
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,584
Just Tommy there

1899
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:07,424
As this was happening he began getting tons of messages on social media

1900
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,520
Different account

1901
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Tommy

1902
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
All stuff Mike

1903
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
Is posted screenshot

1904
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:19,968
Mike called the police

1905
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
And told him to leave

1906
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:21,760
What you did

1907
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:25,088
Only to return back on bike store again around 5 a.m.

1908
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,136
My call the police again and filed

1909
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,952
Tommy Robinson is doing damage

1910
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
Neutral

1911
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
Because

1912
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,584
It's an absolutely clear cases what he did was illegal

1913
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,376
And out Mike isn't afraid of

1914
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,448
David please audio and video.

1915
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:45,056
He probably wouldn't have to give the police anything so it's Tommy's livestream had all the evidence

1916
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:45,824
Necessary

1917
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,384
Including Tommy Robinson giving out my

1918
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
Full address

1919
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,968
And threatening to expose him and calling him a paddle

1920
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:56,832
In order to save face as all these monstrous assholes

1921
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,624
Tommy is now playing the victim

1922
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,928
Houston saunas

1923
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,464
He went over to this guy's house

1924
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
Threatening

1925
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,792
Because it was in response to

1926
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,328
To him receiving a

1927
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,656
Informant

1928
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Against him that was

1929
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:15,264
What you think's is exposing its

1930
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,104
He didn't allege that Mike

1931
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,384
Head

1932
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
Things to do with letter being delivered

1933
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,712
I don't know why you think so

1934
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,504
Him showing up at this guy's house

1935
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
Twice in a night

1936
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,832
Is an appropriate self-defense

1937
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
Absurd

1938
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:37,536
Your honor I do not stalk that man I just showed up at his house multiple times in the middle of the night

1939
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:42,144
Without his consent and screamed at him and knocked on his door

1940
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,496
Other than

1941
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,080
And I gave out his address to everyone listening in my life

1942
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:55,456
Forever ever violent stupid

1943
01:45:55,968 --> 01:46:02,112
What this all boils down to is that Robinson's fifteen-year-olds Syrian child

1944
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,696
Edit School in Huntersville

1945
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,000
Because he can't accept any in

1946
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,072
Victims of something

1947
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:15,168
You made videos claiming with a child in those

1948
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,960
Girls at the school previous.

1949
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,240
The videos

1950
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:24,128
Something that he was in all likelihood just making up explicitly said was false

1951
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,176
Mike stockberry was part of a group

1952
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,456
That was raising funds to

1953
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,992
Play pay the legal car

1954
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,272
Just

1955
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,832
Slander Against Child

1956
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,624
And he was

1957
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,392
Fuct

1958
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,440
What do monsters do when they're back

1959
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,976
What corner they attack

1960
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,256
Or in this case

1961
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:43,584
Show up

1962
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
Mike

1963
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,680
Received tons of messages on social media

1964
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
From Robinson

1965
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,008
They're on their way to his house

1966
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,848
People on Circle

1967
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,640
Even in Europe

1968
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,944
European far-right Circle

1969
01:46:59,456 --> 01:46:59,968
And

1970
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
Mike posted

1971
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,040
The video of coming home to find a note

1972
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:03,808
Azdor

1973
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,344
It says we'll be back

1974
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
But of course Alex doesn't give a f***

1975
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:13,280
He doesn't care that Tommy slandered an innocent fifteen-year-old child who was the victim

1976
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Bullying

1977
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,328
It started all of this

1978
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:21,728
He doesn't care that Tommy absolutely harassed Mike's duckberry in a criminal and actionable way

1979
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:22,496
And Michael

1980
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,264
Terrorized

1981
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,032
Because of it

1982
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
No

1983
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
The story that Alec

1984
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,104
How to tell

1985
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,640
It's how everyone

1986
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,992
Poor Tommy Robinson

1987
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,272
Deal with

1988
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
These people who are

1989
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,112
Is surrounding it. I will say

1990
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,904
The only version of is that I

1991
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,184
F****** come close to

1992
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,208
Cuz Alex

1993
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,232
Please a video

1994
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,512
Of

1995
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:48,352
Confronting people outside his house who he says are MI5

1996
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,144
They have recording equipment in the back

1997
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,424
Back of the car whatever

1998
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
It's very

1999
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,240
It's nonsensical

2000
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,776
8 is not evidence of any

2001
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,056
But

2002
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,336
If they are

2003
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,640
They are there because what

2004
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,920
He did to this guy

2005
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,224
Because

2006
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
He

2007
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,040
The other night

2008
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,832
Went over to this guy's house

2009
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
The police came

2010
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,648
Talked him into leaving

2011
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,208
And then 56 hours later

2012
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,488
Showed back up

2013
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
This guy

2014
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,352
When all he done

2015
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,400
Is respond to the fact that Tommy

2016
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,168
Slander.

2017
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,728
Who was the victim of bullying

2018
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
It was like

2019
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,056
Let

2020
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,080
Crowdfund

2021
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,872
The legal defense

2022
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,664
Required for this person

2023
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,456
Just do him

2024
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,480
Be able to

2025
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,296
It's monstrously

2026
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
Pathetic

2027
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
And Alex

2028
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,112
Is

2029
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,904
First aid in Tommy is

2030
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:45,952
It's faster

2031
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,232
8 idiots

2032
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,912
Wide variety of

2033
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
Acceptable punished

2034
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,008
That don't actually

2035
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,544
You fit the reality of the

2036
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
Is that

2037
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,176
Tommy Robbins

2038
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,760
Has done more damage to the world

2039
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,064
Steve yaxley-lennon Orem

2040
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
Whichever

2041
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,928
Has done more damage to the world than anyone murderer

2042
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,256
But if you murder somebody you're going to spend your life in

2043
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:27,168
Probable murder

2044
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:30,496
You are the instigator for so much

2045
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,032
Violence and horror

2046
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
And yet

2047
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
Your you're

2048
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,896
Amethyst

2049
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,920
To the stuff that I wanted

2050
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,200
Bring into the conversation

2051
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:46,368
Grooming gang stuff earlier

2052
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,672
When we talked about how all of this

2053
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
This bike Williams

2054
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,744
Reports reports

2055
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,768
They put out was

2056
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
Deeply flawed and

2057
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,072
Didn't take him to work out

2058
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
That fit their own diagnostic

2059
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,168
Because they were white

2060
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,008
Tommy Robinson to someone who

2061
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,544
His Maiden entire career

2062
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,568
Out of

2063
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,104
About

2064
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,384
Muslim

2065
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
Our leading these

2066
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,432
Rape

2067
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,296
And he's the only person who's willing to stand up against it

2068
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,184
Give Tommy

2069
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:21,952
Hover

2070
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,744
For the Islam

2071
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,512
Phobic

2072
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
Bigoted

2073
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,304
Xenophobic

2074
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,120
Yeah it exists in

2075
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
This whole

2076
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,656
Continue

2077
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,216
So Alex is got this message

2078
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,264
From Tommy that's not good

2079
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Critical

2080
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,712
But you can't khatami on the phone

2081
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,480
Cuz he's the

2082
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
So

2083
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
We get to Alex

2084
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,856
Telugu story

2085
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,464
Arrested for Christian cross

2086
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,560
Across the street

2087
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:06,752
Germany Sweden others have been ordering churches near Old processor

2088
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,200
Wonderful thing

2089
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:19,808
Alex is talking about

2090
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,648
From this story

2091
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,464
Posted on

2092
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,232
Euronews

2093
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,048
35g

2094
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:35,424
Greeks that charges of public property

2095
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,216
Anorexic Construction

2096
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,240
The cycle

2097
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:41,568
On the Cliffs of apia in Viet

2098
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,104
Lesbos is capital

2099
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,152
Is on the grounds of the island

2100
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:48,224
Archaeological law

2101
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,528
They weren't in trouble because it was a cross

2102
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,112
Xenophobic

2103
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,672
Because of where they built it

2104
01:51:57,184 --> 01:52:00,512
The exact article talks about how a simple cross was erected

2105
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,072
But it wasn't on protect

2106
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,120
So no one got arrested

2107
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,424
How to

2108
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,448
Profound way sloppy

2109
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:15,360
41

2110
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:22,272
Because it was on archaeological ground like protected

2111
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:28,672
It was because the ghosts

2112
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,232
The bring that up in the article but

2113
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Thrust of the article is like

2114
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,816
Let's believe that that's

2115
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:37,632
Bulshit

2116
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,168
Wow nonsense

2117
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,728
His article includes

2118
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,496
The fly

2119
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,568
Interesting Lee the same Rocky cliff

2120
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
Is where a quote

2121
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,384
Cultural coexistence

2122
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,920
Tore down another

2123
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,224
Because it was

2124
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,504
Offensive to migrants

2125
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,088
Their source for that story is a hyperlink

2126
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,880
Another Infowars story

2127
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,768
The only source for that second for stories and articles

2128
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,048
Greek City Times

2129
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,840
It doesn't say that a quote

2130
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,632
Cultural coexistence

2131
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,912
Tore down the cross

2132
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,984
That is completely made up by Ben Warren

2133
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,032
The writer of this Infowars already

2134
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,568
That article

2135
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,104
In the

2136
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,872
Greek city time

2137
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,432
As well as the recent one in the Euro News

2138
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:25,504
Only reports that a group called cook coexistence

2139
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,296
Communication in the education

2140
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,856
He complained about the cross and request

2141
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,904
Is there a month

2142
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,952
Later it was destroyed by Vandals

2143
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,488
There's no indication

2144
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,024
Head

2145
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
Add vandals are the same

2146
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
That's okay

2147
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:41,376
Chores

2148
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,912
In their editorial

2149
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:49,312
That's as the level of like this is Barbra Streisand donates $100,000

2150
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:53,408
Is coming out of Senator inhofe mouth and then Ten Years Later being like

2151
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:58,016
I don't need a reference that Barbra Streisand down there today was you though

2152
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:02,112
You're linking to your own f****** artist all the time

2153
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
That's pathetic

2154
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:07,488
What did the original story was written by Paul Joseph Watson

2155
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,840
Concrete cross

2156
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,144
To the Greek City Times

2157
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
Witchduck

2158
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
Say that

2159
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,984
Coexist

2160
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:23,104
Enough through like

2161
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,456
Take to switch won't do

2162
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,272
Person who wrote the

2163
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,552
Infowars

2164
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
Just make the

2165
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,928
Existence group

2166
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,464
Toward

2167
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,792
Explicitly

2168
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,840
And there is nothing in any

2169
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
Resources

2170
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,192
Anyway back that up really

2171
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,336
The premise of

2172
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,872
Varsho but I like these

2173
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Concrete

2174
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,200
That are just like this is bad

2175
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:01,504
Reporting on a

2176
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,064
Indisputable

2177
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:09,952
I'm take all of you

2178
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:13,536
That is literally just job

2179
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:15,840
I don't even care what direction this is torture

2180
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,872
If it was a project reporting something you don't have the right to

2181
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
Episode we talked to

2182
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,272
You accuse me

2183
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,624
Paul Joseph Watson

2184
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,392
I'm showing up

2185
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,416
In Austin

2186
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,696
Absurd

2187
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,464
It's crazy

2188
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,512
Yeah

2189
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,048
To excuse it

2190
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,328
Feisty

2191
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,888
All of the

2192
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,680
People posting that Paul Joe spots

2193
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,216
Studio

2194
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,032
A group on Facebook

2195
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
Studio

2196
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,896
Let's knock it weird about that

2197
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,920
Like he was showing up there too

2198
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:07,040
Now it's time to get weird when I listen to the March 6th

2199
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,368
Next Episode by figure it out I know exactly

2200
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,136
Why he was

2201
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
And

2202
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,768
This is the end of Infowars

2203
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
Pushed you

2204
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:28,544
I guess 89 years ago to start your own Twitter to start your own YouTube to get out on air

2205
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:33,152
And I have encouraged you just because the way the world works

2206
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:37,248
Go out and do more and enacted

2207
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,808
I know we tried to do some TV stuff in England

2208
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:42,112
NFL through trying to herd cats

2209
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:51,328
Your own site your own operation we're very excited about that any successful operation

2210
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,936
You also spawned

2211
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:03,360
Your only hope is they will grow up to be just as strong and successful as you've

2212
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:11,040
He had to make himself at the Abbey

2213
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
He's done

2214
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,928
That

2215
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,816
Individual

2216
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:29,216
Holy s*** well I think it's a smart move on Paul's Parts because Alex is already said

2217
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:34,336
Start your own thing

2218
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,384
You didn't need him for years

2219
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,688
Paul Joseph Watson is he

2220
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
Basically

2221
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,480
To soft launch

2222
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:42,272
His own goodbye

2223
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,344
Amazing

2224
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,024
Was

2225
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
I think

2226
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:56,608
Probably an excuse to come to

2227
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,424
Studio

2228
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,704
And then also

2229
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,472
Probably

2230
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,264
Tie up some loose ends

2231
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,800
Yeah

2232
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,360
Are you says on this episode

2233
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,152
Like it's in need

2234
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:15,552
I'm done with it down with Infowars

2235
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:19,648
He's doing the whole thing he's saying goodbye but is God

2236
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:27,584
Latest

2237
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,120
For this guy

2238
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,144
Ziploc

2239
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,424
Are you recognized

2240
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,240
See the writing on the wall

2241
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
Huh

2242
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
It's bad

2243
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
His

2244
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:39,616
Friend

2245
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,408
Oldies old

2246
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
People

2247
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,968
There's no real engagement

2248
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,808
People who are younger do like me

2249
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,184
It's because of History

2250
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:57,280
And he's do that service

2251
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,304
To do this

2252
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:03,424
Hurrah together one last time

2253
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,216
That kind of goodbye

2254
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,520
And he's going back to f****** London

2255
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,824
And he is going to stay there

2256
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:15,968
Empire

2257
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,248
Let's see who we get

2258
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:23,392
Available

2259
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:33,632
Is a lot of people within 40 probably also look at the trucks yet

2260
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:37,216
Completely poach the entire operation so f******

2261
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,264
Looting funder

2262
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:45,408
Yeah the people who pay Alex's didn't have an ego too big

2263
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,968
I think that this is like

2264
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,992
I know that

2265
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,016
Hey I may be

2266
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
Speak to

2267
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,320
Sometimes

2268
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,344
This is

2269
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Alex

2270
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,672
John this really is it

2271
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,208
This is like

2272
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,000
Illusion Paul Joseph Watson

2273
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:00,768
Is

2274
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,048
Stoke

2275
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
Crucially

2276
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,864
Devastating

2277
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
F****** moment

2278
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,472
I don't see how he exists

2279
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,008
Because

2280
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:13,568
Paul Joseph Watson was really the only thing that

2281
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:17,152
A demographic that wasn't

2282
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,944
Adagio

2283
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,760
People who are still mad about OKC

2284
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,040
I don't know

2285
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,976
Brain survive

2286
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,512
Leaving the one

2287
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,816
Without the one person

2288
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,096
Who kind of connect

2289
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,632
Under 50

2290
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,424
Yeah I really don't understand

2291
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:41,216
I might be wrong my projects

2292
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,592
But it's

2293
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:49,920
I don't know who she is so the answer is probably not

2294
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:50,944
Kent State

2295
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:52,480
Who now works

2296
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,272
F*** off

2297
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,064
Butterfly kits

2298
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,112
Can I hear this

2299
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,256
That the fact

2300
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,328
The first date

2301
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,960
Why did you waste that time

2302
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,984
With your guy

2303
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:17,568
Knowing that the next day on are you were going to announce

2304
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,360
He's going solo

2305
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,384
He is done

2306
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,432
And they keep you in the spring weather like

2307
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,224
We'll still collaborate

2308
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:30,112
I don't I don't I don't like the idea of

2309
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Them

2310
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,672
Claiming that Michelle has

2311
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,208
Has a dick being there

2312
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:38,304
Like the end of Ocean's 11 moment where they're all standing around

2313
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,328
The f****** fountain

2314
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,984
No not thinking that they're going to get back together now we're going to part ways

2315
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,288
I don't like that

2316
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,568
What Alex need

2317
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,408
To do to try and not deal with the reality that Paul

2318
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
And that he had

2319
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,968
Pushed Paul out

2320
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,016
He said

2321
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,552
Repeatedly on here

2322
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:03,392
We can't afford to pay the salary I might have to lay him off

2323
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,208
If you're Paul Joseph Watson what are you going to do

2324
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,328
Fight for yourself create your own sake

2325
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,608
Haven't eaten for years

2326
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,656
So do your own f****** thing

2327
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:15,936
Is that real

2328
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
Royale

2329
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:18,752
It's going to be a disaster

2330
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
I don't know what is

2331
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,080
Man

2332
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
Heavy

2333
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,200
Fitness

2334
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:33,856
Rock the foundations of War I don't know

2335
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:38,720
You thought I was talking s*** when I started this episode

2336
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:42,048
Redwood Rock the foundation of the many times before

2337
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,888
This time I was

2338
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:47,168
This is

2339
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,704
This is huge

2340
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,496
Holyshit

2341
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
Cuz nobody

2342
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,544
He has on staff

2343
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:56,384
Is even close to his popular or as good

2344
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,432
A propaganda is Paul

2345
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Like

2346
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,504
These people

2347
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,272
Schlub

2348
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,040
He's got

2349
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,392
Imagine how pissed off he is

2350
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:13,280
Is this the color of money are we watching Paul Newman and Tom Cruise break up

2351
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:17,888
Is that what's happening right now in the near future

2352
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,192
No I don't think so I think all is going

2353
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:22,496
To become the new

2354
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,288
This eccentric

2355
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,336
Propaganda Outlet

2356
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,128
Probably

2357
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:30,176
I think he's going to say is out

2358
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,576
Say what you want but

2359
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:40,672
The Hardline right-wing lunatics that Alex

2360
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,512
Quartz rose quartz

2361
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,048
Steven Universe

2362
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,864
Follow-up British pop

2363
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,168
Is there's not going to

2364
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,192
I don't think they will

2365
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,008
I don't know this is going to be

2366
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:55,776
So fast

2367
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:58,080
A sorcerer

2368
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:58,848
Who wouldn't

2369
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:00,640
Still fuk around with

2370
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,920
No course

2371
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:05,760
In America is going to listen to

2372
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:13,184
I really don't believe that

2373
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,024
I know it is

2374
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,608
I understand

2375
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,680
His presentation

2376
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,496
And exit weird

2377
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,520
Frenetic

2378
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,568
Constant Cuts in the

2379
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,592
Yes

2380
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:34,176
Music

2381
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,224
Did eviction

2382
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:37,760
Create something

2383
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,528
Successful

2384
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
I think is foolish

2385
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,600
I just don't

2386
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,392
See how this is the

2387
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:48,512
I don't see how Alex doesn't turn this into a into a professional wrestling

2388
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,304
I don't think

2389
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,352
Can I think

2390
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,400
He has created his own

2391
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,424
Better

2392
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:56,960
To some extent

2393
02:04:57,216 --> 02:05:00,800
This feels like the beginning of

2394
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,568
The end

2395
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,616
Like

2396
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,152
Completely

2397
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:07,200
Perspective

2398
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:08,736
Losing Paul Joseph Watson

2399
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,624
And this really to me

2400
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,904
Sounds like someone

2401
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,536
All the persecution

2402
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,656
I get to know listeners

2403
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,728
Can I get to know people like Tommy

2404
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,496
Robinson

2405
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,296
Turn off the best Father's the best activist

2406
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:49,440
I need to know the people that don't back down to censorship

2407
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,976
I get to know the

2408
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:54,560
Troyer's and I get to know you

2409
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:58,144
About

2410
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,192
Some stupid Hollywood Manor

2411
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,984
Brad Pitt set

2412
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,992
Zumiez

2413
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,416
Yeah

2414
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
Hey look

2415
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:23,488
Look everything is been really tough in

2416
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,608
People are really mad at me but it's all been worth it because I've got to

2417
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,376
Meet you

2418
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:32,704
Alex doesn't think

2419
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:37,056
He runs away from them that's crazy

2420
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,616
I know the best journalist

2421
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,896
Laura Loomer

2422
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,432
Like that

2423
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:44,480
It's old so insincere

2424
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,760
What's behind it

2425
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
The feeling of it

2426
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Is

2427
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,832
I'm done

2428
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,880
And maybe it's because

2429
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
I think

2430
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,184
Here if I had to guess

2431
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:59,584
That's not even like I am going to fight for Jeopardy even through stage 4 pancreatic cancer

2432
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:03,168
That setback

2433
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,728
The ability to make that joke

2434
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,776
Is so cool

2435
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,568
Yeah

2436
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:11,104
Yeah

2437
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,384
He came in like a

2438
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,920
If you haven't seen the video go watch

2439
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,968
But Alex Trebek

2440
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,784
I don't want anybody else

2441
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,344
I believe in

2442
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,112
The connection that we

2443
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,904
I don't want to hide

2444
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:25,440
I am dealing

2445
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,560
I'm going to fight

2446
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:34,144
And then he makes the joke

2447
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:34,912
I have to

2448
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,776
Cuz I have three years left so good

2449
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:41,824
Amazing so good

2450
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
Yep

2451
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,688
Everything you wanted Trebek to ever be like

2452
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,040
You said you thought you knew I thought you knew him from the game show

2453
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,344
But you know there's always that distance

2454
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,160
This personal video you're like

2455
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:02,048
You are you are what I've always believed you

2456
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,328
Jesus

2457
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,864
The humor of it is just

2458
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,632
So

2459
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:07,168
Yeah this is the

2460
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:16,896
Cuz Alex isn't dealing with anything other than his own consequence

2461
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:21,504
USA in America we don't deserve Trebek's

2462
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:23,808
We deserve Alex Jones

2463
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,600
Deserve

2464
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,672
Fracture back

2465
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,256
With life of qualm

2466
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,072
Have an accent

2467
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,120
Because

2468
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,400
Outlets

2469
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,424
Good for

2470
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,056
The reality is like

2471
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:49,664
Crucial mistake

2472
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,688
I mean obviously

2473
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,248
4 years ago talking to

2474
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,272
Rodger Stone

2475
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,296
There's a big mistake

2476
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:01,696
I think every human being has ever talked to Rodger Stone later on found out it's just a mistake

2477
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,768
Enabled

2478
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,560
In ways that Alcon

2479
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,376
Rodger way to

2480
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,400
Control over

2481
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,680
Editorial process

2482
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,216
Operation

2483
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:15,264
But I think Alex f*****-up

2484
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,312
He included Paul

2485
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:19,616
In the people I could lose

2486
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,736
It was talking about like we're losing money

2487
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,272
You guys to donate

2488
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,576
I'm going to lay off Rodger and Paul

2489
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:30,112
Like that sort of thing

2490
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
Is the only excuse

2491
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
Maldive

2492
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:35,232
He's been waiting for free

2493
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,000
Years

2494
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,536
To be like I don't need

2495
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,328
Your dumbass

2496
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,608
To be attached to me

2497
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,400
I'm not banned from

2498
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,216
Twitter I'm not from social media

2499
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,240
Ivan

2500
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:51,872
Like I'm just wild you've given me an excuse to start my own operation

2501
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,664
Right

2502
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,688
And that

2503
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:57,248
Paul Joseph Watson

2504
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,784
Hertz Alex

2505
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,808
In a way that

2506
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,576
No-bake

2507
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,856
No censorship

2508
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:02,624
Africa

2509
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:04,928
Because it takes away the only

2510
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,720
Competent player in his Opera

2511
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,512
There are other people who

2512
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,280
Do like

2513
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:10,816
I don't know

2514
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,888
I don't know why he reporting

2515
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,960
Do like two star match

2516
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:17,984
Or whatever

2517
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,032
You know whatever

2518
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:21,568
Millie Weaver

2519
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,104
Distract people

2520
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:27,712
Paul Joseph Watson was the only guy who

2521
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
Who's coming

2522
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,248
It's like

2523
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,528
I understand

2524
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,064
Craft I understand

2525
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:37,440
Buganda there I'm helping you you and I work in a symbiotic

2526
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,024
F***

2527
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:44,864
I think would you hear stuff like that would you talkin about like

2528
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:48,448
It's so great I mean how much I love

2529
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,776
Like that's what I hear when

2530
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:59,200
Allah Allah

2531
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,224
Worth it because

2532
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,528
That one show was really great

2533
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:05,600
Because I did this I got to be

2534
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:12,000
I have to

2535
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:18,400
Of course I'm not saying he's not it is

2536
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,448
Successful

2537
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:26,592
The festival circuit

2538
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,640
Everyone has a story of meeting it

2539
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,712
What's the story you get

2540
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,480
Like

2541
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,040
It's been years

2542
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,112
But it was worth

2543
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
Wire Z

2544
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,440
I believe he wants to quit I agree

2545
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:45,024
I agree with you on like 99% of what you're saying

2546
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:47,840
All I'm saying is that there will be

2547
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,120
1

2548
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,656
Last Ride

2549
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:54,240
And that is going to be the fight against his protege

2550
02:11:54,752 --> 02:12:00,128
This is f****** smarter than that

2551
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:04,224
This is the whole situation he's going to get taken down

2552
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:06,784
He is

2553
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,112
G-Eazy

2554
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:10,880
Craft

2555
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:18,048
I also think that he is incapable of avoiding his

2556
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:18,816
Bass

2557
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:22,656
In which are too attached attacks

2558
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,960
That is a

2559
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:28,800
So even now while we're talking about him allowing

2560
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,360
Go

2561
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,920
In three months he doesn't

2562
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:35,712
He doesn't have a f****** memory

2563
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:40,320
He doesn't have the capability

2564
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,648
He went from

2565
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,488
Massacre

2566
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,304
Talking to him

2567
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:55,680
The difference is that Alex knows what's up

2568
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,984
He knows what's up

2569
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:00,032
Like in Inverness

2570
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,312
Circumstance

2571
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,848
It was Quicken

2572
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,128
It moves faster

2573
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,408
F***** up

2574
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:08,480
Alex knows exactly what's going on

2575
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,296
And it's something he's probably been trying to

2576
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,600
Avert for a very long time

2577
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,880
We just Paul wants to

2578
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,672
He now can't

2579
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:17,952
Troll that Paul

2580
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:20,768
Kent

2581
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,352
I understand where you're

2582
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,912
Coming from opposition

2583
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:28,704
Signed is the day's walk

2584
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,032
Psychic

2585
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,312
He's always

2586
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,592
Preservation

2587
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,128
MyON

2588
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,152
Composition

2589
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
But

2590
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:39,456
If Paul

2591
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,224
In his

2592
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,248
Media operation

2593
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,272
He starts

2594
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,832
Still putting the same

2595
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,112
Toxic s***

2596
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,672
That Paul has been forever while he were

2597
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,232
Is Moritz

2598
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,512
Like

2599
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:53,536
She probably will.

2600
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:56,864
Of course

2601
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:58,400
I think that Alex will

2602
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,168
Recognize

2603
02:13:59,424 --> 02:13:59,936
Guys that is

2604
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:01,472
That's an extension of

2605
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,264
Isn't that awesome

2606
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
That it's doing

2607
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,568
Well

2608
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,592
He gets mad

2609
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,872
People like Joe

2610
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,664
Because Jose just a friend of

2611
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,968
The Joe Rogan Experience

2612
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:14,016
Isn't offshoot of

2613
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,040
Podcast

2614
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,600
But whatever Paul does

2615
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,880
Alex will be able to

2616
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:19,904
Claim ownership of

2617
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,696
If only in his own mind

2618
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:23,232
So I don't think

2619
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,256
He wants to fight that

2620
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,792
As long as it's

2621
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:27,840
Enough

2622
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:29,888
And Alex

2623
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:32,704
I think

2624
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,472
I would do

2625
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,264
But I think the hill

2626
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,032
Be able to

2627
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:37,056
Maybe settle

2628
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,080
These lawsuits

2629
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,104
And whatever it.

2630
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:39,872
Efinancial

2631
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,944
Still walking

2632
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:43,712
A couple

2633
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:45,504
Dozens a million

2634
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,576
Liquidate whatever

2635
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,600
Dumb s***

2636
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:52,416
Live

2637
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,720
Wife and Kids

2638
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:55,488
Right

2639
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,024
And then Paul Joseph

2640
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,560
Safire

2641
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:06,240
I agree with where you're coming from

2642
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:14,688
I guess I just disagree in that I think Alex is a pathological lunatic

2643
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,992
To the point where I think if

2644
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:17,760
Rick

2645
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:19,808
Started an Infowars

2646
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:25,440
Dot-com more honor roll Alex would try and destroy him

2647
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:29,024
Like there's a certain amount of that out of like

2648
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:32,608
I want you to succeed but I don't want you to succeed as much as

2649
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:33,376
Cuz I do

2650
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,912
I mean there'll always probably be

2651
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:35,936
Petty jealousy

2652
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
There's no doubt about

2653
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:41,824
We recognize

2654
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,848
Is he's not good at

2655
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:43,872
What he does

2656
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:47,456
Also it's like he's not according to himself

2657
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,480
She's dying

2658
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:51,040
You know whatever is physical

2659
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:51,808
Stop is

2660
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,832
Like he's struggling

2661
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,856
He's not as

2662
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
Good at his job

2663
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:58,208
And Paul Joseph Watson is a good

2664
02:15:59,232 --> 02:15:59,744
20 years

2665
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:05,120
Like that guy carries a mantle of the

2666
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,680
Call Joseph Watson is like 21

2667
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:12,032
Paul Joseph Watson is like five years younger than

2668
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,336
He's probably

2669
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:21,504
How old is Alex Alex

2670
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,040
One he's probably

2671
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:23,808
30 ft

2672
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,856
About 30

2673
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:28,160
Paul Joseph Watson is younger than me

2674
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,696
Yeah from hell no

2675
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:30,976
No chance

2676
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:35,328
Early 30s

2677
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:43,776
S55

2678
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:47,360
He has

2679
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:52,992
Express

2680
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,528
He is a spring chicken

2681
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,296
Compared to Alec

2682
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:56,832
And so

2683
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,368
I just

2684
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,416
If you are someone

2685
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,696
One who works from

2686
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,024
Even if you're a

2687
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,048
Brazen propagate

2688
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,096
There's two

2689
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,888
1 is

2690
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,424
How do I make

2691
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,704
Maximize my profit

2692
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:14,752
I think Alex Mack

2693
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,544
Maximizes things by getting out

2694
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,824
I'm still getting a

2695
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,360
The cut in somewhat

2696
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:21,664
Like trying to bully

2697
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,968
Advertisers who make go to

2698
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:26,016
Paul through

2699
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:27,552
Getting a cut

2700
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:29,088
Whatever

2701
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
Forgot

2702
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:39,328
Or even if Paul Joseph

2703
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,352
Communication Network

2704
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,632
And Alex will be

2705
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,424
To get a finder's fee for that

2706
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,752
Event if

2707
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,312
Ideological

2708
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:50,848
Then Alex

2709
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:54,176
Give up

2710
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,712
Let Paul take

2711
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,760
You have already

2712
02:17:59,296 --> 02:17:59,808
Mentor

2713
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,088
As best you can

2714
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,880
He will fly with

2715
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,208
Yeah

2716
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:08,768
There is no downside to

2717
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:09,536
To quitting

2718
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,328
And letting Paul

2719
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,656
Do it right

2720
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,704
Ego

2721
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,616
I agree with every reason that you have saved

2722
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:26,432
I agree with everything that you have said

2723
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,968
I would I would even

2724
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,272
I would even say if we were to talk

2725
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,040
To Alex

2726
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:31,808
Victor's

2727
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,600
Both of our advice to him

2728
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,160
I don't think

2729
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:36,928
He is

2730
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,464
Capable of

2731
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:39,744
Uptake

2732
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,048
Makes me think

2733
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,120
You think so

2734
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:46,912
So anyway

2735
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,704
Then we'll see what happens

2736
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,728
I'm not sure

2737
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,496
I'm not sure

2738
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:51,520
But we'll see

2739
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,360
Until we fight

2740
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,944
Do we have a redo

2741
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:07,904
It's a place where you couldn't find Alex Jones like social media sites like Twitter

2742
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,256
Facebook

2743
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:15,072
What do we have a group

2744
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:16,864
We got

2745
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:21,472
We are on

2746
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:25,056
I think that

2747
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:25,824
2

2748
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,872
Where we need to be at

2749
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:30,688
Just say

2750
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:35,040
Benicio del Toro also probably hasn't killed me by

2751
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:39,648
We can't prove it but Alex

2752
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:40,928
He probably has

2753
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:44,000
Holding

2754
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:49,632
Alexandra Thurston color
