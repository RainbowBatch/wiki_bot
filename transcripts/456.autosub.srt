1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody sit around a little bit about Alex

Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
Go first cuz I got a little bit of my brush.

8
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Tennis for the first time

9
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
Because the park next to us where we played tennis was completely

10
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Torn down

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
We thought that the tennis courts were gone too but it turns out there was an opening and we could have gone for the past like four months

12
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
So it's real disappointing

13
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
Play tennis is good to get out of work maybe the time away from it justify

14
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Good it feels

15
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
To go back

16
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
Justifies the time away

17
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
Okay

18
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832

23
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
Years ago I find a commercial stupid

24
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
Anti-nausea or whatever

25
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,880

Crazy right-wing family

35
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672

Startling

44
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Under other circumstances

45
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648

If I understand this no correctly

59
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
There is another one

60
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
Ultimate Showdown as was always meant

61
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
I can't wait for that other night

62
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
From now on I feel like I could take that away from you

63
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,535

Don't know anything about it

66
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
I will say that this weekend has been because

67
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
I have been

68
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Like a lot of work

69
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Around the house

70
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Air condition

71
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863

Gray truck gray

73
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
So I got a lot of that stuff going on my life is feeling pretty good

74
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
I feel very close

75
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
To sort of adulting

76
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Friday night Rosa wraps

77
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,527
I'm getting ready to go to bed in my bed for the first time in 15 years

78
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Credible

79
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
No news could pick you off that PETA

80
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,231
Rodger Stone sentence commuted

81
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Not unexpected

82
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
Levi said he would never spend

83
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
Yeah

84
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
Kind of like in my heart of hearts

85
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Deep down

86
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,847
He was probably going to go to prison for Trump to do it

87
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Commuted sentence or pardon Mr

88
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
Give him clemency it so I thought there was a chance

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
But I itch

90
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
You should really second-guess those sorts of things

91
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,743
How to make a bed

92
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,887
Made him beg for so long makes me laugh

93
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
Very hard

94
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,151

Urgency episode Rodger got pardoned

96
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
My sense of it was I need to

Cuz I think Alex is going to snow Saturday probably can do an emergent

98
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391

99
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Settle down on this

100
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah yeah but sometimes it's fun to throw out an emergency

101
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
I'm so excited to wait for Monday

102
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447

Okay alright

167
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Casual recreational softball tryouts

Toss it over to charity new area that sell help

169
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
I don't have a whole lot to announce about the year of the

170
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
Is that I did get a message

171
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
From Bailey

172
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,295
Listen to Bailey that I may have

173
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Ranked

174
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
A single Seltzer twice

175
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
Might have

176
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Giving them to different how far apart

177
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Super far apart

178
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
Not too far apart

179
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Less than 50

180
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,639
Open

181
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
I've decided I talk to the commissioner

182
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,831
And we decided that the 1st

183
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Frankenstein

184
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
Edwards now

00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Vacate that's it

186
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
The second scoring

187
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,679
Humiliating and I don't want this to get out publicly although I'm saying it on a podcast

188
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Jordan

189
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,455
Too much business really recover I don't even think we can eat now there's just too much to cover

190
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Get to it in this

191
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Probably not

192
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
So are we starting the nice and just focusing entirely on like the 11th

193
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,119
Is because I think there's a little bit of a narrative Arc to it

194
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Uno's

195
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
Probably coming for Rodger

196
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Coming up

197
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Bablo next hour

198
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
And he's got big nose

199
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
It's so big

200
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
But I just think I'm going to let him

201
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
And I'm not even going to get ready

202
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Trailer Journey

203
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,767
Schedule

204
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Present present

205
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
You didn't want to work to make this exclusive first place and comes on

206
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,239
Pikachu

207
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
You will

208
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
In 20 minutes

209
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
We won't get these clothes

210
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
So I told him

211
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Make a phone call

212
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
WeChat

213
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Go ahead and go on Fox news or whatever

214
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,255
So this to me sounds like pre-emptive rationalization

215
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,607
He's not going to go on our Joker

216
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,727
Probably at the point where Tucker will have him on and he knows has better ratings there

217
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,615
Now that's just because I'm going to be drunk at 6 he's so drunk at 6 that he just can't come in

218
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
His fault

219
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,015
Rogers and do everything give me the exclusive

220
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,855
Whatever

221
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
I'm going to put in the time to make

222
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
A phone call to

223
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,047
That's why I report about Rogers s*** is on Saturday

224
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
Because they need for the exclusive Friday night

225
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
Malachi little impromptu press conference

226
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Yeah Saturday

227
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,943
Buddy

228
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
Alex does cover the Wayfair

229
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
Conspiracy what happened

230
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Price of course

231
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Yeah so get ready for that

232
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
I hate everyone

233
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
I hate every once in awhile actually

234
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Prairie

235
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Bizarre

236
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Change the name

237
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
On the nights you just start

238
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
You know talking about whatever you know just is normal

239
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Time talking about

240
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
I just came out

241
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
When the FDA

242
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Crastination hundred-thousand-dollar

243
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Baby Parts with steel

244
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Beating

245
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Heart

246
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Berkeley

247
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Said we want

248
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Beating heart

249
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
And so

250
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Would deliver them

251
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Alibaba

252
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
And they would butcher I'm not there on the spot

253
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
If I can pick up

254
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Hot wings

255
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:33,631
Now where is PETA

256
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
University ordered

257
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Beating hearts of babies

258
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
What where is

259
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
I don't know

260
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,663
So there's a unsurprisingly the story that Alex is lying about

261
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,247
Ignored it but it kind of bothered me look it up

262
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
Whatever you said something like that's really hard for me to resist take them up

263
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Straight up

264
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,719
This is from that batch of edited videos that released in 2015 by the Center for Medical

265
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,095
Which was that anti-abortion outlet engaged in Project Veritas style undercover video propaganda

266
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
They're not really a center

267
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
For medical progress

268
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Medical regress

269
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
When it comes down

270
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,407
Exclaim that's made in that Center for Medical progress videos which is exaggerated and distorted

271
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
The video claims that a procedure that

272
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
University researchers

273
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Call Dave profusion

274
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
Requires a beating heart

275
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,839
Having established this erroneous piece of information the video makers then try to demonstrate that heart tissue had been provided

276
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Did the Stanford

277
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,495
To do which is then used to present as evidence that beating human hearts have been delivered

278
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Do Stanford

279
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,383
I'm fine with it this is really sloppy work

280
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
To follow up

281
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
For all the pieces to stand up to scrutiny

282
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
If 1 pieces bad this whole argument collapse

283
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
Perfusion

284
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Kind of destroys the entire point

285
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Everything else could be

286
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
True name leave at Stanford researchers do this

287
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
A procedure and

288
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Obtain heart tissue for it

289
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
And the claim

290
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
The main claim that the beating heart

291
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
You have all that other stuff be true

292
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
And the part that you want to be the point

293
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
The big spiders

294
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
And as it turns out

295
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Bi like a Dorper fusions that are done involving

296
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Stem cell research

297
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
Require of eating hearts

298
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Nothing

299
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
Adventure remember here though is that Alex is even

300
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Fake thing that he's reporting on

301
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,351
The stuff about babies arriving at the University and boxes and then butchering

302
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
That's just a story he wants

303
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
Tell is audience to scare them and make them hate his imagined enemies even more

304
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
So

305
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,383
Turn of a hat on a hat disgusting at the abortion propaganda here

306
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Teaches you how to properly butcher

307
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,039
You know like it's an apprenticeship thing or do you get that right out of med school

308
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,159
I don't know it's also not at all like ordering Wings you don't butcher the wings

309
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
So

310
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Thinking straight

311
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
Sure little bit more about that

312
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Ordered

313
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Fresh

314
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Baby part that just came out last week

315
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Hairstyles

316
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
They want to murder you and your family

317
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
That's another thing you said you can look up so excited

318
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Go ahead and look at up

319
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
Judicial Watch

320
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
So already already

321
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
They are uncovered that the FDA had a contract worth $96,000 between time of 2012

322
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,631
In 2018 with a company called Advanced biosciences resources

323
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
Where they would be provided with fetal tissue for

324
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Everything I can tell

325
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
This is just about themselves and there's nothing wrong

326
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,103
Nothing other than something

327
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Anger there

328
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
And divorce

329
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
Hold on you saying

330
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
That the FDA spend

331
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,039
Such a ridiculous sum of money

332
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
$96,000

333
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
$96,000 of taxpayer money

334
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
That's what

335
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
Small amount for whatever the conspiracy they're trying to stay

336
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Rise to the level of what

337
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
About your bosses

338
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
Cast what if this isn't illegal human

339
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
Organ trafficking operation

340
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,967
Proceed to $95,000 but

341
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
I don't think most people would get mixed up with that for that kind of a big whatever they're taking off the top

342
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,463
Can infect somebody with covid and as we no get $95,000

343
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
Can you read contracts in 2018

344
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
There's no indication that I can find that I know was doing anything illegal or unethical

345
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
I mean I just

346
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Like this just seems like

347
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Blabbering

348
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
So also in the business of

349
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Grilled annihilus

350
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
About resurgent coronavirus cases

351
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
This is

352
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
Some of the headlines

353
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Setting single-day record

354
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
For one day

355
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Edgewater

356
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Good weed

357
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
The number of positive Skyrocket

358
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Those positives are fraudulent

359
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Believe the headline that I just read

360
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Before we started recording

361
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,847
Yesterday Florida had 15,000 positive test

362
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,735
Mostly stuck around

363
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
This July 9th

364
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
For the sake of

365
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Rodger Rodger

366
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,439
We're going to be doing

367
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
Surprise to go to Rodger some Skype

368
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Rob Lawrence

369
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
You got to do is let yourself go

370
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
Having professional Skype issues

371
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
I went to Shakira told me a lot

372
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
What's going on

373
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Imprisonment

374
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Memes

375
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
All those other times

376
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
Constantly

377
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
He's

378
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,120
Just experiencing ask a problem I believe the years from 2009 to 2015

379
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
Every single in and out of break

380
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Sky problem

381
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,568
Kicked off of social media

382
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,384
Nice spin on that

383
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
Analysis

384
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Presidented

385
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Censorship

386
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
Boston Ro is under the same a text saying that his fan

387
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Allowed

388
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
To talk about him or posted speeches or material

389
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
On Facebook

390
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
On

391
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Show ahead of his

392
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Prison

393
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
The president doesn't act

394
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
Another giant exercise

395
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
This is not a case of Facebook just kicking off fans of Rodger bolsonaro

396
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184
Found that employees of bolsonaro government

397
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,256
And Rodger Stone networks of accounts

398
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
To push coordinated misinformation

399
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
It sounds like those two Networks

400
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Are connected

401
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,800
Bolsonaro and his government has a network that was being used

402
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
You push false information

403
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,176
Did Rodger Stone have their own unique Secret

404
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Network

405
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,784
Unclear if it was botanist early or like

406
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
Not just someone running a bunch of dumb

407
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Combination

408
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
According to BBC reporting on the matter

409
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
Facebook 754 accounts

410
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
50 pages and for Instagram accounts that it had link

411
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Drive to mr. Stone

412
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:06,240
These Pages would pose as a person not connected to Rodger and then promote things that he wanted to promote give you.

413
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Organic get engaged

414
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Again from the BBC

415
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
In total those Bhai

416
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Behind the pages spent about

417
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
308

418
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
$8,000 on Facebook advertising

419
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
Three times with the FDA

420
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
There is that

421
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
From this Beast bolsonaro is running with more focus on political maneuvering

422
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
Mostly geerdes self-promotion

423
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
Rodger claims that he's going to sue

424
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,032
So if I had to guess he's going to yell about his innocence

425
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
Use the attention to try and raise money

426
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:48,224
And then I'll admit that he was running all those pages in about five years and some sort of an interview with Playboy or something

427
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Right

428
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,136
So this is the game I'm getting kicked off social media because

429
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,256
Why won't anybody let a white man speak on this very loud radio show

430
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
It is is is

431
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Main point

432
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Is deemed to be

433
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
I would have died

434
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,240
If I go to prison because of covid-19

435
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
And is a hoax

436
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
But

437
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Is going to kill Rodger if he goes to prison

438
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
Seems hard to balance those ideas but they keep trying

439
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
You guilty f*****

440
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
Possible death you believe they're all coming

441
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Situation

442
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,464
I also knows what they'll pull on your brother

443
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Be worried about

444
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Beat you to death

445
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
That would have been the angle the whole time

446
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
Course the beating you to death or something

447
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
Hulk Hogan thing is not going to work with

448
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
The narrative

449
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,480
Triangular prism

450
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,904
Yeah okay way to try to make this work shirt

451
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
Rodger

452
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
What kind of angle B Rodger needs

453
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Because

454
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,400
The kind of things people who don't like him would still kind of have to begrudgingly be like

455
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,520
Write a non-violent criminal you're not really a threat to anybody you probably should be

456
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
If there is a real danger to your help that's a really difficult argument

457
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
If even if you don't like him

458
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
That's why he was in

459
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Employment

460
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Stupid

461
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Alex did join in with

462
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
I would argue though that he

463
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
He had to employ

464
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Cuz he was cuz you don't do any

465
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Stone was also though talking to

466
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
To the judge

467
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
So the judge

468
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
Can listen to the covid argument

469
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
Listen to Rodger saying like

470
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
Hey they might

471
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Kill me because I

472
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah no no

473
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,824
Roger's actions attires

474
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,896
And Alex

475
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
The same time I just

476
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
First to make notes

477
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,368
You know the BBC was reporting the Rodger had these accounts and Facebook said they did

478
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,976
You should notice that I did not say

479
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
Rodger allegedly

480
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
Because I don't want to get sued

481
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
If you're a journalist

482
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
Stay with the Wall Street Journal

483
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
Perfect example

484
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
And you

485
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
As a fact

486
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
Allegedly or may have

487
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
I'm coming after you too

488
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Rodger you are absolutely right

489
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
Call Rodger Stone

490
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,928
They're coming after everybody

491
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
We're going to punish all these be

492
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
We're going to go after millions of people

493
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
Authoritarian

494
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
Real McCoys easily

495
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Rodger you still there

496
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Well-intended

497
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
America's vodka sauce okay

498
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Is internet

499
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
He was on the phone

500
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Get the phone to work

501
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,520
Rodger threatening to sue people

502
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,432
It was a pretty sure that interview and cutting out

503
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
Yeah you allegedly had

504
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Suboxone

505
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Because I don't want

506
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
Yeah I like that you know it's kind of like the old Rodger

507
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,792
Threatening people

508
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
Call the business till Thursday

509
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
So you still you shouldn't

510
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah you coming to get the sense there like he has a

511
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
He's got the info

512
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
Is it going on in 4th and Breton

513
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,664
Need to sue people who report

514
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
His box

515
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
The tone of his previous interviews that we've covered

516
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
I have been very much

517
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Please God please give me

518
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,464
Really over playing the religiousness and my new family

519
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
As soon as I decided to love God and everything turned around

520
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
Some of that he does not say is not discussed

521
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
Praying to Trump

522
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
This time

523
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Now

524
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
If we know one thing

525
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
From our time doing

526
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
In the show

527
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Alex is

528
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
Totally fine

529
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
One tech.

530
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
He is

531
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
He's not mad at the truth

532
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
He's not my

533
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,856
He's the kind of guy who's like

534
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
He's the guy you want

535
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
Trouble cuz he keeps his head about it

536
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Music behind the wheel when you get some ice

537
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,824
Keep calm and knows that knows how to schedule a crisis-management

538
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,904
Yep the most amateur thing on talk radio

539
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Call radio station

540
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Say a little something and then not be there

541
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Roger's cell phone

542
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Ongoing technical difficulties are

543
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Fun

544
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,928
They are fine and I refuse to wallow in the

545
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Julian

546
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Over

547
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592
Feel here that the criminals everywhere

548
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Doctors

549
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,712
All the old people in the building

550
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
Call Everett

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Where is the UN

552
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Riddle to do that

553
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Rick Rude

554
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Little

555
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Amateur pet peeves

556
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,872
We're done we're done

557
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
John Donne

558
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
John Donne

559
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Holy

560
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
That was a roller coaster

561
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
My favorite part

562
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,240
For sure though is that it begins

563
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Freak out

564
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
With him talking about how it's amateurish

565
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,224
On radio shows when you hear someone say hello hello

566
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,320
Screaming about how this keeps happening on his show

567
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
That's the most temperature is

568
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,560
Not being able to roll with the f****** punch constantly

569
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,680
Freaking out whenever you have like a tech difficulties that your million-dollar Studio

570
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,336
Yeah that's amateurish in the middle of f****** nowhere

571
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
Are where all the sudden the microphone cuts out and I just got to toss it aside and continue in the goddamn I don't stop

572
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:54,624
Scream at the bartender

573
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Unable

574
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,976
Stand up

575
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
Shouldn't be expected to be able to handle.

576
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,144
Super Idaho 20-something years on a professional level

577
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Probably should be able to

578
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Before the lights go out

579
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
That's a challenge but you should be able to handle

580
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
White goes off

581
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,384
I'll be completely f***** up by it

582
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Military

583
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,480
You're doing a month of shows

584
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
At a certain place

585
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
And the Mike

586
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Keeps going out

587
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
Again and again we can't handle it

588
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,560
To talk to the manager or

589
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
The guy behind the tech booth and figure out what's going on with the mic going out

590
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Possible to fix

591
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
I would argue your bad performer

592
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
You're not

593
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Karen

594
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
The other word I would use

595
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
Amateur

596
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Little kids freak out

597
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,976
Give me chills a little bit

598
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Redpoint

599
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Just of the

600
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Like it real intense anger

601
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
There's a there's a level of repertoire

602
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,008
Stops being performative and starts being a representation of psychosis

603
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Yeah but you're like

604
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Get you but you do it 30 more time than you

605
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,456
You need maybe or it's filling time

606
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
Might have realized how

607
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
I got another 20 seconds to break I could just say

608
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
Done done done over and over again

609
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,488
We'll get there we'll get to the brain

610
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,048
RimTyme continue the show does not matter

611
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,864
Regions Bank in on the temp here and

612
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
Ready for

613
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
The 2020 election

614
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Basically

615
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
The two possibilities one Trump wins or Trump win

616
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
Lab but it looks like 5

617
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,944
Because there's a

618
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
115

619
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
Rotation

620
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Truck Yeah

621
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
We're in the middle of what will be

622
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
Contested

623
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Election

624
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Ariane top

625
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
Protect this country

626
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Civil War

627
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Everyone is being approached

628
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
Will you support

629
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Against President Trump

630
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
I hope

631
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
So you're most part there's a coup

632
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,344
Would be learned about already on Alex's show because

633
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
Joe Biden have to go

634
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
Talk s*** on the Bailey show unveiled

635
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,608
Hey I think Trump's insane if you might try and stay in power

636
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Obviously

637
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Play hymns

638
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
That's cool

639
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,336
So in order to defend his argument Alex has a couple of articles

640
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
That he's using

641
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
As I could

642
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
The big tent poles here

643
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
But you try

644
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
Relations America

645
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Democratic unraveling

646
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
The Armed Forces will be needed to remove Trump

647
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
Then you can test the election anyway

648
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
He will be removed by the US Military

649
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
Naturally Alex has not read this article in the Foreign Affairs and honestly probably used

650
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,688
It's a pretty Savage laying out of the various ways that are country

651
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,040
Structure and government has been usurped by Trump in the right-wing drive for power

652
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
It's honestly pretty fair hand

653
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:42,464
Essential pieces of this article is that erosion of norms in the structure of our society is a gradual process

654
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
But they clap

655
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Come very fast

656
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
It's very well-articulated In this passage

657
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,704
Quote as James Robinson and I argue in our recent book The Narrow corridor

658
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,104
Democratic institutions restrained elected leaders by enabling a delicate balance of oversight by different branches of government

659
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
A legislature and the Judiciary

660
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
And political action by Regular People

661
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,528
Weather in the form of voting and elections are exerting pressure via protest

662
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
But Democratic institutions rest on Norms

663
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
Compromise cooperation respect for true

664
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,024
And are bolstered by an active self-confidence citizen

665
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
When Democratic Values come under attack in the pricing

666
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Civil Society or country lies

667
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
The institutional safeguards lose their power

668
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
Under such conditions

669
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
The transgressions of those in power go on punished

670
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
IStore become normalized

671
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,152
The gradual erosion of checks and balances dusk

672
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
To Sunoco

673
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
That's a pretty fair assessment to

674
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
You know

675
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
Article argues that Trump has been playing authoritarian

676
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,928
Play book since he began his present

677
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,280
Special concerns about Russian interference in the u.s. election

678
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Refusing to disclose

679
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
The tax returns open

680
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Presume

681
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
Metservice family's financial interest

682
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Vilifying Hispanic and Muslim Americans

683
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Propagating conspiracy theories

684
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
And relentlessly lying to

685
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,384
The president has left democratic

686
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
These actions not only weaken the institutions that are supposed

687
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,040
Restrained president-elect

688
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
Creating a constituency that unconditionally supports Trump

689
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
I don't fear that the Democrats

690
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Play Power

691
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:22,048
The author Daron acemoglu is a professor of economics

692
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
MIT

693
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
It discusses how nothing is certain

694
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
He's going to be

695
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
If it does happen

696
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
Going to be a long painful process

697
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,616
That's probably impossible if Trump is re-elected

698
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,200
He's consistent pattern of behaving as a singular

699
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
Dictators

700
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
The Makar system function would continue

701
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
And smuggling is of the opinion

702
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
That's it

703
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
It's really nothing that could stop the administration

704
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
And everything

705
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
From collapsing

706
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:59,680
Even if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the upcoming election

707
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Front damaged that it will be powerless to fix

708
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,104
It wasn't addresses the Deep structural problems that propelled trumpets office

709
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
In the first place

710
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Such a nice recognition

711
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Attracted

712
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
It's not a easy fix even if

713
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Local has nothing to do with it

714
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,576
Contested election or the military being used to remove Trump

715
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
I want to see those things as a clear indication that he didn't read this article or he has no interest in discussing what it actually says

716
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,584
The line Alex is taking out of context ghost or paragraph

717
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Discussing how Trump is not at this point

718
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
Completely free from all institutional

719
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Constraint

720
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,824
There's some judges were pushing back on his clearly illegal executive orders

721
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:47,552
The Armed Forces may be able to restrain him as well as evidenced by the force will rebuke you received from Former Defense

722
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
Secretary James Mattis

723
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
After threatening to deploy the US Military

724
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
The National Guard again

725
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Protesters

726
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
But it would be a sad day if Americans had to

727
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Depend on the military to save their democracy

728
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
And the trend is toward fewer not more checks

729
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
On the president's power

730
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,496
If the last remaining restraints giveaway the fall towards autocracy will be

731
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
That's a sentence

732
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Military resist

733
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
Distance to Trump using the Army again

734
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Protesters

735
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:18,528
Which ends

736
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
The point where none of our ends

737
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Students of any ability to contain the unchecked power

738
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
Aspiring dictator

739
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
You have to speculate about what would happen

740
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,840
That's not saying the same thing Alex's claiming today

741
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,936
Anyway I went to the liar and this is a good but depressing Artica

742
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,776
Particularly in the context of drop just commuting Rodger Stone

743
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,592
You almost certainly carried out to advance the interests of trumpets

744
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,176
Yeah I really am I'm really disappointed

745
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
It seems like he made a grave miscalculation

746
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
In not

747
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
Cozying up to the millet

748
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
You know like from day one but Ryan

749
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
Yeah but he's just been doing a really shity job so it's almost like his personality

750
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
From really taking advantage

751
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
Of what a demagogue

752
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Do in Houston

753
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Like this would be

754
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
This would be a dictatorship

755
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
You know like three years ago if you would done it right

756
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
It's not hard

757
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
It will look at the look at the Council of Foreign Relations list of things that Trump is doing to a road the door

758
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
That all happened before he got elect

759
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
What's the list

760
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,232
That he didn't do during the

761
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
The campaign

762
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,632
You're talking about from this article

763
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,520
Demonizing his phone

764
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,640
Openly pursue policies that service financial interest

765
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:55,040
Position to do that that openly pursues his financial

766
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
UPS broke the law on day one as election you can't use the presidency

767
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
Yourself when you don't have the Press

768
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
The illusion of the presidency

769
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,496
That's not the power running for president to sell books

770
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
Which is also an issue we should

771
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
Corruption of the office subscription

772
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
The process

773
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
I guess

774
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
Look let's not get too deep into the weeds

775
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Agreed politely

776
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
When will leave it there for now cuz I was another article

777
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
But how does it kind of went all that s***

778
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
Is anyone out of the Stanford

779
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
Anyone

780
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
Will not leave will be arrested

781
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Numbers

782
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
We try

783
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
To help face prison

784
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
Denise Alford Advocate not Stanford

785
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Article from the washer

786
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,719
This article is really just a legal analysis about how unlikely it is the Trump refuse to step down if he loses

787
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
November

788
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,095
The reason for that is because in order for him to pull that off he would need to persuade the in

789
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,655
Entire executive branch to do so as well

790
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
When doing so puts on a very serious legal Jeopardy

791
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
40 pieces well summed up by the closing

792
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Paragraph

793
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,199
Quote nothing can with total certainty I'm sure a normal transition of power from as abnormal present

794
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Has Donald Trump

795
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,575
It's vital to recognize that if Trump tries to retain power illegitimate

796
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
He'll need help from his cabinet

797
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,231
Members of the cabinet to go on the record Legendary Ultimate urine

798
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Student of the laws of the United States

799
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
It would be

800
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
A lot of people

801
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
Terrified legal gods

802
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
Oh no not legal consequences there's no way to get around legal I understand

803
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,991
A gigantic

804
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Which

805
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,111
That mean it's not inconceivable but it's not as big like

806
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,791
The issue here is that whether or not Trump would be able to successfully do

807
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
Even gesturing towards it is a problem

808
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
Yes

809
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,703
And even if he doesn't have an executive branch

810
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,543
Fulfill the duties that you need to run a government care even if he still said I'm

811
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Illegitimate president

812
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,383
Causes just as big

813
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247
Anyway this is something

814
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,087
The point of this article because Alex is supposed to love America

815
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
Constitution

816
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Yep

817
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
It's not like his article is even taking Trump losing as a certain

818
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
Do you like it explicitly says quote

819
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Legitimately wins an election

820
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,887
So be at the end of America

821
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,495
So

822
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
Bombshell proof

823
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
Obaasan Arrow got infected so it's bombshell proof that the

824
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
No bombshell proof that it is not an epidemic

825
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
And that's a real cool now or something

826
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,183
Salute Smoking Gun on top of Smoking Gun on top of

827
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
Cookie jar on top of

828
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
Absolutely ridiculous

829
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,631
The covid-19 is a giant fraud every level

830
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
Design for planetary takeover

831
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Cover

832
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,751
Depopulation

833
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
On the cdc's on website

834
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
They say that covid-19

835
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Is not

836
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
And that actually

837
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
Nose-diving death

838
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
And that's why every headline you see says

839
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
America's

840
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
America stock

841
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
America

842
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
On

843
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Believable

844
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,111
This is just a national file

845
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,927
National file articles

846
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
The CDC reports from March

847
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,815
Covid-19 deaths at a sudden Spike and then immediately proceeded to drop

848
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
And if the dropped

849
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Continues

850
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,679
The viral disease will no longer be considered an epidemic

851
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
International stand

852
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
That's great well then I'm glad to know that may was a good month for us and I'm sure things will continue

853
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,711
Even if you just take that is true that now it's a still misreporting this

854
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,855
A story using the CDC says that this is correct

855
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Possible threshold

856
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Future which is bad word

857
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:55,839
Lincoln National website data for the weekend on July

858
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
On the very top of the page

859
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Key update section they say

860
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,591
The percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS code to the viruses virus that causes covid-19

861
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
Decreased slightly from last week

862
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
This past weekend

863
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Included a holiday

864
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Testing and Reporting

865
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,903
Mortality attributed to covid-19 decrease compared to last week and is currently out of epidemic threshold

866
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,487
But will likely increase as additional death certificates

867
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
You're just making

868
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,887
Stuff up by misrepresenting things that are on the CDC update page 1

869
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
For context it's all met

870
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
We're just called

871
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Lion

872
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,287
There are other things are on this page to that should worry people

873
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
I mean

874
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,711
There is a there's a slight total decrease of national numbers for percentages of tests coming back positive

875
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,807
But there's a couple of regions in the country that are really pushing those numbers up

876
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,719
The South Central Region which covers Arkansas Louisiana New Mexico Oklahoma and Texas were showing positive test

877
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
16.8%

878
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,631
Also the southeastern region covering Kentucky Tennessee Mississippi Georgia

879
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,167
North and South Carolina and

880
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
Florida was reflect

881
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
2014

882
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
.1

883
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
Percent positive rate

884
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,127
These dudes cherry-picking whatever soda out of context line they can find out make their arguments

885
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
But the totality of the information

886
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,991
I'm a very Pages they linked to as sources refute the things

887
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
They're saying

888
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,295
So I don't know

889
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
I don't know

890
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Ime

891
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
I don't know what

892
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
You can't

893
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
You can't do it

894
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
I mean

895
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
I get

896
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Constitutions already out the window

897
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
We lost we lost battle

898
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
And I have a little

899
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
Is the concert

900
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
To do some was still an effective would be applied to

901
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
And it doesn't seem to be doing

902
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
So this this s*** is

903
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Too dangerous

904
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Next clip

905
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
To talking about the Big Sur

906
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Supreme Court

907
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
Decision of the last week that gave Oklahoma

908
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,143
I-20

909
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
To say about this

910
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
Before he gets

911
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
Teasing what's coming up I have really excited I've never pays off

912
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,663
Bohemian Grove

913
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
What Supreme Court

914
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Oklahoma

915
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,063
But I can defend a

916
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
Convicted child rapist

917
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
I kidding

918
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
But no joke

919
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,303
I have no idea what this Bohemian Grove knows is

920
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,167
Distracted by whatever you going to go on with it and get back to it but no

921
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,239
Buck yes

922
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
You're welcome

923
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,895
What's up with Malik

924
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,247
Stuff about the Oklahoma story is not true

925
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,855
Last week the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that about half of Oklahoma is taken

926
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Creekland

927
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
And somewhat sovereign

928
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
For the state of Oklahoma

929
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:08,095
It's really complicated but essentially what will end up happening is if there's Major Crimes

930
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,935
Committed by a native person inside the area considered Creek territory

931
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,751
They cannot be Tried by the state of Oklahoma

932
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,799
It has to be handled by the federal

933
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,663
Smaller crimes like misdemeanors or civil matters those involving

934
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Will be handled by tribal courts

935
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,063
According to NPR Arizona New Mexico

936
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
This is not an attempt to

937
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,695
Protect someone who sexually assaulted a child but it's easy to create that Miss

938
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,255
Information of a case that led to the Supreme Court ruling

939
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,839
Decent question was mcgirt versus Oklahoma

940
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,935
Jimcy mcgirt what I was a member of the Seminole Nation

941
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,983
Sex crimes against the child on

942
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Hungry clam

943
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,079
The appealing of the case was never about getting him acquitted

944
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,151
The argument was that the state of Oklahoma had no jurisdiction

945
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Try the case

946
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
I need me to be dried

947
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Federal court

948
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
Alex love sovereignty so you think you'd be in favor of it

949
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
For others

950
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
He's trying to turn the story about it

951
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:07,999
A treaty between the United States government of the creek people being honored into a story about protecting pedophiles

952
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
You really getting to be a one-trick pony

953
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,775
Half of Oklahoma in order to make sure that the Oklahoma State can enforce doesn't get to that point

954
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:25,663
He's just trying to pretend that it's a thing where they're like they're trying to get this guy off the hook by

955
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
Tribal court is at 11 Mall

956
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,039
Federal court

957
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
Almost certainly convicted

958
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
It's really

959
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
Just more about honoring this treaty

960
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
So the American government

961
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Of the Infowars

962
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Offering

963
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,311
For today in the news

964
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,127
Monkey see monkey do

965
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
That's search engine

966
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,455
Monkeys now.

967
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
In India

968
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
In Africa

969
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
Southeast Asia

970
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
Monkeys have all Mountain scene

971
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,255
Picking up mascot of trash piles

972
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Demond

973
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Arbella primate

974
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,935
Different types of monkeys are doing this but are you

975
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,751
Think of humans is more advanced as successful

976
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
1

977
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
What are you doing

978
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,687
I'm putting the mask on

979
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
I think it's entirely possible that it's a coincidence

980
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,855
That doesn't mean anything that a couple people

981
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
Go to liquidity of crab

982
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Pizza Ranch

983
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,815
So smart

984
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,655
I was trying to get to the bottom of Nevada

985
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:55,519
It's just a video from India wear a monkey find the scarf on the street and puts it over his head

986
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,871
We're doing the gesture not unlike what you see people doing they threw a scarf over their shoulder

987
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,943
The monkey is very good

988
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
The scarf over his face and kind of looks like a man

989
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551
It's a really cute video If

990
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Did you know

991
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,671
Did you know that there is a mainstream movie where a monkey

992
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,279
You know call the lab.

993
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
So

994
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
This kind of does illustrated

995
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Disturbing trend of monkey

996
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
Leather mimicking our Behavior

997
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
We all wear masks

998
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
I meant to be like us

999
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Monkeys are doing it too cuz they know where

1000
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,919
The only problem with his theory is that the video has been reposted for at least a year

1001
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:41,599
Posted by susanti Ananda of the Indian Forest Service

1002
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
But it's not a new video

1003
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,279
Also I'm really interested in the theory that outside by monkeys copying our Behavior

1004
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:55,679
That's something I don't have anywhere near the amount of patients it would take to unpack

1005
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,727
Haha

1006
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
Is basically just him

1007
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,079
Seeing some kind of piece of viral content and then making up

1008
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,431
Story about it

1009
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,735
Also I think the monkeys would probably

1010
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
Copy other behaviors

1011
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,927
They had a fundamental understanding

1012
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,511
Stock market

1013
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,631
Lightstar successfulness

1014
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
I'm going to go with this and let me see if you can get the ref

1015
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Forthright

1016
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,007
Damn you

1017
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
Responsible

1018
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,967
Seems likely

1019
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,111
Take responsibility for decisions

1020
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,183
Going to present without Kombat though I think

1021
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,999
This could look real bad in hindsight

1022
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,583
As I told you first

1023
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
The White House

1024
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Troy

1025
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,359
Troy game

1026
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,687
Vaccines

1027
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,647
Impressions

1028
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Content getting

1029
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,743
The Trump is

1030
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Medical experts

1031
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
The middle of a pandemic

1032
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
End up looking real bad is a present

1033
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
Okay or even worse in the future

1034
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
So what you're saying is

1035
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:40,127
Alex is claiming to directly influence the removal of medical experts in the mid

1036
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
The pandemic

1037
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,503
I don't think that I think that would be more of an admission of guilt

1038
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,319
Really look pretty bad

1039
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,695
Now I would start fantasizing about Trump needs to have fauci

1040
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Bill Gates murder

1041
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,143
Ex-president

1042
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
Henna politically present as hard as you want them people back

1043
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
Southeast goes away Along trip

1044
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,127
Bill Gates

1045
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,943
Vacation together supposed to ever see him again.

1046
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,967
Black women

1047
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
Chrysler Dodge

1048
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Really

1049
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Society paid in full

1050
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Let's continue

1051
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:29,791
Man Alex complains all the time about disappearing people at

1052
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Disappeared

1053
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,703
I guess if he's kind of wanting his enemies to go on a long

1054
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,055
Camping trip because Trump is the real deal the real deal

1055
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
I mean it's just silly

1056
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
This morning

1057
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
On the 10th

1058
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
Good morning

1059
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Alex

1060
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Was driving around or something

1061
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,623
I saw some joggers

1062
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:59,487
I don't know if yells at them but he does what he does write a weird story about them

1063
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
When I was in

1064
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Scripture area

1065
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
What's

1066
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
She looks like

1067
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,591
Some joggers walkers

1068
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
Call my phone

1069
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,759
Make a call

1070
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
The whole sidewalk and everything

1071
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,183
Get off the phone and I'm watching them

1072
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,743
Black Chinese

1073
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
Iron Man what

1074
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
And they start walking down

1075
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
At me angry

1076
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,935
I didn't videotape but I don't want to antagonize

1077
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Osher

1078
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
You hate antagonizing people

1079
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
With the window shop

1080
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,383
Wasn't enough that I got in at the windows up

1081
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
They were social distancing

1082
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
Probably

1083
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,783
We're working for a tech company probably Chinese citizens

1084
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Because there's our phone track them

1085
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
The follow the AI to prepare themselves

1086
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Republic

1087
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,935
Watch the next level of conformity

1088
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
A hundred yards away

1089
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
And waiting

1090
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
For me

1091
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Quiet

1092
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
Barry

1093
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,271
It's interesting how many assumptions he makes in that story that are come

1094
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
Completely unfounded

1095
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:33,951
But he decides that they must be Chinese citizens out here working for a tech company or used to being monitored

1096
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:39,327
Myself

1097
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:45,727
I think it's entirely possible that they knew it was Alex

1098
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
Inversion of it

1099
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,735
There's a hundred explanations that have nothing to do with math

1100
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Their social didn't know it all

1101
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,623
Or if they are cute

1102
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,743
Minorities

1103
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
Did not go well

1104
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,631
Just kept thinking during that story like the next thing that Alex

1105
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Say to some

1106
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
Other human being is

1107
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,495
Why do these walls have so many pads on

1108
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,055
Like that's what you should say after that story

1109
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,151
Insane

1110
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
Retelling of things

1111
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,015
Let's look at the concrete things that happened in the story

1112
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
Alex was in his truck

1113
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,879
Houston a couple people

1114
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:38,719
Yes those are the only things that are concrete

1115
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
Just what happened Alex a famous person

1116
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Is in a truck

1117
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,911
Track of court

1118
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,663
Pick out of a crowd don't recall the Chinese government having anything to do with that

1119
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
But I could be wrong

1120
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
This is one of those things

1121
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,367
Gaston

1122
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Caesars

1123
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,951
Concrete facts of the story are thin

1124
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:16,351
Most of the meat is just things that he's making.

1125
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,959
You're not wrong

1126
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
You're not wrong

1127
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,503
Still really really boring

1128
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Stand-up did not

1129
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
Not go well true

1130
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
So

1131
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Alex

1132
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,439
Has learned that there's this guy named named kid

1133
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,327
Texas emergency

1134
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Division

1135
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Chief

1136
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
I need an interview that was discussing

1137
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
How

1138
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,751
Instances where

1139
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,055
We might want to be suggesting people wear masks

1140
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
At home

1141
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,919
They're going to force you to wear a mask

1142
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
And who plays this

1143
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,295
The reason I kept this in

1144
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
Is that you can tell

1145
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
Alex Azar

1146
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
T-jack about interrupting

1147
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
Is

1148
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
Texas chief

1149
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
Nim Kidd

1150
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,655
You always beating him kid

1151
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
Behind

1152
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Governor wearing his mask

1153
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
He says do not

1154
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
Your house Autumn ask but also

1155
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Jr house

1156
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
Wear a mask

1157
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,967
Because you're such a bad person

1158
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,015
You're so evil you're so dangerous

1159
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,623
Today is we need to do that when we're in our homes also

1160
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,951
As you know I'm a lifelong San Antonio on grew up there

1161
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
Worked there for many years

1162
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,559
And I know how many multi-generational families that we have

1163
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,887
And while we believe the community is doing a great job

1164
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
The rules

1165
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
Outside of the home

1166
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,799
We really need to be thinking about doing the same thing when were inside the home

1167
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
All of us

1168
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Star

1169
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
Take bullet

1170
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
Disease none of us are immune from

1171
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,223
In the fact that we need to get across

1172
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
In order to protect

1173
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
Darcelle's Juanita

1174
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
Protect our families and our love

1175
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
We really need to be thinking about

1176
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
The care that we provide

1177
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
Inside the home right now

1178
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:21,023
To make sure that we're not spreading this disease inside the home and then making it come outside

1179
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
So let me get this straight with your fact

1180
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
Actively saying is that

1181
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
People should be wearing masks

1182
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Inside their own homes now

1183
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Ryan I'm saying if you can

1184
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,775
Can't socially distant and can't socially isolator if you've been out in

1185
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
Exposing yourself

1186
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
And you haven't

1187
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
Decontaminated yourself good enough when you get home

1188
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
If you have someone that has

1189
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:44,831
Underlying medical conditions that I can Sweeten

1190
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,855
Play with

1191
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Riza Bello

1192
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
Texas emergency management system

1193
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
Damn kid

1194
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:55,839
Alex had to interrupt because you realize that it was making too much

1195
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,447
Any longer is going to be

1196
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,727
Completely clear what he was.

1197
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,543
Here's a version that Alex wants his audience

1198
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,335
Believe is what kid

1199
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:13,247
You Texans need to wear masks when you leave the house at now

1200
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:18,879
The further they clip later became more clear that you know what he was saying

1201
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:25,023
Kid was not saying anything about mandating people to wear masks

1202
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:31,423
Consider

1203
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,751
It may have people in the house already higher risk Coronavirus

1204
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
If you're in such a household and you're not able to

1205
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Protect yourself

1206
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,711
Consider to wear mask inside to save your grandmother's lights

1207
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,343
This is a big slip up on Alex's bar that could have easily been any preparation for his show

1208
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,415
If you even gave me single s*** about the things

1209
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:57,279
Turn it off so it doesn't contradict

1210
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
Your narrative about it

1211
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
So are you saying that we need

1212
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
Yeah I mean

1213
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,151
But you know it's great that Alex is able to get around that and try and

1214
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,271
Is bias

1215
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,719
Terrible news out of my you don't want this guy off saying

1216
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
We about to make sense

1217
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Me too

1218
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
This entire episode

1219
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
The comeback

1220
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
I'll get into the

1221
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
Two-player games

1222
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,943
Will play the director of the UN emergency response operation

1223
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
His counterpart that wrote this up

1224
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
He's an emergency

1225
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,855
He gets his orders down to the CDC

1226
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:58,463
We're coming

1227
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
Your children your parents we're coming into your house

1228
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
He has even got the memo yet

1229
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,759
Nonsense 37 nightclub

1230
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,575
She already but

1231
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
I think you're before getting a

1232
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,695
Global emergency response

1233
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,511
Disasters and medical crises

1234
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,631
He is drooling

1235
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,215
Umwa Showdown to the NIH CDC

1236
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Who

1237
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
This man takes his orders from

1238
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,359
The Texas division of Emergency Management

1239
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Who says

1240
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,783
Leave your house without a mask and you'd wear one in your house

1241
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,599
And then Australia in Spain

1242
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
Houses

1243
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Taking

1244
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
The families away

1245
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,511
Breaking them up

1246
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,303
And at the moment

1247
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
The most parts

1248
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
The world

1249
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
Transmission

1250
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Actually happen

1251
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
Any country

1252
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
It's happening

1253
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
In the house

1254
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
In some senses transmission

1255
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
Has been taken off the streets

1256
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
And pushed back

1257
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
Family units

1258
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
No we need to go

1259
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
A look inside

1260
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
And removed

1261
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
And isolate them

1262
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Something the fight

1263
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:38,559
So first things first vun Emergency Management people are not in charge of the Texas division

1264
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Emergency room

1265
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,935
There's a lot of local jurisdiction

1266
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
Planning structure

1267
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,031
Ultimately it all goes back to the governor

1268
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
I was able to find the 2020 Texas emergency management structure document which discusses the Texas Emergency Management

1269
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Council

1270
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,479
Business quotes

1271
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:00,831
Composed of state agencies and nongovernmental organizations appointed by the governor

1272
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:06,719
The council was established to advise and assist the governor and all matters related to disaster mitigation preparedness

1273
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Response and Recovery

1274
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:13,119
This is no Formal Connection to the body the doctor Michael Ryan is the executive director of which is

1275
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,167
Is the the World Health Organization

1276
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Health emergencies program

1277
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:20,031
Probably sounds kind of scary

1278
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
But I want to take it entirely out of context

1279
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,175
This is from a media briefing on the virus from March 30th

1280
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,271
Steps that dr. Ryan describes are not relevant to our situation

1281
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
At all

1282
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:37,951
In the full context of his comments were discussing their monitoring methodology that could be put in place of cases went down to

1283
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Very low numbers

1284
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
If you want me over a few cases identified a day

1285
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:46,911
A state or country can have the ability to trace a contract contact

1286
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,471
And if someone gets sick provide them with a safe place

1287
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,287
Gene away from home

1288
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
And keep spreading the disease

1289
01:06:54,335 --> 01:07:00,479
If you listen to the four responses question even says that it isn't something you can really do effectively when he has thousands of cases of

1290
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:05,599
Has been currently tracking over 50,000

1291
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,695
To say that most of the country is not in the position where anything dr. Ryan was saying

1292
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
Back in March

1293
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
Which is relevant

1294
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,071
Dr. Ryan was talking about what a country could do once it is pushed

1295
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,607
Transmission off the streets

1296
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
And into the house

1297
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,983
The tragedy of Alex

1298
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Nope

1299
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,895
So I don't know I'm so contact clip of this World Health Organization guy

1300
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Or you can wreck

1301
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Acknowledge that it has nothing

1302
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Things to do with

1303
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
Seems like he's dealing with

1304
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
Seriously

1305
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Kind of fallacies

1306
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,439
Or it's just like hey I've been denying this

1307
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,463
For so long

1308
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Even though the evidence

1309
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
This is now completely

1310
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
Otherwise I'm going to look

1311
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Even though I am a moron

1312
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
I want to look

1313
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Navigate me to

1314
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
I would do with you

1315
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:02,431
So Alex has big top story which is the coup against Trump

1316
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
Supposed to be coming

1317
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,295
And so

1318
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Coming in here

1319
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Oh my God

1320
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
What I'm going to do this right now

1321
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
I'm going to mention this

1322
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,935
I'm going to get this coming out of the gates at 6 after nobody in studio with me

1323
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,007
We'll talk about this at first

1324
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,455
I've got a stack of news articles have a coup against the present

1325
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
Physically with the US Military

1326
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
Danny's house

1327
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
As we speak

1328
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
In order to

1329
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,879
Hammer home the concept

1330
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,743
Openstax

1331
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
Election will be

1332
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,559
Detective

1333
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
Writers article

1334
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
So

1335
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,079
Now Bella Taylor just so much of this

1336
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,431
Left coming up

1337
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
I want to find this operation

1338
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
Products the same time

1339
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Now's the time to do it

1340
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,255
I can't possibly imagine doing such a shity job and then still insisting for money

1341
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Happening

1342
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:28,191
Top stories

1343
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
Things to a Holt

1344
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
Allison Tire thing with gold

1345
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Zacks attack

1346
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,663
Drunk would probably make more sense if Trump hadn't made former Goldman Sachs

1347
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,479
Executive Steve mnuchin the Secretary of the Treasury

1348
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,783
His campaign had been run by former Goldman Sachs

1349
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,415
Employee Steve original chief financial advisor wasn't former Goldman Sachs CEO oh Gary Cohn

1350
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
What's goes on and on related information

1351
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,255
There's no conflict

1352
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,535
Between Trump and Goldman Sachs

1353
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,327
Text spy without my water pretend

1354
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,983
This article that Alex can't remember anything about has to do with Goldman Sachs advising investors to hedge their positions through the end of the

1355
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,055
Since they predict Market volatility around the election

1356
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,711
They're not predicting a contested election the same way I was just trying to use the term we're both candidates say that they're the rightful winner

1357
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:18,367
Google delay the announcement of the winner

1358
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,927
They cite increases in mail-in ballots

1359
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
The time it takes for

1360
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,023
Count those and virus possibly voting schedule

1361
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,071
As reasons to be a cautious investor

1362
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
There were a bunch of up

1363
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,935
Sundown zv5 week between the 2000 election and the

1364
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
Supreme Court naming Bush the winner

1365
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,775
This is more or less just a financial business

1366
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,335
Advising investors that some similar s*** is

1367
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
Probable this year

1368
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
This is just short of

1369
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Proof of a coup

1370
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
But I guess if that's our Alex wants to play things

1371
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
That's that's

1372
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
I mean

1373
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
If there was a cool

1374
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,903
Goldman Sachs is on Trump

1375
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,231
Come on man

1376
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,839
So Alex brings in Savannah Hernandez

1377
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,935
They've been put out since that out there or not burning

1378
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983
Whenever I open the homeless person

1379
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,007
Situation all over

1380
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,919
Lambe's Royal salute

1381
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,759
It said you just get him by

1382
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,575
Kind of

1383
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
I think they may do though

1384
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
They may have

1385
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,207
Television media come on

1386
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:30,559
The night of the election and say obeid one-by-one even though Trump did win

1387
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,911
Censorship

1388
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,191
Just like they stop

1389
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,239
I'm talking about hydroxychloroquine

1390
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Orthopnea

1391
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
Doctors from talking about

1392
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
And then so they'll come in and they'll say all by one-by-one and then trouble saying no

1393
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,111
Find anyone who will be the president versus Media

1394
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Show me the playing field

1395
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Question is

1396
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,767
One option is attack

1397
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
Next time to mount up in

1398
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
We'll make our own autonomous Zone

1399
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:15,359
That's what we can attack we can do that too is patients we can sit back and wait

1400
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:22,271
Auntie okay let's see what happens in the election night let's hope for a good thing maybe

1401
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Beastly

1402
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,207
Go to the hills Mount up get emergency water get by it you know a mountain

1403
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,511
Get a bunch of guns and ammo and I'm doing both

1404
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
But just you three

1405
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863
Taco thing we have to wonder now is

1406
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,447
For example if we want to attack or if we want to wait no

1407
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,007
Top measure

1408
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Choose before we have the choice to take

1409
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:53,247
I mean obviously the answer was when bolsonaro tested positive for covid-19 you giant bunch

1410
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,599
Well

1411
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,207
Love any of this b******* they've already hit all the

1412
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,303
Well I know that

1413
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,119
Alex's broadcast Style

1414
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,167
Simultaneously

1415
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,447
Periodically

1416
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,471
So it's not like

1417
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,407
The world has gotten more and more

1418
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
I'm saying over the past

1419
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
6 months

1420
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,247
You know it.

1421
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
I feel like there's more Danger

1422
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
Game

1423
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,071
I am not comfortable with

1424
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,119
The extent to which these conversations

1425
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,935
Super normalize

1426
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Why you with me

1427
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
People are so

1428
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
F****** stupid not outsmart

1429
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,567
Because they're they're murderers

1430
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
It's not about

1431
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,711
It's not about a fear of like Owen doing

1432
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,783
The unknown unknown person who listens

1433
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
Stuart to Alex

1434
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
Yes

1435
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:07,231
One thing I think is really interesting is it appears that

1436
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
Over Trump

1437
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Bulshit

1438
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,327
Interesting to me

1439
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,631
He's coming from a position of like

1440
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Yeah look

1441
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,959
He's not going to do it

1442
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,751
He's not going to do the things we want

1443
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
And Alex doesn't improve

1444
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,383
Trump wants to let them steal the election from Trump okay

1445
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
Decision

1446
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,967
We're not going to let them take our country

1447
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
So

1448
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,807
Contact tracers are coming to our house

1449
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:36,159
By the way they're going to be political there the youth Brigade Obama wanted

1450
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:43,583
Hey we want to be on the field we want to be on the front lines we are the tip of the spear Trump has let them truckers let them lie about us too

1451
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,631
Lucinda submission we're still fighting so hey

1452
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,423
You know at the end of the day

1453
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,471
Are we fighting for Trump or are we find

1454
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,775
For America on fighting for marriage

1455
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:02,527
So wow not on the same page

1456
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:06,623
Where is starting to lean more towards the Fuentes

1457
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:12,511
Wing of the murder everybody party

1458
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Trump's not going to do it

1459
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
Yeah we'll see where that goes

1460
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,471
See how long you can rationalize working for the company she works for

1461
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:25,311
Comes in and she's got some

1462
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Some dumb s***

1463
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
To say about how like

1464
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,199
All these ideas not going to leave office because of Hillary

1465
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:37,855
David laying the groundwork for this got into Office Clinton is already come out so many times

1466
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,903
Well what if

1467
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,303
Losses in 2020 he's not going to leave the White House so she's an already laying the groundwork

1468
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:52,959
It's all good well to talk about people like Hillary raising concerns about Trump not leaving office

1469
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,775
If you don't point out the Trump has a long history of

1470
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Joking

1471
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,079
He's not going to leave office

1472
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,223
Yeah cancel National

1473
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,855
Scream 4 more years for more years I only say make it 12 years ago

1474
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,183
Or there was a tweet from June 2019

1475
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Quote

1476
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:20,607
A pool should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper these failing New York Times

1477
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,399
Amazon lobbyists Washington Post

1478
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:27,775
Disgrace to our country

1479
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:34,175
Good news is at the end of six years after America's been great

1480
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,199
Parentheses

1481
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:41,599
Do you think the people would demand that I stay longer

1482
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,159
Forever gone

1483
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:49,279
Or there was a closed-door speech that he gave in front of Republican donors at Mar-A-Lago and March

1484
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,071
2018 discussed how

1485
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
President of China just gave himself lifetime

1486
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911

He's now president for Life president-for-life know he's great

1488
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,799
He was able to do that I think it's great

1489
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,847
Maybe we'll have to get the shots

1490
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,407
Athlete article as a listing of at least

1491
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
27 *

1492
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,015
Does Trump has made comments about how he should get more than two terms

1493
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,295
Since he's taken office

1494
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,599
There's not a normal thing for a human to do

1495
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,159
There's a couple of reasons why

1496
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,207
Someone would act like this and I'll get to that in a second

1497
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,791
I think it's important to point out that there is a massive difference

1498
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,839
Between the behavior of someone like Hillary

1499
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
And someone like Trump

1500
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
Circumstance

1501
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,215
Hillary is not a person who's able to make any real

1502
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,007
Decision in this situation

1503
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:35,615
She's a commentator who's expressed concern that a person will make a very

1504
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,943
Conversely Trump is the decision maker

1505
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
Legitimately he's the only person who can decide whether or not to throw this country into an even deeper existential crisis when the election

1506
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Results come in

1507
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,463
He alone is the either able to accept or reject

1508
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
A win or loss

1509
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
And the ramifications of that choice are almost

1510
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
Impossible to overstate

1511
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,215
When Hillary discusses he's concerned she's well within her right to do so and you're welcome to have your opinion about her opinion

1512
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
When Trump

1513
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,263
Uncle jokes

1514
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,567
Insisting on staying in office after two terms

1515
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
He's joking about something that is in his power

1516
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,199
Whether you believe he'd be able to pull it off or not

1517
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:16,831
You have the ability to cause the damage that a president not accepting the results of an election would cause

1518
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,879
And what he's doing is not joking

1519
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:23,487
There are only two possible explanations I can really come up with for why Trump would soak

1520
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Joke about that

1521
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,839
The first is to piss off his political opposition

1522
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,959
In that case we have a president who such a dick that he'll create the impression that he wants to overturn base against

1523
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,007
Douching

1524
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,615
That alone is disqualify a person to be a leader let alone someone worth taking serious

1525
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
The other possibility is the Trump thinks he should be present

1526
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
4life

1527
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:49,599
I don't think you can really but what about Hillary this I don't think that's Hillary

1528
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,671
Good good music

1529
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,791
Storming the capitol

1530
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,607
About it in that last

1531
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
Thousand armed people

1532
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,775
To storm the capitol

1533
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,847
I think about this I think about you know

1534
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:15,711
Is it time for Alex Jones Infowars to declare war on the Deep State and literally

1535
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
If we don't have a rash

1536
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
By October 31st

1537
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
2020

1538
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
A thousand armed men

1539
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
To meet us at the Texas Capitol

1540
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,719
And we'll set up our own autonomous Zone

1541
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:32,095
And we'll go wherever we need to go and drag out whoever we need to drag out by the Scruff of their neck

1542
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,911
Start to get some rest and get some action

1543
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,239
I don't want to do that I know you don't want to do that that's why we

1544
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,055
Take political action that's why we come on are everyday

1545
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:47,711
But it's reaching a point where yeah there is an active going on

1546
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,271
Listen

1547
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:55,903
I don't want to do the thing that for the past six months I've been screaming how great it would be to do

1548
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:01,791
You know if they don't do it they're going to have to make me do the thing that again I explicitly

1549
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:08,191
Do not absolutely want to do and have been saying that I know how I said Halloween because the only night we have a chance

1550
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
We can all be dressed up as we know when the planets align

1551
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,640
Has the power to break into

1552
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,224
I like it

1553
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
Dear

1554
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:25,088
I don't think it's a good plan.

1555
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,392
I'm also

1556
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
Is it time for us to declare war on the Deep State how many f****** times has Alex yelled about that

1557
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,840
State was poisoning Trump

1558
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
F****** Coke

1559
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,680
Like three years.

1560
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,520
So we know that

1561
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
Later this evening

1562
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:50,688
Rodger Clemens

1563
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
Clements twins

1564
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Whatever

1565
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:58,880
Alex Roberto Clemente the show that day Alex

1566
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Open slip

1567
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
Put it back on screen

1568
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,656
Developing Trump pardon Stone

1569
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Waking up

1570
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
President

1571
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,200
Hearthstone

1572
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:27,552
First of all Alex's wrong Rodger Clemens

1573
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:33,952
Clemency just reduces the penalty for a conviction but the crime is still on a person's records or Rodgers still a convicted

1574
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Itsowen

1575
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,560
If Trump legitimately thought that Rodger was wrongly convicted he would have pardoned

1576
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,352
But he didn't because that would be

1577
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
Probably be too messy

1578
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,448
On that

1579
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,728
I think

1580
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,824
Maybe I don't know clemency is a perfect male Road for corruption head

1581
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
Cuz then Rodger doesn't have to go to prison

1582
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,664
And you don't have to open up the box

1583
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
What could happen if you park

1584
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
Box was opened

1585
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,696
Entire prosecution

1586
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,144
Swept under the rug by I think that was that was more I wasn't good Stone wouldn't have been the one

1587
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,728
Accepting that stealing a complete election

1588
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,288
Probably with boxes

1589
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,568
I think I think

1590
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,176
The difference between those things of this such a bore of a discrete Act

1591
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
You know like

1592
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
Yeah

1593
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
This stuff

1594
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,040
Smaller and all that

1595
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:35,904
Does lions announce there's a lot of complexity to it were simple

1596
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
Yeah that's fair

1597
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
I think you could make a really

1598
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:43,840
Easier to digest argument about pardoning Rodger

1599
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,912
For trying to intimidate a witness

1600
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,472
That case

1601
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,776
It had to do with him trying to

1602
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:55,104
Yeah circumvent the law in order to help the Trump campaign

1603
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,712
I think it's a little easier

1604
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
Yeah with corruption

1605
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,576
I don't disagree with you at on a human level

1606
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,648
Favorite part of this

1607
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,672
Is

1608
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,464
How much of a chump Mueller is

1609
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,768
Like this entire like him

1610
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,792
Shawn Whitby

1611
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,816
Easiest conviction

1612
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,608
He had and that way

1613
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:19,680
Was ripped away from

1614
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
He is

1615
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,520
Failed in every possible way is hilarious

1616
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,640
Standing up for him or anything like that

1617
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,200
Interrupt

1618
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
You're right

1619
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
Don't know but that's what it's even funnier

1620
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,392
Cuz Trump made him look like

1621
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
Jump again

1622
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
You should really be embarrassed

1623
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:49,632
Alex the Trump was going to Pardon Rodger for the last week

1624
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,168
Please excuse for engaging in the

1625
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,752
Certain embarrassing radio play about a Rodgers going to die in jail

1626
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,568
Cuz he's such a hero

1627
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,848
If the whole point was to

1628
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:02,176
Please case to Trump for the pardon you already knew was coming

1629
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,224
Kind of makes the whole thing seem like an actor

1630
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,552
Almost like if you were just building up to the payoff that you knew was coming

1631
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,880
The drama of a pardon

1632
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:11,904
Not come

1633
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,440
Just the juice the rating

1634
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:24,960
Trying to will they work today, intention in order to

1635
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:32,128
How many people are going to TuneIn

1636
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,688
Start going on really frequently in the past

1637
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
Couple of weeks

1638
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,088
Is tonight the night that stone announces he's been pardoned

1639
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
Well

1640
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
I think you know you know

1641
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,024
You starts

1642
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,560
Talking some more about

1643
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
Is that amazing

1644
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Sure

1645
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,960
Imagine

1646
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,008
Of course

1647
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,568
Is a slightly different

1648
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
I actually think is worse

1649
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,384
It's weird because

1650
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
You can say there's enemies

1651
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
The freedom but

1652
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
To me the correct psychological

1653
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
Approach because

1654
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,856
Guarantee them is my

1655
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
I don't see them

1656
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:19,232
Freedom I think if you ask them they want to be free to just anybody

1657
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,072
Become his obstacles

1658
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,352
A freedom

1659
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,632
Nicole's of freedom

1660
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,680
And as soon as Americans

1661
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
You're not even

1662
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Art Willingham

1663
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
Fight for their freedom

1664
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
Like you said

1665
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,592
You're now an obstacle

1666
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,384
You're going to get run over

1667
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,200
Use the cars running people over in the streets as a

1668
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Physical example

1669
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,344
Left-wing a

1670
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,648
Activist in control of all the justice

1671
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:54,048
10000 people can be surrounding your vehicle threatening to kill you smashing the windows and everything and if you

1672
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:59,168
If you plow through it you are the bad guy

1673
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,496
Now all over the place

1674
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,568
Now they're being charged everywhere

1675
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:11,968
That's a very interesting way for Owen to dehumanize is opposition and take

1676
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,528
Hey what their positions are

1677
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
Enemies

1678
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
Political goals are point

1679
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,624
They're merely Ops

1680
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:22,464
Two sides that exist in this narrative or Alex and his

1681
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
Who are supposed

1682
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,560
Who are the bad guys

1683
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,936
Agree with Alex like let's say someone who might demonstrate for Reproductive Rights

1684
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,752
Protests against Real position

1685
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
Conviction

1686
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,104
Zombies have been brainwashed by the globalist

1687
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
And they're not the enemy

1688
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,664
They're just obstacles

1689
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
To be run over

1690
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,456
All they are is

1691
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
In the way

1692
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Yep

1693
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,040
Beautiful Warrior

1694
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,856
Are the only people who act

1695
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,648
Actually are on a path that involves making

1696
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,184
Choices are having agency

1697
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,232
Which naturally leads to some pretty sickening

1698
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
In conclusion

1699
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,560
This is the same mentality

1700
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,400
Expresses all the time when you talked about how killing the globalist is like killing a bug

1701
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
You don't want to do it

1702
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Do you have to

1703
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:09,056
That kind of rhetoric and the sort of thing that Owen is expressing here Army and Zara

1704
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,896
Tacit permission to enact violence on your political enemies by reducing them

1705
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
To being

1706
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
Human Lobster

1707
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
Recently USA Today reported

1708
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,112
May 27th event at least 66 instances of protesters being hit by car

1709
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
Undoubted

1710
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:27,488
Not all of these were cold-blooded attempted murders but at least some of them

1711
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
That we were

1712
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,328
Seven of the incidents were police hitting protesters

1713
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
In just over a month

1714
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
At least two of these people have been killed

1715
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,776
Countless others have been hurt and traumatized baby The Vamps

1716
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,080
This is not something that deserves to be mocked

1717
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,872
Even if you disagree with the politics

1718
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
People were being targeted by the

1719
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
These attacks

1720
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:49,760
I wholeheartedly despise Trump and his dumb rally

1721
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:55,648
But if there have been 66 instances of trump supporters being hit by cars at his rally since May 27th

1722
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:02,048
I would absolutely show some reverence to the subject with the opposition

1723
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,352
Trump the messaging of that movement

1724
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:09,472
Running civilians over with cars with an appropriate way to voice their political opposition

1725
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,848
And I can sit here and play the game where they pretend that these people are all just looters and rioters

1726
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:18,688
Threatening the people in the car who hit them in self-defense they know that's

1727
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,456
Spell check

1728
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,016
On some level these dude know they're what they're doing

1729
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
Trying to help normalize

1730
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,368
The enacting of lethal violence against their political rival

1731
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
And that's why I'll talk about helicopter rides

1732
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,768
That's why you talked about how his listeners could be instruments of God's Avenger

1733
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:39,936
There's a concerted effort of dehumanization of political enemies and violence on the

1734
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,704
Michelle

1735
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,264
The two-level a Time consistently uncomfortable

1736
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,056
Yeah that was

1737
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,872
If shorter and I are drunk in a bar

1738
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,408
He says that that's when you take ask

1739
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,456
You know it's just like

1740
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Outlook

1741
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,528
No no

1742
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,064
No

1743
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,904
I'm out I'm out however I'll leave you leave I just

1744
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
This is

1745
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,696
This is f*****

1746
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,976
This is Tupac

1747
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,280
Let's just to f*** that the message

1748
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
Yikes

1749
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:12,448
So

1750
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:16,544
Video to release all the dirt they actually have on Hillary and like all this evidence

1751
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
But you chopped up babies and stuff

1752
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,736
Cool

1753
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,760
Galax

1754
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
I think you might have.

1755
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
Really think that the New York cops

1756
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,232
And a New York FBI that are good people but are actually going through the process

1757
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:42,656
It's time to just released it is time to release

1758
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Golden Rule

1759
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,616
Whether America can handle it or not

1760
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:54,944
There's only one way to find out what

1761
01:29:55,456 --> 01:30:01,088
There is a real change in his Dynamic bro-down without

1762
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:04,416
Yeah yeah

1763
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:08,768
It sounded look who knows could be a coffee mug

1764
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Possibly drunk

1765
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,328
At this point

1766
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,632
And that's only furthered

1767
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,216
My suspicions are only furthered by the fact that he does a

1768
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
Jeff Foxworthy

1769
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:22,080
No

1770
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
Democrat

1771
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
So

1772
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
Anyway

1773
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
You guys are gray

1774
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,344
Yeah have you heard of this have you heard of this you might be a redneck

1775
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,952
Have you heard of this overdone joke structure that has permeated all of

1776
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,768
Not just America

1777
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:47,168
I really think Alex listens to our show to cuz we did that you might be

1778
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,288
We think he's probably less now that's

1779
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
Maybe maybe not

1780
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,224
So Alex 7277 memorandum 727

1781
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:07,392
That was about the Cold War to avoid nuclear war that Alex believes

1782
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
About actually taking

1783
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
Well

1784
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,048
7 + 2 is 9

1785
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,352
9 + 14

1786
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,120
That

1787
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
666

1788
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:27,360
So Alex Alex talks about there's a little bit

1789
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:30,176
CIA website talked about that and pass

1790
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
When

1791
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
I can't even

1792
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
Explain this ahead of time

1793
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,064
But this was one of the more disturb

1794
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,648
Urban Clips I've heard just because

1795
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
The amount of stupid he has

1796
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,768
To be if he actually think

1797
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
This is

1798
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Out of control

1799
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,912
For one, do you have

1800
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,680
Well

1801
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,336
We have a un Force around the world

1802
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,176
A lot of people

1803
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
The government

1804
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
Quietly

1805
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
CIA website

1806
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:15,744
727

1807
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,328
Bob on Wikipedia bisect

1808
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,656
What are the CIA has got a flyer

1809
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
From Mom

1810
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
About FBI agent CIA operative

1811
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,176
A newsletter called On Target

1812
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
They were planning

1813
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Kill

1814
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,576
And they continue to go along with the plan so

1815
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,136
Government knows all about this

1816
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
Ongoing battle

1817
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:50,048
So we talked to John about memorandum 7277 at the Paso there's no need to rehash that

1818
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,656
We've also talked about this page on CIA. Gov

1819
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,704
And how it's not a CIA product

1820
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:01,312
Copy of a newsletter called On Target which was produced by the Minutemen

1821
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,360
This is intensely disturbing

1822
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,688
Bring to your Alexei that the operatives for the CIA and FBI

1823
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,992
Shooting on Target because that's not true

1824
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:14,112
It was the publication of a Byron aggressively anti-communist militia group

1825
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:20,256
The Minutemen were an organization out of my home state of Missouri founded by a real dick head named Robert Depew

1826
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,584
Yeah he also was the person who wrote the ontarget newsletter

1827
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:30,240
After gaining Financial stability vitamin

1828
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,264
World War paranoia

1829
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
He set up shop

1830
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,872
In Norborne Missouri and started putting out his newsletter

1831
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
I was hoping to find like-minded Patriots

1832
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:41,760
He gained a small following who trained paramilitary tactics

1833
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:48,160
You constantly exaggerated the size of his movement which was an outside

1834
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
Sent the relevant Center probably deserve

1835
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:57,120
When you're alone anti-communist Wako it's all good well for you to accuse everyone of being a communist and then say they deserve

1836
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,144
Be killed or whatever

1837
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,192
When you start to create an image of

1838
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:05,056
Sway over a large ball

1839
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,616
Are you going to attract law enforcement attention with that

1840
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,640
Got a bag

1841
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,200
Who was not a mastermind

1842
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,528
And that's the FBI was able to infiltrate his group and found that he had a bunch

1843
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,576
Considering various spots

1844
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,112
Reward was coming against

1845
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
Communist

1846
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:25,280
Hi mr. Depew I am jaunty Minutemen I was wondering

1847
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,352
Dammit

1848
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:33,216
He was convicted in 1967 of National Firearms Act violations

1849
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
Before being sent to jail

1850
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:38,080
After two years he was captured and sent to prison for four years

1851
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,896
According to the Columbia Daily Tribune

1852
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:47,296
According to multiple reports

1853
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,832
Because he believed they were traitors

1854
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:53,952
In 1991 he was arrested on child pronography charges that stem from an alleged

1855
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,232
Modeling shoot you had with

1856
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
Teenage girl

1857
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,536
But he was knocking

1858
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,584
Just to let you know you would have been

1859
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
68 at that point

1860
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
Not a photographer

1861
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,496
Another thing about Robert

1862
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
Making

1863
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
Can kill list

1864
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,944
This was part of the reason that that issue of On Target is part of the documents included in the CIA

1865
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:19,040
Because they had it on file as part of monitoring his activities

1866
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:23,136
Because he was making him

1867
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Communist

1868
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,208
News publishing their names and addresses

1869
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,792
The subtitle of this newsletter is quote

1870
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,840
Action will

1871
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,680
Particularly disturbing to me is it

1872
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:42,080
I think from the way Alex is talking it's the document was made by Good Guys in the government

1873
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:45,408
The Patriots

1874
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:49,248
That's really f***** up because that's not what this is at all

1875
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,296
If Alex do anything about the subject

1876
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,064
He talks about

1877
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
Super reason to know that

1878
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,416
Alex thinks

1879
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,440
Did this

1880
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:04,608
Basically dachshund kill list that was put out by an anti-communist militia leader in 1960

1881
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,216
It's the good guys in the government telling all these people about who the globalist are

1882
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,520
Well I mean the order 60

1883
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:15,616
Was the good guys in the government getting rid of all those globalism

1884
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
Jedi

1885
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,480
My mind

1886
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,040
Had a hard time processing that clip

1887
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,368
Alex saying that that is

1888
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,392
Because here's what I think

1889
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:33,792
What I think that Alex doesn't understand why that document would be on the cia's if it wasn't created

1890
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:42,752
Really I think that's a good point I think that's why Alex thinks it was DIA

1891
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:46,080
Part of a dossier that they put together cuz they were observing him

1892
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:50,688
Because he was a dangerous

1893
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,968
Too stupid to believe

1894
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,296
That's what I'm used to

1895
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,856
Esthetician Plus in Spain

1896
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:04,256
But that's beyond the other possibility that I run into when I think about this is that Alex knows

1897
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
Did he was

1898
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,072
A crazy militia leader

1899
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,472
Or trying to sugarcoat in a little bit

1900
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,544
Yeah cuz he's a secret good guy in the governor

1901
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
He's not though

1902
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,848
No no no

1903
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,408
Although you know what

1904
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:27,808
If either come around like 40-50 years later he's got Duck Dynasty on a meet you know you be invented the Dog Taylor whatever

1905
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:31,392
The veterinary Arts

1906
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
Cuz

1907
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
Give a reality TV show

1908
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:36,000
This gif

1909
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
Messi

1910
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,864
Alex has

1911
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:47,264
From Europe Wars he's visiting Studio clip

1912
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,312
Dan is there a war on Western Civilization

1913
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,080
No

1914
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:54,176
There's no Limon in Amber

1915
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
Supposedly

1916
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
Osibih talkin about

1917
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,576
Is going to be a lot of migrants

1918
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:06,720
When you're up and you're the anti-immigrant what you know

1919
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
This

1920
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,536
Very much

1921
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,608
Into the ADI

1922
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
It's weird

1923
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:19,520
There is a prion around

1924
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,824
Supposed to just be about

1925
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,456
Be a lot of migrants coming into countries

1926
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,528
It's what you expect from these artists

1927
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,856
It's almost entirely

1928
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,928
Complaining about the ATL

1929
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,464
Alex

1930
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
How to set this up

1931
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,560
ATL rapper

1932
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,096
Goodyear

1933
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,152
ATL

1934
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,968
Because they make money off that

1935
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,016
Oh boy

1936
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,296
Oh boy

1937
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:05,600
That's interesting

1938
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,880
Refuses

1939
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
I don't know

1940
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:12,512
Because they start talking

1941
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:15,072
And I immediately start to understand

1942
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:15,840
Why

1943
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,912
This is happening in the middle of their conversation

1944
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
About

1945
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,984
Migrant cuz Nazis won World War II

1946
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,568
What continuum

1947
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
Macron

1948
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,200
200 million

1949
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,296
After 30 years of migration

1950
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,576
This is

1951
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
The

1952
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,368
Connective tissue

1953
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,696
The belief of the anti-Semitic

1954
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:48,096
Conspiracy theory about the kalergi plan is about reach cabal of Jews

1955
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,912
White man and white people

1956
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,240
Non-white people from foreign countries

1957
01:39:54,752 --> 01:40:00,896
That is the immigration angle that's being discussed here and that's why there is so much anger

1958
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,944
Remix

1959
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
Because

1960
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,016
Their view of immigration

1961
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
Dometic

1962
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,320
Conspiracy theory

1963
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,136
To basically this kalergi

1964
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:13,184
Plant stuff

1965
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
They got two up

1966
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
But they still don't want to lose you know the plan was still

1967
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,352
Kalergi plan is still a good propaganda tool

1968
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,960
Got updated

1969
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Call Jim

1970
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,592
That was a bad performance

1971
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:35,456
That's that's what's going on today that Rodger Clemens

1972
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
So we come back

1973
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
On Saturday

1974
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,344
Alex was drunk

1975
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
That night yeah I think

1976
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,672
He kept drinking probably

1977
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,816
Maybe that's why I wasn't able to do Friday night

1978
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:54,400
So we get to Saturday and

1979
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,936

And the only reason

2001
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,904
Didn't get a full partner

2002
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,464

Can't growl

2030
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:52,160
Ben Rogers longtime personal lawyer Tyler Nixon

2031
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,488
Not been a lawyer on the case was able to speak about it

2032
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,536
Because he's been outside

2033
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,584
He's scheduled to be joining us via Skype

2034
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,376
That's coming up

2035
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,680
Rodger is not on

2036
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,472
We have

2037
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
You Alex

2038
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:12,640
Got local news level accent the neighbor of the best friend of Rodger Stone

2039
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,408
Over here.

2040
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,688
Give us some information

2041
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,760
Yeah that's why I was like

2042
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
What the f***

2043
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,600
The bare minimum

2044
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,416
Is Rodger computer Hall

2045
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,744
Yeah. You didn't get it you didn't get it

2046
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,816
That's the end but there's bigger plan

2047
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,352
Saturday broadcast

2048
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:34,656
And then after he leaves us

2049
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,424
Never

2050
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
Add my phone's or my email

2051
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
Blown off

2052
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,520
Said walleye

2053
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,288
Like this

2054
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,336
Neighbor coming over my house this morning

2055
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,664
Wayfair Wayfair Wayfair Wayfair Wayfair

2056
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,712
I got home last night

2057
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,016
Pepper working like 6

2058
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,112
Rawley's text messages and I saw, 24th Wayfair Wayfair

2059
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:58,720
Is it true that Wayfair this online shopping system

2060
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,584
Was putting out ads for selling children's in armoires

2061
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,240
Why is this emergency

2062
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
Rodger got clemency

2063
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
All right so so far

2064
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
You have told me

2065
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,384
There is no Rodger

2066
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,432
And Alex is talking about Wayfair

2067
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:26,112
I'm not surprised I want to be more surprised I'm disappointed of course

2068
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:32,512
I'm very disappointed

2069
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:36,352
You want me to just have Rodger cousin

2070
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:42,496
I just love I can't begin to stress how much I love it whenever walks on Twitter or something or like

2071
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:47,104
Oh I can't wait to see what Alex has to this because it might had all I see all I hear is

2072
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,200
Just like you're looking forward to being disappointed I guess I have no idea

2073
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:57,600
Going to happen exactly why you can't do an emergency episode you got to wait and see how it's going to be

2074
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:02,976
Emergency mysteriously doesn't include best friend

2075
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,256
Weird

2076
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,072
Wow

2077
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:11,680
But I was thinking you know Rogers not ready to come on the show till tomorrow on the Sunday broadcast

2078
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,472
He's promised me one of the first interviews

2079
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,312
Stopped late last night drinking with Mancow Muller other one of my

2080
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,848
Longtime friends and I thought

2081
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,616
Wait a minute

2082
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:22,176
Mancow is still in Florida if he's up

2083
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,480
I'll call him and get him on the show so

2084
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,040
His wife are literally checking out with their children

2085
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,344
Out of the hotel room right now

2086
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,624
Check out

2087
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,392
We got a quick

2088
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,416
Popping from him

2089
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:38,816
His argument is basically stone is too hungover to go on the

2090
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:45,472
I mean that's most generous version

2091
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
Say that Rodger doesn't

2092
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
Answering his call

2093
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,848
So it might just be he's too busy with people who

2094
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,872
Matter

2095
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
So Mancow comes in

2096
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
Adorable

2097
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,736
Cab

2098
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,552
I am not a fan of Mancow

2099
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
My old friend

2100
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:05,952
Yes it should be I famously wasn't Gaston

2101
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:12,352
Many years back I was doing stand-up it was an accident I don't know why I was there

2102
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Read my life

2103
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,400
He did it on purpose

2104
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,936
I think is a little man

2105
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,728
Need to be off to work with

2106
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,544
I will say it a radio setting

2107
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:26,688
I generally don't care much for his appearances but this one is kind of funny a little bit because

2108
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,016
Mancow knows the social dynamic

2109
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:36,416
He just left hanging out with Rodger and Alex is doing the special broadcast about Rodger

2110
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,768
The status imbalance

2111
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
Gastronomic

2112
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
Mancow is

2113
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,400
Alex

2114
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:52,800
Is nothing in the pathetic world that they all live in Opportunity you got to feel good

2115
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,384
You f*** with our two little bit

2116
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,176
I want to tell you first of all Alec

2117
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,968
And you're not going to like this

2118
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,272
Everybody I talk to

2119
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:03,808
Your neck

2120
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,952
Your next man they take this government does not like

2121
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,232
You talkin

2122
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,280
I'm not talking about Trump

2123
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,376
I'm talking about the Deep State boy do they hate Alex Jones

2124
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,680
And I

2125
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,216
I'll tell you I'll be there with you

2126
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,800
The Patriots got to set up this bother you what I'm saying Alex

2127
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Are you already know it

2128
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:29,664
Oh I know it my friend I know it what are you hearing I don't wanna make this about me but what are you hearing

2129
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,712
No you're I just

2130
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:35,296
Anyone that's a patriot anyone that believes in God

2131
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,624
Anyone that believes in the Constitutional silly things like this

2132
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,160
They're going to get you

2133
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,208
How's Aaron heard anything goes.

2134
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,888
That's pretty solid f****** with Alex you know he's going to believe you when you say that s*** so you might as well draw it out

2135
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:52,448
The Dead Silence from Alex is like

2136
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,496
Do you know something I don't know

2137
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
And Mancow

2138
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,336
Edgerly knowing

2139
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:04,736
Has to wear that silent eating I don't think

2140
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:12,928
Cannot stop taking like every opportunity to be like I'm in the middle of this

2141
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,720
Rodger

2142
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,816
Last night Alex again everybody was calling in there

2143
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:25,216
And we're talkin political Talking Heads and famous people to call you and not you Alex

2144
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,520
For dinner I just I just wanted to hang out with the kids

2145
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,336
I was monopolizing your time but

2146
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,944
You know when somebody's a consummate

2147
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,504
Ninety-nine percent of the time

2148
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,600
On another consummate dick

2149
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:49,024
Yeah it's fantastic Behavior become humorous when you don't care about the recipient.

2150
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,048
So

2151
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,584
Got some sources

2152
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,864
Within the Old Government

2153
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
Right

2154
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,728
Boone County

2155
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,776
Trump is beginning

2156
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,800
Crack under pressure

2157
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,080
Right

2158
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,360
Alex cannot

2159
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,896
Allowed

2160
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:08,224
No but also is very high status

2161
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,064
Finally got into him at my god there they just don't stop there

2162
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,136
They're going after his little kids are going out today just God

2163
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:15,904
Stop

2164
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:19,488
And it finally got into him according to three really good sources

2165
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
And one

2166
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,840
Major major thorstad.

2167
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:29,216
He's losing it man, that's what I started this special transmission with

2168
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,800
Today is that there's a stack of news articles watched

2169
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,104
Compose counsel formulations all I'm saying

2170
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,664
We're preparing the military to remove him under

2171
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,200
The 25th Amendment

2172
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,504
And so they're putting those talking points out

2173
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
Scratching

2174
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
A lot of that is high

2175
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:46,368
People around you are wrong

2176
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:52,000
But regardless this is what Trump says so they get through me they're going to get you there not for me there after

2177
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:54,304
Are you got to support the president

2178
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,120
I think I'm going to get on a plane and go to DC and

2179
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:00,704
Florida and bullhorn the president's compound again

2180
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,032
About shining object

2181
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,104
Usable America pay for we got to let him know we back them right now

2182
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,408
I was at Mar-A-Lago yesterday

2183
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:24,256
Cannot resist what up again just like

2184
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,144
Mancow

2185
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,960
What a prick unbelievable

2186
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,496
Assholes

2187
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:38,336
So a Man cast joking around

2188
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,896
Apparently Rodger Stone may have said

2189
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:47,040
Mancow with q or something

2190
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:51,904
Time this is really fun because Alex has no idea what I was talking about

2191
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,440
This is very

2192
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,000
Did you see that Rodger Stone

2193
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:58,048
Revealed hughleys

2194
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Yes

2195
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Tell folks

2196
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,168
He said it was me

2197
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,032
So the next time I

2198
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
I'm not Q

2199
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:13,408
But the next time I come on you and I have some serious stuff to talk about

2200
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,944
I love you brother

2201
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:19,808
Well Rodger Stone the last week you are cute

2202
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,344
Started the whole thing

2203
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,392
That was very weird

2204
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,696
Need the weird part

2205
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,000
Comedy

2206
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,840
Rodger said

2207
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,144
Do you know this and now it says yes

2208
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:39,520
When it's clearly has no idea what the f***

2209
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:44,896
Might be a little bit of a cute guy

2210
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,944
Seems like all about the secret messages

2211
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,992
Yes look it up

2212
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,552
Did you hear about Wayfair and all the kid

2213
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:56,928
Do you know about all the pedophiles that this President is busting up but they keep try to tie him

2214
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,232
He's a present

2215
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,048
Want more comics

2216
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,072
Stay strong Alex

2217
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:07,680
So I think that's a bit secret codes are pushing I think

2218
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,960
I think you might be a cute guy

2219
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
Exactly

2220
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:17,152
Directly in opposition

2221
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,688
To what Alex believe

2222
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,248
We know that Alex has had private

2223
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,296
Personal conversations with Joe Rogan

2224
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,576
About hound once he gets

2225
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,880
Free and gets on Spotify he'll be away for

2226
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:29,696
From YouTube and I'll be able to attack the last absolute

2227
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,000
Granted Joe Rogan

2228
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:35,328
Has come out and said that that's a complete nonsense

2229
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:42,240
Erich Mancow Muller has a little bit of a different take on this and

2230
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:45,568
You realize you and I talked about this you realize I mean

2231
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,384
We know somebody who just got a big

2232
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,688
Todd Castillo by selling out

2233
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,736
You and I won't sell out

2234
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:58,368
And it's cost us millions in both don't understand that the Alex yelled at manpal

2235
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
Yeah man

2236
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
If we wanted to be asking

2237
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,976
We wanted to be owned

2238
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,048
God that we be rich

2239
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,400
But I don't care I we may just save this great

2240
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:16,288
Well my friend that's what it's all about it I'm you were smart to take your vacation. I already had it planned

2241
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,592
So smart

2242
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,360
To be able

2243
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,200
Hang out with Rodger I guess he's under house arrest

2244
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,504
Joe Rogan is apparently

2245
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,528
The Mancow

2246
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:30,368
Not a sellout

2247
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,160
Sure

2248
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,184
I mean

2249
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:39,072
I will say that the time that I was a guest on his show I felt like he was really straight up

2250
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,400
Very authentic

2251
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,936
Very much

2252
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:55,968
Nixon on this project Rodger

2253
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,248
You don't even do it if you

2254
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:01,088
I would suggest you don't do it

2255
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,160
McClymonds

2256
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,512
He was like

2257
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,816
It seems to be a Hot Topic maybe we can drive

2258
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,888
Traffic sure I know but I mean it just makes you look

2259
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,912
Really weak

2260
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:21,312
Can sad you can still get eyes on this thing with Rogers design

2261
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,616
Something

2262
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,640
Kind of a star

2263
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:28,480
You get to talk about Wayfair maybe you could do some ads

2264
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,016
Make a little money

2265
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:33,600
Yeah I guess it's bad or stay at home on a Saturday night

2266
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,416
Anyway

2267
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,720
Because it turns out that some of the people

2268
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,536
Supply dump

2269
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,584
Yeah maybe

2270
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,888
Can I be able to supply him anymore

2271
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:52,800
Where's my favorite they were good sellers

2272
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,152
My God

2273
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
Kiss me I'm getting pissed now

2274
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,784
You know you already know what's going on with the cupboard stuff

2275
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
Outdoor family I get back

2276
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
45-0

2277
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
What's your

2278
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,512
Wayfair

2279
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,584
Which I know I'm right about it if he were to get pissed at me

2280
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,400
I just I don't care I'm sorry the truth

2281
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,704
So we know that he's going to tell the truth

2282
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,008
About this sad Wayfair situation

2283
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,288
Which is that it was

2284
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:31,712
See if it's going around on the internet there is that there are

2285
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,272
Some suspiciously high price

2286
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,040
Cabinets

2287
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,832
Names

2288
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,904
People there people named

2289
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,976
And so these

2290
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,536
Decided that they must have be selling children

2291
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,376
And

2292
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:53,216
Serious question

2293
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,008
They think that

2294
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:59,360
Because they believe that is a smart idea

2295
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
They think that because they're

2296
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,688
Confused about why the prices so high

2297
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,624
Second timer

2298
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,648
If you were

2299
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,952
One of these people selling let me know

2300
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,024
I think I think that a lot of people get their ideas

2301
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,888
I'm thinking poisoned by the concept of hiding in plain sight

2302
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,424
Into your head

2303
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,472
You start to think like

2304
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,752
Place to do because

2305
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:33,152
No one would buy a $12,000 thing so if you did obviously you would

2306
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,944
Person who knows

2307
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,248
To look for the child there

2308
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
Yeah it's

2309
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
It's a bit

2310
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,136
So I know the truth about it

2311
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,160
No

2312
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,720
Why do people want to know what's up

2313
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:51,072
And we are back on this Saturday afternoon emergency transmission

2314
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,864
Without Rodgers

2315
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,656
Had

2316
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:57,728
So many people reaching out to me Prince family neighbor

2317
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:59,264
Email text messages

2318
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:02,848
Comments on Infowars wanting to know about Wayfair

2319
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:08,480
And I know Army Commandos and CIA operatives FBI agents

2320
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,808
That have been contacting me and others who think this is real

2321
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,624
Because

2322
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,160
They should be fighting

2323
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,464
Credibly obviously weird

2324
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,512
What year did

2325
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,816
It's it's very weird

2326
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:27,168
Threshold of proof for a lot of people that Alex

2327
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:27,936
I thought you mean

2328
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:31,520
So Alex began you already said that he knows the truth about test

2329
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:35,360
We've revealed it which is what he knows the truth that's important

2330
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,176
Because he now says he doesn't know what's up

2331
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,480
Now that said I'm not sure

2332
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,760
Exactly what's going on

2333
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,832
But I have a pretty good idea this is one of three things

2334
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,112
What is three possible

2335
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,648
But you can't

2336
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,440
So he knows the truth he knows

2337
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,464
He doesn't know what's up

2338
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,744
But it's one of these three things

2339
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,024
Why don't you

2340
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
I used to like

2341
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,608
Here are the three possibilities

2342
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,912
Either it's a money-laundering operation

2343
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,936
And so they had the

2344
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,776
Numbers and what would be in the cabinet would be drugs or something

2345
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:07,360
Or you're paying more for something because you're using drug money to pay for

2346
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,152
That goes on all over the place

2347
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
Online it

2348
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,248
Okay

2349
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,832
Were you got $100 cabinet at $200 cabinet actually bought

2350
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,184
That you had a couple zeros to or whatever and now it is

2351
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
12000

2352
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,488
13040

2353
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:24,256
Thousand

2354
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:30,400
Dollars is Alex implying that he's laundering money launder money

2355
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:34,240
Are you surprised that better

2356
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,776
First option

2357
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
Sure there's a second

2358
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,592
So it's either money laundering

2359
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:45,504
Or is the big mistake they shed and some fool added 02 it

2360
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,272
That's not what they said

2361
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:49,600
That's the second option so maybe 80

2362
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,368
Catsup

2363
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,672
Massive conspiracy to launder money

2364
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,208
Could be a good day

2365
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,232
Option 3

2366
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
Or

2367
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,816
Is it really

2368
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
That there

2369
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,912
Advertising mesh as a

2370
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
Package a container

2371
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,496
Symbolizing their deliver you a child

2372
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,312
Drugged up in one of these jobs

2373
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,736
Diesel three option

2374
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,040
What do you think he's going to go with

2375
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,600
Money laundering

2376
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,880
Selling Kids Academy

2377
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:26,208
He's going to say this is a big one and we caught him

2378
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:30,560
That's interesting

2379
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:32,864
There's a fork

2380
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:35,680
God dammit I can't sit there was a fourth

2381
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Okay

2382
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,032
Alright

2383
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,568
Think about that

2384
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
No

2385
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:45,920
I refused. The four

2386
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
Yeah you hell

2387
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:51,296
I believe this is the fourth from all the evidence and

2388
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,344
Rageous it is obvious it is

2389
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,136
Sure how it's designed

2390
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,160
And mint

2391
01:59:56,928 --> 02:00:00,256
Can you put a big old juicy Nightcrawler worm on the end of a hook

2392
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,280
And drop it in there

2393
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,328
The bass of the parts of the crop

2394
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
Cosplay

2395
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,960
Smells good as we're going around they're going to want to talk about it

2396
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:14,080
Yeah so the fourth option is at the track

2397
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,872
In order for the oak

2398
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,408
Conspiracy theorist or whatever

2399
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,712
To find an amplifier as a trap

2400
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,528
In order to invalidate other stories

2401
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,064
About crimes against children

2402
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,392
I mean whatever this is Ludacris

2403
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:31,232
Feel like I feel really frustrated

2404
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,768
With that thought price

2405
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:35,328
Yeah cuz if you think

2406
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
But that's

2407
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,376
What it is

2408
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,144
Okay

2409
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,680
Here's what the globalist mean

2410
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,448
To trap you

2411
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:41,984
Nothing

2412
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,800
You're saying

2413
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:47,360
To all of your conspiracy Latin friend

2414
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:50,432
That the globalist don't even need to work

2415
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:53,248
Hard to get you guys to believe stupid

2416
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:59,904
Well I mean it was the same rationalization for the stuff about the Obama's birth certificate

2417
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,696
Forget the birtherism

2418
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,256
Put out the Kenyan births

2419
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:07,072
Certificate was racist

2420
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,656
Saved saved

2421
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:14,752
He was the child of the Apes

2422
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,544
Didn't your old

2423
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:22,176
So f****** stupid that you're willing to make your balls over anything

2424
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,224
All right

2425
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,504
I guess you got

2426
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,088
Alright Alex believe there's this fourth option that is

2427
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
I think that he's not

2428
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:39,328
Considering a fifth option is that the people who make up the large bulk of his audience

2429
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:45,984
Not very good at Discerning information

2430
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:49,312
They're going to pizzagate all over again

2431
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,848
When you look at

2432
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,896
It's not just that they are

2433
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,176
0 Steel

2434
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:58,272
Money laundering it looks like because it's the names of girls

2435
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,880
And it's not like that it's all these products

2436
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,928
Named after little girls

2437
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,000
And a bunch of them are really weird names

2438
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:10,816
Steven know what you get when you buy a boat children

2439
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
On the backs of milk carton

2440
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,632
Internet

2441
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:19,776
Now why in the hell would they put out ads

2442
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:22,336
Can really deliver you children and cabinets and

2443
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,360
Then put

2444
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,408
The actual names of kids

2445
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,992
This is one thing and one thing only

2446
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,016
I

2447
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:35,392
Conditionally admire Alexei that

2448
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:40,512
Why would they do this at least even Alex can be like this is stupid

2449
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,816
Unacceptable

2450
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:48,704
Unacceptable to me the moment the moment you add in the fact that you can be yourself

2451
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,496
This would be a dumb thing for Sorento

2452
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:56,896
To do it's all about it honestly the only because I was got embarrassed so badly with pizzagate probably only

2453
02:02:57,152 --> 02:03:02,272
Reason why he's behaving like that if that happens can learn that's really bumper to

2454
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,808
That's just because it was Danger

2455
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,416
Did this stuff again

2456
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,440
Like

2457
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:15,328
That's too traceable to be on the right side of this in case it does break that directly

2458
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:19,424
He knows that and that's why this whole conversation

2459
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,240
Hey remember what happened with pizzagate and then him trying to

2460
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,032
Pretend he didn't die

2461
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,056
Remember

2462
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,848
All of this it was

2463
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:31,456
Top story on drudge top story all over the place

2464
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,992
Now

2465
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,552
This broke for about a week or two

2466
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,368
And then suddenly out of the podesta

2467
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,392
And out of

2468
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,160
Lebanon

2469
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,184
Democratic Party

2470
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:46,304
CNN the New York Times Washington Post

2471
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:49,632
Trout said wow bizarre claims

2472
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:52,448
That a pizza place has a dungeon under it

2473
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,008
And they're killing kids and selling them

2474
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:57,824
I mean that all these things out that look better feel it

2475
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:02,944
Wendy's other businesses they do as well and it turned out some of the stuff was really creepy and weird

2476
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:09,344
We had Jack this

2477
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,632
Easy myself to check this out has recordings of those things

2478
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,472
Now to try to delete them for the internet but they're

2479
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,240
Still there

2480
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,032
So I mean

2481
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:31,104
Obviously the argument that he's trying to make

2482
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:31,872
Is

2483
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:37,248
That the podesta emails Wikileaks things came out later real code about

2484
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,016
Trafficking

2485
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,392
The the whole thing pizzagate ended up

2486
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:46,208
Just being a distraction from Shield

2487
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:50,816
Elaine Maxwell

2488
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,352
Is been arrested

2489
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:55,424
This is in order to cover up

2490
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,984
As opposed to possibly just

2491
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,520
Mass

2492
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,080
Delusion

2493
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,664
People who feed into each other's internet behaviors

2494
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,712
They go on these vicarious

2495
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:10,784
Hunt's where they think that they're doing something and blue

2496
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,576
Exactly

2497
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:17,696
I think that's a much easier explanation cuz that's exactly what happened

2498
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,488
Pizzagate happened in real time

2499
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:22,048
Like ready Fords

2500
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,072
Where are they

2501
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,608
Conspiracy board where people were

2502
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,144
Like coming up with new

2503
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,680
Uses of information and then

2504
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,448
Some of it

2505
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,496
Gets rejected some of it

2506
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:34,080
Floor boar and then like a couple days later than November

2507
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:40,736
Days ago someone said this week and then they'll bring it back in like I watch that happen in real time

2508
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,504
This is

2509
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,600
Watch quicker

2510
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,880
Broke

2511
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,672
Like that

2512
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
For it now

2513
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,232
Call got the

2514
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,000
The Playbook

2515
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,120
Such low standards

2516
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,168
For bringing things to the Public's attention

2517
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:02,752
Amplify

2518
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:06,080
Effectively that you can go from nothing to

2519
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:08,384
Oh God so fast

2520
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,408
So fast

2521
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,944
Yep

2522
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:15,296
On the show

2523
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:21,696
You to believe that he did nothing

2524
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,976
So smart

2525
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:26,816
And so it is next Globe he throws his staff under the bus

2526
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,376
That's what you get

2527
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:34,496
You're not getting the Skype calls right to our pizza gate

2528
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:35,776
And then

2529
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,056
He's a legend

2530
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
With no proof

2531
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:45,248
CNN people were the ones who were posting this stuff on Fortune wow

2532
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,040
I'm sitting there

2533
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:50,624
I'm going on vacation for a week Cancun

2534
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,720
Stop covering it I smell a rat they're diverting us to this off of that

2535
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:56,768
I'm at the crib

2536
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,352
And that's then how the media goddess and said that we created

2537
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:01,376
A fake story

2538
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:03,424
And they use that not being accurate

2539
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,240
Either we didn't create it

2540
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,032
CNN MSNBC they

2541
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,848
No doubt their operative put on 4chan

2542
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,616
Hm

2543
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,920
That this information is there

2544
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,736
Then we cover it

2545
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:22,880
Then they flip it when we broke the big Spirit cooking or the first to get it out and Drug post it

2546
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:26,464
You're proud and they turn with Alchemy

2547
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:31,072
The real kids in the real farm houses in the real $65,000 a hot dog

2548
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:33,120
And the blood in the semen in the breast milk

2549
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,400
Aleister Crowley

2550
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,680
And the devil worshipping

2551
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:40,800
All these photos and videos of little kids all scared women dressed like witches and big bats

2552
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,568
The blood

2553
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:45,408
Maria bolanovich in in her and Reddit posts

2554
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,944
I do rituals for real

2555
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:51,296
All of that got distracted by the media than focusing in

2556
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,088
On

2557
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:56,160
There was no basement the pizza place

2558
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
Right

2559
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,696
But you did that

2560
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:58,976
You weren't thinking

2561
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:01,536
Cancun

2562
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:09,216
But because of how embarrassing that was

2563
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,008
And how much

2564
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,056
I guess Alex took a hit on it

2565
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,360
And probably felt exposed yeah he must have

2566
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,896
You must have gotten more

2567
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:22,784
Something then will I mean it's one of those times that he had to give a big public apology to drink

2568
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:26,624
It sounds like there's a decent chance that he just thought like

2569
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,904
Buck

2570
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:28,672
To close

2571
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:29,952
To close on this one

2572
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,536
But

2573
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:35,072
You didn't learn it all the way

2574
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:41,216
It's not just you a Maxwell getting arrested

2575
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:45,312
Also all of these stories about out of Germany

2576
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:49,152
For some reference there two stories

2577
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,944
Out of Germany that Alex has been

2578
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,712
Been covering

2579
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,504
One of them have to

2580
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,784
To do with

2581
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,576
In the past

2582
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:58,880
There were a homeless children

2583
02:08:59,136 --> 02:08:59,904
Who were given to

2584
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,464
Foster parents who were known to be pedophiles

2585
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:08,608
And the studies of it in the recording on it is unclear

2586
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,168
The scope to which this was taking place

2587
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,192
Not appear to

2588
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,544
Spread

2589
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,848
Yeah

2590
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,176
And the other story is about

2591
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:26,528
A soldier who was arrested fairly recently last year

2592
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,064
Investigation

2593
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,368
Surrounding

2594
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:33,952
The uncovering of an online child pronography sharing Network

2595
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:37,536
Some crimes against children

2596
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:40,352
And there were 30,000 leave

2597
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:42,144
The police had to go on

2598
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,704
Stories

2599
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:45,984
And I believe

2600
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:50,080
His intention is to say that this Wayfair story

2601
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:53,664
Is trying to somehow block

2602
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,944
Text from the

2603
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,992
Write that story

2604
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,808
He's treated those two stories of kind of

2605
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:03,392
The same story even though they're not the same story at all

2606
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,184
It's really complicated but

2607
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,976
When he starts talking about the

2608
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:12,352
It's tough in this next clip really kind of brought into Focus something I found really disturbing

2609
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,632
About Alex's popat

2610
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
German

2611
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:20,288
Psychiatrist German government gave children the pedophile

2612
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:24,128
1001 town

2613
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:26,176
It turned out it was a spider web all over the country

2614
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,712
They limited that as well

2615
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:29,760
Dw.com

2616
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,368
Show again ladies and gentlemen

2617
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,648
Put that back on screen please

2618
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,696
Understand

2619
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,720
What's going on

2620
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:45,120
The week that broke I said watch next week it'll break that tens of thousands of children are involved

2621
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:48,704
1007 don't exactly as I said it broke

2622
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,472
Why

2623
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:52,032
British psychological warfare manual

2624
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,384
How did you so happen to be being sold at Barnes & Noble like 20 years ago

2625
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,456
Talked about their techniques after WWII Africa they said

2626
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:03,296
Corporations kill se5000 villagers

2627
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:06,112
We need to get out of head of it and say they kill 20

2628
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,392
Perfect story

2629
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,072
Because the pit psychiatrist over CPS

2630
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,864
In Berlin what's ending

2631
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,912
Thousands of children a pedophile

2632
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,216
They first reported on his case

2633
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:23,264
And not how was much larger

2634
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,288
Titrating pitocin

2635
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,336
Preparing you for was about to come out

2636
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,456
That's what this is

2637
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:35,552
I can still find no evidence to support the claim that Alex is making In that clip

2638
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,088
Exaggerating the reporting

2639
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,904
System

2640
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,440
In West Berlin

2641
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,208
Homeless children

2642
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
Pedophiles

2643
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:49,888
Again to stress that point any number of children is unacceptable I'm only pointing out the

2644
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,912
Making up information

2645
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,704
To help his narrative be more

2646
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,472
Sensational

2647
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:58,080
Like I said what's going on here is he's combining two unrelated stories out of Germany

2648
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:03,712
The first is about those homeless youth being placed in foster care without a files

2649
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:07,040
And the second story is about the 30,000

2650
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:09,856
Send the weeds at the police have with the modern-day Network

2651
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:12,928
So

2652
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,744
Minimize this kind of thing

2653
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,512
At all

2654
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,816
Equally wrong to sensation

2655
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:21,888
Prior Story the one about the

2656
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:23,936
For care system is the one that

2657
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:24,704
To talk about

2658
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,520
And the Second Story includes the number 30,000

2659
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
Metallica

2660
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:31,872
Amplify so Alex is just combined them into being about the

2661
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,408
Same thing when they're not

2662
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:38,272
That being said the real reason that I pulled this clip is because how clearly demonstrates

2663
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:40,320
Patterns

2664
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,880
He believes that everything is psych ward

2665
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:49,280
So he's gotten himself into a very bizarre

2666
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:54,144
Because he's rationalized that the thing that he's lying about his just like Warfare to begin with

2667
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:56,448
Let's take this specific example

2668
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:59,264
Alex is lying about reporting about

2669
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,032
German Faust

2670
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:02,336
Your story but he doesn't see it as lying

2671
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:04,384
Because he believes that the original reporting

2672
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:08,992
Is just the globalist getting ahead of the story in order to soften the blow when the real story

2673
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:09,760
Free comes out

2674
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:12,832
Another story justifying his embellishment

2675
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,856
That's not come out

2676
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:16,672
But an unrelated topic has

2677
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:19,488
So he just that good enough he's claimed to Victory

2678
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,512
About everything

2679
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:23,584
This kind of thought patterns

2680
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:28,704
You can't stay

2681
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:33,056
Victory

2682
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:38,432
That's because he thinks reality is being reported in just psych Warfare

2683
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,296
Compensating for that

2684
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:45,088
To make the story match up with

2685
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,112
Actual reality

2686
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,696
In fact what he's doing is making things up in life

2687
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:50,976
Experience at that way

2688
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:55,328
Is that last clip at all accurately expresses Alex's beliefs

2689
02:13:55,584 --> 02:14:00,704
Be fair to say that his version of Truth could be described as lying about things you think our lives

2690
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:04,032
Really eye-opening

2691
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
Yeah

2692
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,848
Yeah because

2693
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,664
Just just making it up

2694
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,688
Red light cuz

2695
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:17,088
So what are you saying is that the Wayfair situation

2696
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:17,856
Shane is a hoax

2697
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:19,392
Distract from the

2698
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:21,184
Two situations that

2699
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,720
He has conflated engine

2700
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,024
That will distract

2701
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:25,792
From the app

2702
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,096
Individual circumstances

2703
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:32,448
That both stories are not dealing with whatsoever and Elena Maxwell

2704
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,728
And Elaine Maxwell

2705
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,776
Yet all of this is fine

2706
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:38,080
Because sometimes the globalist

2707
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:38,848
Starline

2708
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:43,200
Do you and sometimes they're not because of course I can quote New York Times

2709
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:46,272
And all of those things whenever they

2710
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,320
If it don't

2711
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:53,440
Everything that disagrees with what I believe

2712
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:54,720
Is

2713
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:55,744
Lies

2714
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,144
To me and everyone out when it when it's convenient this story is like Warfare so I can lie to adjust

2715
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:08,544
Us to compensate for whatever I believe this

2716
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:11,360
As opposed to what it actually is

2717
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:12,384
And why

2718
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,224
So I think that's interesting and

2719
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:16,992
Kind of

2720
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:20,064
I do I don't want to say gives me closure

2721
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,904
Finally gives me a better understanding of why you such a liar

2722
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:28,000
Binky such a liar

2723
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:34,400
If you do believe what he's saying they're like if he actually believes that about what he does

2724
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:36,448
Information works yeah

2725
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,240
You could justify

2726
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,104
Sure and then this is the truth

2727
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,152
That story is the whitewash

2728
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:49,248
That's the fake version of the story

2729
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:52,320
Feels right

2730
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,624
A large

2731
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,648
His behavior

2732
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:57,696
End

2733
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:58,976
And the thing about the

2734
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,768
Is not too

2735
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:03,584
Experience any empathy

2736
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:05,120
In this way but

2737
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,144
What that is

2738
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,168
Essentially saying

2739
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:10,240
I will never accept

2740
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:11,776
Good news

2741
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,568
Because it doesn't

2742
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,872
Conform to my version of real

2743
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:17,664
Do you know what I mean

2744
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,944
Like everything that

2745
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,736
Provides good

2746
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,528
And enjoy you

2747
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:24,576
Lies about 8 in order to

2748
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:26,624
Facilitate the continuation of this

2749
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,648
Globalist

2750
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:30,720
And he amplifies every negative news source

2751
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,792
As long as it helps with is conspiracy

2752
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,328
Any real news

2753
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,632
Is negative because it helps with his

2754
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:38,400
Conspiracy theory

2755
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,960
And so at any and all time

2756
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:44,032
He is experiencing nothing but panic

2757
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,056
Fear and rage

2758
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,616
If he actually is

2759
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:51,456
Yummy Nummies

2760
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,736
Torturing himself

2761
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:56,320
Right

2762
02:16:56,576 --> 02:17:01,952
I'm just trying to people around him

2763
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,144
Is far more to the people listen to like how can you listen to this guy

2764
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,192
Guy and take it seriously when he's

2765
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,472
Clearly

2766
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:14,752
Expressing to you

2767
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:18,080
Yeah I renew stories that I just make up stuff because

2768
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:18,848
It's like Warfare

2769
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:21,408
Achilles

2770
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:24,480
It's really it's really sad

2771
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:30,880
Unknowingly essentially been

2772
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:32,672
Tricked into a cult of Alex

2773
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:35,232
Yeah like it's just whatever he interprets

2774
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:36,768
Experiences as true

2775
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:38,304
Representatives

2776
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,376
And he will harangue you with

2777
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:43,936
References to like Arcane and abs

2778
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:48,544
Your documents you haven't read any hasn't either in order to justify his position

2779
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,592
Fucken parlor trick

2780
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:51,872
Ridiculous

2781
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:52,640
Very sad

2782
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:56,480
Who are the people's belief

2783
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,248
Yes

2784
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:01,344
It's ultimately because I mean like this Legacy doesn't hold up

2785
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,368
Like no

2786
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:04,416
Bank of us say we'd survive

2787
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:05,440
Current trouble

2788
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,024
His history doesn't go down well

2789
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,584
I'm the same way that we can look back on the job

2790
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,680
Society and all like right-thinking people to be like today

2791
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,984
Yeah

2792
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,544
He's going to be similarly

2793
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:21,568
Hugh

2794
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:25,152
What he has done with his life his life's work will look

2795
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,200
Yet

2796
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:28,480
But

2797
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,760
I don't think he cares

2798
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:31,040
Yeah I mean

2799
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,832
You know in the same way

2800
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:35,648
His listeners are victims in participating

2801
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,440
Participants in their own

2802
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,208
Kind of

2803
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:38,976
Miserable

2804
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,256
Since Alex is

2805
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:45,120
Visiting upon them and himself is unfortunate he's torturing everyone

2806
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:45,888
Yeah

2807
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
Proximity

2808
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:57,152
I told you that there was a conditional aspect to me saying that Alex was like

2809
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
Does Wayfair conspiracy

2810
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:00,480
Conditional

2811
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,528
Cuz he's about to say that maybe true

2812
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,088
The globalist to put out the system formation

2813
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:07,904
Because they know this is Master this is a zeitgeist

2814
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:13,024
Understand it and I hope when it comes out this isn't true it'll somehow discredit all

2815
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,584
We believe this will blow up in their face

2816
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,608
Quite pizzagate

2817
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,448
People will see through all this and understand what's going on

2818
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,472
Now

2819
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:23,264
But it'd be there really money laundering

2820
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,336
Could it be that there actually these are real lad who knows

2821
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,224
Khalilah Morris Heroes Reddit

2822
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,760
I don't believe so

2823
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,784
Because

2824
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,832
They're all named after little girls

2825
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,624
A bunch of a missing little girl

2826
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,160
Make everybody go crazy

2827
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:44,000
So he is saying it's globalist

2828
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:46,816
Disinformation but also maybe it's

2829
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,144
Where I know

2830
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,704
Yes it's globalist information

2831
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,008
Disinformation because maybe the other thing

2832
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,544
How could it be both

2833
02:19:57,056 --> 02:20:01,920
How can it even be possible that it's money laundering if it's an intentional plan by the globalist

2834
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:02,688
To make

2835
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,272
Your side look bad and make it look like

2836
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,320
Alright then

2837
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:09,856
It's like in chess

2838
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,904
When you're when you when you got a pin

2839
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:13,952
I don't know

2840
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:20,352
The German like Zeus or whatever whatever

2841
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,400
You get to take one of their peace

2842
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:23,424
No matter what

2843
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:28,032
Haha it's so sad this is why so few are laundering money

2844
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:28,800
You both

2845
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,336
Actually launder money

2846
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:33,664
And also make it look like you're not laundering money

2847
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:39,296
Unless somebody figures out that your laundry

2848
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:40,576
Just like

2849
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,368
Pizzagate blew up in their face

2850
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,648
Face is definitely no one else

2851
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:45,696
In space no.

2852
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,744
Yeah but I will

2853
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:54,144
There's no way I appreciate your attempt to stretch this to make sense

2854
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,168
Credulity

2855
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:56,192
No no

2856
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,984
Freestyle mixes

2857
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:01,824
Pretty clear that this is a stupid way to try and deliver

2858
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,360
Trafficked children

2859
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,384
You really think

2860
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,944
Group like this was shipped thousands of kids around engine

2861
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:08,480
Not knowing the trucks

2862
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,016
Record one's going to fall open

2863
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,808
Are kids going to die in one

2864
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:12,832
No papa

2865
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,392
Not true it's not real

2866
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,928
That's why

2867
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:19,232
They are doing all of this thing in May

2868
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:20,256
Typos

2869
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:23,072
100 hundreds of items were going over right now have more tomorrow

2870
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:24,352
This was done in May

2871
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,424
And they use names of real children are missing

2872
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:32,032
People take the bait

2873
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,568
And say oh my God this is

2874
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,104
So this is bae

2875
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:35,872
This is bait

2876
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:36,896
It's the globalist

2877
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:39,712
Mistress Honey Trap

2878
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:40,480
Now

2879
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,296
Make this next clip

2880
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,320
Tough to hear

2881
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,672
Because it is coming out they can't hide it

2882
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,720
The system doesn't know what to do

2883
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,768
So I've been set up like this

2884
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,096
Party Rental

2885
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,376
Georgia

2886
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:01,984
But this is meant to discredit the real work that police are engaged in in my view

2887
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:03,520
A nebulous trailers arthrotec

2888
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:04,544
Comments below

2889
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:10,176
But if the globalism not bold enough and maybe I'm wrong to ship kids actually in containers like this

2890
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:14,272
Psychos when they get don't get caught around it away with the automobile crazy

2891
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:16,320
Even crazier start wanting to get caught

2892
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:19,648
And who the hell knows anymore I having this is just unbelievable

2893
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:20,928
But know this

2894
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:23,488
This was not an accident

2895
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,280
They use a bunch of little girls names

2896
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,816
Come up missing girls

2897
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,608
Complete the first and last name

2898
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:30,912
This was done

2899
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,448
Bait you

2900
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:33,728
Away from all the other.

2901
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:37,056
Infowars.com newswars.com tomorrow's news today

2902
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:39,104
That's the end of his special report

2903
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,152
This is not how you do this

2904
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,456
This is not good

2905
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,992
Because he's clearly

2906
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:48,320
Clearly articulating his position that this is

2907
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:49,088
This is

2908
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:53,440
Sucker people into going down

2909
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:55,232
I've been right at the end

2910
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,256
He's like

2911
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,280
Maybe I don't know

2912
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,656
Do that

2913
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,936
If you know that the

2914
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,728
Ludacris

2915
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:08,800
Why are you making the bait possibly attractive to your audience

2916
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:12,384
I think it's cuz he

2917
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:19,040
I think I've decided honestly I am the only person that exists

2918
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,064
Who's here because he

2919
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:23,392
I know I know that insane I can

2920
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,416
Counter

2921
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,440
You're arguing

2922
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,232
I don't know

2923
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:28,768
You wouldn't believe me

2924
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:32,864
Yes but things happen when you're not here

2925
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,960
How can you even he's got an

2926
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:39,520
Ladies if you got an iPhone do you have a choice

2927
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,336
How can you how can you

2928
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,408
How can you turn this somehow into you being

2929
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:46,176
Victim

2930
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:51,552
Thought

2931
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:54,112
It is that a lot

2932
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,184
Red Bull

2933
02:23:57,696 --> 02:24:02,816
Add Wayfair time the victim were clearly targeted at

2934
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,352
Hoosier way

2935
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:08,192
These qanon folks who are posting all of these

2936
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,472
These Wayfair

2937
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:15,872
Conspiracy by the globalist Trap me Alex covering this

2938
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:19,968
In order to delegitimize my already Sterling

2939
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:23,296
Remarkable unimpeachable record

2940
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:27,392
Which I will then defeat them by revealing that it's a hoax

2941
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:30,208
Why won't you leave it the possibility open

2942
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:36,608
But hey they might be doing I don't want to fully close the door on this just in case I realized it could be

2943
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:37,376
Comfortable

2944
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:38,912
What the f***

2945
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,192
The thing about the Honey Trap

2946
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:41,728
Honey

2947
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,032
And I like honey

2948
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,848
Little bit of honey

2949
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:53,248
I don't know I always constantly and blessed with

2950
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,040
The feeling of like bewilderment

2951
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,088
Because like

2952
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:01,184
Supposed to be like Rodger

2953
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:05,280
I do recall this being the David

2954
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:07,840
It is a profound

2955
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:08,608
Statement

2956
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:10,144

That cannot be over

2960
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:21,152
The idea that Mancow was at the same Hotel

2961
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:23,712
Where Rodger Stone

2962
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:26,784

2963
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,416
The fact that all of that happened

2964
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:34,208
Is dammit

2965
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:37,536

I would love it if Alex had the backbone that it took

2975
