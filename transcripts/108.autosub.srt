Today's episode of covering the 30

41
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
Yes I want to tell you a little bit about what happened the other day on the

42
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
There was a

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
Amazing comedy

44
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Accidentally

45
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
Well that would be the only way it happens

46
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
It's for the entire beginning of

47
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Alright I got

48
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
We have some big news out of Disney

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,408
Which means he has nothing to say it's going to blow everything out of the water

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
I just do it

51
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
I don't get into the news I just thought

52
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:47,328
I just don't know how to do it I just don't know how to do this job it's so huge

53
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
These are demons

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
A 10-minute ramble through screaming about demons they know they're doing it

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
What are you

56
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Talking about

57
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,968
Steven Wright so you know what they're doing so at the end of the second hour or so

58
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
I would like for you to guess

59
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
What the big news out of business

60
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
That proves everything

61
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Coco

62
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
What

63
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
Delivered

64
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
Pretty good

65
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Overrated

66
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,359
Nobody knows this everyone knows

67
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,711
I've got two things I know

68
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
I didn't hate it

69
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
And start over

70
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Because I want that

71
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Star Wars in the clear

72
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Episode 8

73
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Are you shiting

74
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
That's not the last

75
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Come on

76
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
It's not that

77
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
It's not that so

78
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,175
What happened with Ridley's

79
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
I would argue with his first-half problem

80
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
His second first and third eye problems

81
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
Listen

82
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,615
You should never even had this

83
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Is Kevin the bird

84
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Okay we can all agree on the talk about this the other night

85
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Don't need to rehash this so the big man

86
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Yes is with Millie Weaver

87
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Roosevelt

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Out and about

89
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Trying to find a book

90
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Cuz he has drilled into

91
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Buying a children's book

92
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Right

93
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
There's no way the story goes anywhere satisfying for

94
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Define the book

95
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
Called feminist baby

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Alright

97
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
Alright okay

98
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
So Disney

99
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Is run by liberals even

100
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Because one time

101
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
They put out a book called feminist baby

102
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
Your babies are you sure it's not

103
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
I know but I don't know why Alex didn't think that was

104
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Somehow like

105
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
Trying to corrupt the children

106
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Whatever the Socialists

107
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Stance on

108
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Certainly

109
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
Children after run Fortune 500

110
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
Companies like socialist

111
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
First second and third acts problems

112
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
A real bad boy

113
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Better than Waldorf

114
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Educational tell you that much I don't know anything about Waldorf education

115
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
It's like unguided

116
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Like it's 88 celebrate

117
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
The like

118
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
Children get to learn however they want kind of as I understand

119
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
Like from The Simpsons episode Bart is accidentally classified as a

120
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Genius until he goes to the school

121
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,647
What I understand

122
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,999
According to the Simpsons

123
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
But I would under

124
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Stand it with that would make

125
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
I think so much

126
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Like

127
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,263
You could just call that the episode where Bart learns to speak French

128
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Fine fine

129
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
So Millie Weaver finds this book

130
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,247
And on one of these you give me The Simpsons reference that will explain the circuits

131
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
I don't know

132
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
So she finds this book

133
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
I wanted pages

134
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
It says this baby doesn't like pants

135
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
What is it what is that either way because I mean the reason the page is in there

136
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,847
Because babies often do take off their pants or diaper

137
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Pants

138
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Other page weather

139
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
Call Top

140
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Dresses

141
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,911
No no it's it's all about their clothes

142
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Perfect status display I've ever seen I thought it was like really really

143
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Play bad then

144
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
You threw it to

145
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Special Report

146
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,503
Where Millie Weaver is going over how she found it

147
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
Have you like I don't know how I can cover this

148
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
So I'm going to get some

149
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Some help from Rainbow snatch

150
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
So bad

151
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
So bad

152
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
She does the throat as Superman is what she did she jump into a telephone booth

153
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,031
Knowstyle

154
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Does Rainbow snatch in a wig

155
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Sitting around reading the book

156
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
It's it's it's atrocious

157
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Because the real story would be like

158
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
So

159
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
I can't breathe

160
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
A bookstore which first off

161
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
Where did those come from Sugar Ray

162
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Right

163
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Borders

164
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
No

165
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Is mascot a bookstore and I went into the

166
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
Section which I still don't think they should know how to read

167
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
That should be the tree of knowledge you want to give kids

168
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
But not on purpose

169
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
I meant race memory

170
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
And then I read it again

171
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
And then Alex called me and said

172
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
I've got nothing

173
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
Rainbow snacks

174
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Millie Weaver

175
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Is the secret identity

176
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
It's possible

177
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
A regular life

178
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
She's rainbow snatch

179
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
It was a disaster

180
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
It made me laugh

181
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Very hard

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Another episode Alex's

183
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Defensive Trump's Pocahontas

184
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Discount

185
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Why

186
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Literally

187
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:48,959
The only difference I could come up with whatever whenever the news came out and I was going through all this

188
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Sounds like he's dissing Naked Gun sketch

189
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
That's the difference

190
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Jeff look at how hilarious it is

191
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
Would go to the Navajo windtalkers Association

192
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
Make a racist

193
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
Hilarious little bit it's so funny looking glass

194
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
The funny thing

195
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,399
Was plays the video of it talking over a guy

196
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
Actually was rainbow smash doing that

197
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Higher thing word for word

198
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
That'd be a great B

199
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Hilarious

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Orange

201
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Dumbass president

202
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
Yeah which makes it

203
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Less Fun

204
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Still very fun

205
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
So

206
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
That was a couple days ago and shockingly

207
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Music

208
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
You know that's

209
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,591
He's defended the law

210
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
The amount of buildup you did on the feminist baby business

211
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
It would be last

212
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
4 months it doesn't bring it up again

213
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,695
As I've got it so he's got to jump around will get into today

214
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,815
This episode I've been listening to Alex Jones per year straight now

215
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
And I have never heard an episode end on a cliffhanger

216
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
Avenger ending

217
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,823
Eli's radio

218
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Come back tomorrow I want to find out what happened it's pretty crazy

219
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Special episode

220
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Indeed

221
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
With powerful

222
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Who is Ben

223
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Then that accused of sexual harassment

224
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Solidcore

225
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,703
Keeler Matt Lauer is apparently a Sex Dungeon

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
Reek automatically

227
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
Rewild

228
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Those things

229
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,943
Come out interesting Lee Alakazam

230
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Strange take

231
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Specifically on Garrison Keillor and on Matt Lauer

232
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,927
Very weird is it going to get into personal and professional jealousy territory

233
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
No not really

234
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Conspiracies

235
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
Like that's my that's my imagination of what is

236
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
These folks

237
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
The women aren't strong with a man are good luck

238
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
The children are above average

239
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
4016

240
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Is very strange

241
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Take

242
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
People

243
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
And that is a minority

244
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
On the verge of collapsing

245
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,199
That's why all the Prairie Home Companion guy

246
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Charlie Rose they're all people with big fat

247
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,207
But everybody wants to shove overboard because the systems collapsing

248
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
Viewers investors anymore they're all done

249
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
The golden

250
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
The altars

251
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
The IRA

252
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Because the

253
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
It doesn't work anymore

254
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
They built

255
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
They built these so-called Stars up

256
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
To make the public

257
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
They're throwing them overboard

258
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Okay

259
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Yeah

260
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
Maybe my favorite take on this entire situation I've ever heard

261
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
It's interesting his conspiracy theories

262
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
These guys

263
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
This is true everybody's known they've been sexual harasser

264
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
They've been protected

265
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Yeah right

266
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
V

267
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
The companies now

268
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
I like

269
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
The people get

270
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
Rid of these guys

271
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,487
25 million dollars on Matt Lauer this year

272
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
Yeah sexual harassment Bad Wolf

273
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Skippy's f****** out of here

274
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,191
Let's get some bargain-basement sexual harassers in here because they can do just as good

275
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,823
Press blade how's it going

276
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
I don't try to answer

277
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
Unrelated question is

278
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Cranberry splash

279
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
Ciara mr. comes out

280
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
PRL

281
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
Tournament

282
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Fandroid I understand we're trying to run a show

283
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,727
I think it's even weirder

284
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,687
It's a regular Coca-Cola

285
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Come on delicious

286
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Alex's

287
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
Pretending that there is no awareness that these people are sexual harasser

288
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
It's just a thing

289
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,047
The media is falling apart no one watching the shows anymore we got to get out of contract

290
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
And so

291
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
We are just going to

292
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
Throw them in off the bus or whatever

293
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,311
Black Ops multiple levels

294
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
You can say

295
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
All of the eclipse of the accusers

296
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
Not just those guys but then by association

297
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
All accusers everywhere right

298
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
In order to make sure that

299
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Powerful people get their contract

300
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,207
Yeah so every sexual harassment accuser is a false

301
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Kind of

302
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
The easiest kind of in that

303
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
Most are fake

304
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Credibly

305
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,823
Version of the narrative

306
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Simpler explanation

307
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Powerful dudes

308
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
Think they can do anything and then

309
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
A very simple explanation is too much power they abused it

310
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Problem-solve

311
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
You know that's from absolute power corrupts absolute

312
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Power corrupts absolutely

313
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
You know how we know that

314
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
I am amazed how surprised most people are to find out that it's

315
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Also shoutout to the chat room root beer sucks

316
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,343
Music videos of this week

317
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,207
Weirdly Cornett number 21 for the

318
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Next Gold Cobra

319
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Not my locker what I'm seeing here

320
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
Anyway I looked back into this

321
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Other day

322
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
I started this morning

323
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
Real early by retweeting

324
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Videos of alleged

325
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Attack

326
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
Naked Gun level in San Ramon

327
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
First organization here in a little bit

328
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
And so

329
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
In response to this

330
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Paul Joseph Watson

331
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Even tweeted

332
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,767
Hey whoever's running the President social media

333
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Needs to be a little more careful

334
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
That's the

335
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,423
Paul Joseph Watson even

336
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,543
Grace Bader extraordinary career out of

337
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
Look at what these Muslims are going to f****** yeah

338
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
It's like hey what what casino

339
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,759
First knows their history better than

340
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Trump

341
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,647
I'm so he's like you're going to not want to be associated with them witches

342
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
Smart right but then at the same time

343
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Tweet he was saying

344
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Who runs the

345
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Different social medias res even trying to get drunk off the hook for yet

346
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
It's really it is interesting

347
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
To me the division that

348
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
They are with him being like

349
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
He's not saying the contact was bad

350
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
It's just the source of it

351
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
The problem there is

352
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
The only person dumb enough

353
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Holding Twitter's

354
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
Are holding Trump's Twitter account

355
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
To do that

356
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Is Trump

357
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,047
Forensic evidence Trump personally

358
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
Is everybody with any level of x

359
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Receives would go

360
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Owner of that a bad idea

361
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
Only the dumbest man in the White House

362
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Whatever dude

363
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,151
Let me be clear also has clownin

364
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
You are not thinking this is reason

365
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
No no

366
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
We are not condoning no it's just interesting to me that on some level

367
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
He understands

368
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
That there's a line

369
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
At least a line of Association

370
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,119
Look at. Cross associated with

371
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
F****** Infowars

372
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
In Britain

373
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
They have

374
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
You kept which is a party built

375
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
Entirely around races

376
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
More or less everyone knows you

377
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
A party built entirely around Ray

378
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
And in the larger context

379
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
To Britton they're like

380
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
We're going to let you guys be

381
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Even UK

382
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Looks at Britton first and goes

383
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
Well we can't be having this s***

384
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
That's how far right there

385
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,935
I want to kill black people ukur crazy

386
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
Still comes down to two

387
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Optics

388
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
You know that's still really the issue people have

389
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
It's not the content

390
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
Did Paul Joseph Watson

391
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Complain about crack

392
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Those guys

393
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,087
Right right

394
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Pretty f***** up what's even more f***** up

395
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
Is Alex's take on Paul Joseph Watson

396
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,960
Kill us all

397
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
We'd all turned against Trump

398
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Multiple times said

399
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm going to turn on trop and he does accent

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,456
Literally said I'm off the Trump train

401
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Right

402
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Berry waffle

403
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
But think about

404
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Eatbook

405
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Exactly

406
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Cuz it's too easy to clown on in for that

407
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
Anyway let's get the rest of the clip

408
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
No that's the price

409
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Present

410
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
Are the ones hyping up the cultural take over the West

411
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,344
I wasn't mad

412
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,304
Literally hundreds of publication

413
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
That is tweet

414
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,448
Paul Watson

415
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
You are

416
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
Moerlein

417
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Okay

418
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
Nobody's really saying that you're turning again

419
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Phone number really saying is

420
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Look at how dumb this guy is

421
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Even people are like that

422
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Even people who are like

423
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,400
Spiritually and philosophically further down the

424
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
The f*****-up Rabbit Hole or like this

425
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Is not good

426
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Yeah

427
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
So the other thing

428
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Okay

429
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,200
The media halfway defended Trump when he wouldn't

430
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Condemn

431
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Charlottesville

432
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Murder

433
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
Good people on both sides

434
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Now it's

435
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
F****** Alex Jones was like

436
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
That's probably somebody else

437
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
You can't look

438
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Even if you don't want to condemn them

439
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
Do it all all white racism right

440
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
Right that blew up

441
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
How bad is this

442
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
Even Alex Jones has to be like 10 guys why are you talkin about about Trump on this one

443
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
You like

444
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
My bad

445
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
One of the big stories that Alex

446
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Railing on

447
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
Today is about

448
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
There are there was like a video that came out of

449
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
People being sold into slavery

450
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
Likes lightbox

451
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
I want to be fair to Global slave trade is big

452
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:51,712
Even in the states

453
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Think the estimation

454
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
They're like

455
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
Somatic waves

456
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Somatic

457
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Good job trying to dress

458
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
There's a stomach issue

459
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
It doesn't really stupid s*** about

460
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Slavery

461
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
Uses racial slur

462
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
He's trying to pretend that they have the n-word in the Quran

463
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
Under Islam

464
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,888
You can enslave them

465
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Arab slave trade

466
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
Out of the Old Testament

467
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
Mark of Cain

468
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
And the rest of it was on

469
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Transatlantic slave trade

470
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,864
Control

471
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
I also felt in Oregon

472
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Black

473
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
None of that's true

474
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
It's not even close

475
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Timeline set

476
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
Not really

477
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Yeah

478
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
Say

479
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Chomping at the bit there

480
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
My point is

481
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
All of the stuff is wrong

482
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
True

483
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Leg purple what's amazing about that

484
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Is he started Opera

485
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,400
And then he was like

486
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
I'm pretty sure that

487
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
But what if I go here and that was

488
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
And then it got wrong

489
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:58,944
And then somehow it got wrong or still usually in this situation what happened

490
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
Snow is generally

491
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
Spiral into the correct

492
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,208
Like historically

493
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Explain this

494
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
Right historically eventually he could

495
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
To like

496
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,632
This is accurate actual historic history

497
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,240
A couple hundred years before this.

498
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,800
Kind of troops

499
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
But he was still wrong about the

500
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
And he really went hard on the

501
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Arab slave trade

502
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
So

503
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Around Europe

504
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,192
The Iberian Peninsula from the time of like 782

505
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,056
Yo into the 1300's and what have you

506
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Be taken into account and then

507
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
Every culture back then

508
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Slavery

509
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
Because they found

510
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
Overtime that it was much more economic

511
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Slave everybody in

512
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,488
Very usable

513
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
Group of people

514
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,888
I do all the work they don't want to do create Leisure for themselves

515
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
Humans for human Saget's absolutely

516
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Universal through cultures

517
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,824
Greece

518
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Was full of slaves

519
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Rod wave

520
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
All of it

521
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Like it's just continued

522
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
But then

523
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,016
The thing that we need to really address

524
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Is the Arab slave trade

525
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Evolve

526
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Into the African and

527
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
Then European slave trade

528
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
That was a product of Portugal

529
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
In the mid-1400s

530
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Portugal at the time

531
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
Wasn't a mint

532
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
Immensely successful

533
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Nautical coasters

534
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:00,032
They were amazing at shipbuilding and one things that was your shoe today

535
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
Is it they were the first people that were able to

536
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
To Get Around the Horn of Africa

537
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,456
They were able to get down there

538
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
The slave Coast

539
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
With a large area of countries like

540
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Nigeria

541
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
A couple others I can't remember

542
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Diane Daywood

543
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Just go in and they would take a bunch of people

544
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
He was 1442

545
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
I was when they first

546
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
I started taking people from Africa

547
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Do you know who is on those

548
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Ships that Columbus

549
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
I don't know

550
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Magellan

551
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,800
Know-all Portugal's are Muslim

552
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
That you could argue because

553
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:39,456
AMC 20

554
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Or at least the Arabs

555
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
It's not

556
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
If there's water.

557
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
Is a lot of different types of

558
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,512
But they did end up taking a lot of the Iberian Peninsula weatherbeeta Portugal Spain

559
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,840
All of that area but there's a thing called the Reconquista

560
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,912
That happened between

561
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
The 1800's and the 1400s

562
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Where in

563
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
The white

564
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,664
People took back over the Iberian Peninsula

565
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,248
Cambridge was not under Islamic rule it was not under Arab rule

566
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Are you sure

567
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Positive

568
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
I don't think you can be

569
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
I'm absolutely positive

570
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
You know what

571
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Egypt

572
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Okay

573
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,816
Brake and argue with that

574
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,888
It's complete nonsense it's all

575
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,776
History in service of demon season 7 of game

576
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,384
Game of Thrones in that all of his dates kind of move around to the point where it doesn't make any sense

577
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,992
Right

578
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Inspirit

579
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
And I agree with Alex not at all

580
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,344
So that sucks

581
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,416
I wish you would realize

582
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Possible that

583
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Have you studied any

584
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Because we

585
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
We see how

586
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Slowly Kiri

587
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
On the show

588
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Cuz he reads

589
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Something

590
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
It does not go 50 it's the reading equivalent of Hunter

591
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
Keyboard

592
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
Slow typing slow reader

593
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
He reads with two

594
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,480
Fingers metaphorically ever read

595
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Like just

596
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,296
Example

597
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Eco sign

598
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
11:00

599
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
The f****** text

600
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
There's literally no way that his

601
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Swole ask that

602
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
Within the time constraints

603
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,632
3 hours a day radio

604
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
Make these dumbass special reports

605
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
And

606
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
Apparently he's in charge of the marketing

607
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
Department head Infowars creating the specials

608
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Trying to get all the product out the door

609
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,480
All that's what there's no way he has time to read any of the stuff he says he's reading

610
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,296
There is one

611
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Okay

612
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
He's a world-class

613
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Oh yeah

614
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
Like a world-class Kim

615
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
Lexus headlight

616
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
The way that you rambled nonsense

617
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,424
So confidently he's confident

618
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Read a book

619
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,312
Like you got the broad Strokes of the book and he didn't even get that

620
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
No

621
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
It's all confidential

622
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
Sound and Fury signifying nothing

623
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,344
Bulshit with the cliff notes of history and thought that meant

624
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
That meant he learn

625
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Because

626
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
You know

627
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
He's going to claim

628
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
He's looked into Britain

629
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
President Donald Trump

630
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
Retweeted three videos posted by Christian activist

631
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Jada

632
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
President

633
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
That was speaking out against Sharia in

634
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
Britain first party

635
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
And issued a police present Trump

636
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,312
Two years of convicted for Islam

637
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Terrorism rally in Belfast

638
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Ireland

639
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Say what you want about

640
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
Group there

641
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
Serious issues with

642
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
I was sure you'll be next

643
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,120
3 the game trying to trigger that that first they came for the blanks

644
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,008
I think you caught a lot you were scribbling Christian nationalist

645
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
Christian nationalist

646
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Is

647
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
Maybe the best euphemism

648
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
That I've heard

649
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
Because once again

650
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
Let's listen breakdown Christian

651
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Brave

652
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
I mean that.

653
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
Christian nationalist come

654
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
What are you name

655
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Name a curse

656
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
When you close your eyes and think of Krista

657
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Billy Graham

658
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Okay

659
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Jim Bakker

660
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
I don't know Alex Jones

661
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
Is it anybody black

662
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,944
Know anybody brown

663
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,344
Hot women either

664
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:40,768
She's dead and she can't hurt us if she also turned against

665
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
Turned out but I guess this is Jayda fransen

666
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Which is too close to my last name for comfort

667
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
Speaking out against Islam

668
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,080
They were charged with religiously aggravated harassment

669
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
It was an anti-terrorist

670
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
We got a lot of euphemisms in there

671
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Propaganda

672
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Fake bulshit

673
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
About Muslim

674
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
For putting out propaganda

675
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
Roosevelt don't post like all kinds of mislead

676
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
About like people celebrating

677
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Soccer win

678
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,544
That shot manipulative lie to make it look like Muslim Zariah.

679
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
At least if I recalled

680
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,944
Who plays the same game when he has like fireworks displays and he's like

681
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Play on people

682
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Like that

683
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Incredibly

684
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:40,416
Apparently the first party got in trouble

685
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Because they had images of

686
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
British crown on their merchandise

687
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
Ridgeview a branding issue

688
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
Al Capone Humana vision of racism is what that is

689
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
The advertising standards

690
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Authority in

691
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
They had to take it off because

692
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,664
Symbol

693
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
Would imply they were selling merchandise

694
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
That was British man

695
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Under the

696
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
What have you

697
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Sisters fun

698
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,416
But it is like

699
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Okay

700
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Both parties are dumb

701
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Right

702
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
You should be able to put the crown on

703
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,888
I don't really care

704
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Is these three

705
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,592
If you get down to

706
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
Not

707
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,712
Yeah so one of them

708
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,088
Is a Muslim Muslim beats beats up Dutch boy on crutches

709
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,648
Hi the fake video it was created by website

710
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Call dumpert

711
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:49,280
Destroy the statue of the Virgin Mary

712
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,120
Claire Cruz Affiliated without the al-nusra front

713
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
It's not even

714
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
The other one the video islamist bushes

715
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Teenage boy off Route

716
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
And beat him to death

717
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Was actually of a young cleric

718
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Critic of Mohamed Morsi

719
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Be beating up

720
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
2030

721
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Amidst the unrest of morsi's

722
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Overthrow

723
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
So they're not really

724
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
They're presenting the Arabs

725
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,768
Yeah same way Alex presents all this all this b******* about

726
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
The the

727
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
And what have you

728
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
He's acting like it

729
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Random attack

730
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
I want

731
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Legit fake

732
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,872
The other two are one in the middle and the other was in the middle of an overthrow

733
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
And the person who was the victim of it was a Critic

734
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Of the deposed

735
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
All Muslims

736
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
So

737
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,648
You know the term fake news is toothless

738
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Meaningless

739
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Yeah but in this case beat

740
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
3 videos that were being

741
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
That were repeated

742
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Propaganda

743
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Absolutely

744
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,216
We're probably only demonizing

745
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
All Muslims

746
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Here's my

747
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Skype

748
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
This does not matter

749
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
The president's role in a does

750
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Fake news

751
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
This is not news

752
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Here's a here's the point okay what did we learn

753
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
From Trump

754
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
Well we already knew that you was a violin

755
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
So I guess we didn't learn that okay what else

756
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
We learned

757
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
He's dumb but we already knew that

758
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
2

759
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
I don't know I guess not much

760
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
You have actually written down

761
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,080
The first two on the things that I've written you said the first two on the things that I wrote down as the things we already knew

762
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Oh yeah yeah

763
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
All of this

764
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
It doesn't dissolve it

765
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
In line with everything we already know about

766
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Now that's true

767
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
It's not it's nothing singing like 3 million immigrants

768
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
Illegal immigrants voting

769
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Things that are not

770
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Become news when the

771
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Doing them and their bigoted

772
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
Again

773
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
That's that's important it's not on the pile

774
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
The theory that there is no Trump stories

775
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Is there's one trumps

776
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
If you are writing a trump story it should be

777
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
Impeach the president impeached a president impeached president impeached

778
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
There's no point writing Trump

779
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Blanks

780
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
No it's probably true

781
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
It doesn't matter

782
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Theresa may look like a giant

783
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:42,080
Well she came out and said don't do that what is everybody in Britain called

784
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
You should revoke his abilities

785
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Hold on

786
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Maybe Corbin will do that

787
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
But

788
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Anyway

789
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
We haven't had a lot of Russia

790
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
The talk lately

791
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
Alex has not been super on mielec

792
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Discuss Russia

793
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,816
He drops this little Chestnut in as he's going through

794
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Today's news breakdown

795
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,984
Before election

796
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
Hear the lamp the saying if you're white especially

797
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Bright

798
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
That's a weird policy

799
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,160
Well-hit the implication that he's

800
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,488
He's making is that like food in his paint white people to have

801
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Narrative

802
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
Yeah

803
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Do you think Alex saw that was like

804
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Solution to wipe

805
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Reproduce

806
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Absolutely

807
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
You said as much already

808
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,576
See now that's an interesting fact

809
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Alright

810
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,416
You pay people to become the majority

811
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Now that's a really interesting

812
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,584
It would take Joe take the generation would be a delay in it

813
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,960
It's stupid but it's just another way of him like he complains about birth rates.

814
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Right

815
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
He's using Putin

816
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
As an example of someone who

817
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Who's doing it right

818
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
Babies they won't even pay

819
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Imma just goes back to

820
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,272
Ghetto white identification White

821
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
So anyway

822
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
There's another narrative

823
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Bombshell

824
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
It will end up leading to the cliff

825
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,280
The introduction of it

826
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Apparently

827
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
All right haha

828
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Season of Breaking Bad

829
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
Apparently

830
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
There's a university

831
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Somewhere near Austin

832
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
One of their colomont

833
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
No

834
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Something-or-other

835
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Okay

836
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Wonder columnist

837
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:00,319
Wrote an article about how most of the people he's ever met in his life

838
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Have not been great

839
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,743
Here's the

840
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Alex Jones

841
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Being Furious about it

Newswars.com

845
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Campus reform

Abomination

849
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Albuquerque

850
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
Texas State University student newspaper on the front

851
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Is an abomination

852
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
We should get a physical copy of it

853
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
We up photos

854
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Professor Spears

855
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Lovers

Police officers Etc

857
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
Call mrs. Rudy Martinez

858
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
Wow what a racist

00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Brett

860
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Great

861
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
No

862
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
No

863
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Possibly two

864
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,871
Probably

865
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,431
That's just kind of how we work right I guess so

866
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,735
So this is a guy who's

867
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Tutorial Rider

868
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
Alex, you are already in the corner before it even began

869
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
It just makes me think

870
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
How much

871
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
Walking fun I would have with them

872
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,191
It's like when I was in college I wrote for my campus paper

873
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
3 years I wrote editorials for

874
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
For the man-eater University of Missouri newspaper editorial

875
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
Become s*** talking is the greatest thing you've ever heard

876
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
Incredible hot water for an article I wrote about how all farmer

877
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
Who is Jack off cows

878
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
F****** deathreats

879
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,863
Kick me out of college

880
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
So much fun people to kiss my ass send me aggressive emails out kiss my ass

881
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Wolf

882
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
If Alex Jones

883
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
When I was in college

884
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Taking my article

885
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
And started lying about it misrepresenting it

886
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,599
And turning it into something like one of his narrative

887
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
I would have been like

888
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,975
F*** you

889
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,791
I'll be sitting there drunk as s*** and just like

890
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
I would OD all I talked about

891
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
How is it that he's get this

892
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:05,151
It's f****** idiot editorial writers and he still hasn't found out about us b******* because he's not afraid

893
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
Read of them I don't mean to

894
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,783
I don't mean as narcissistically he should be

895
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,343
Like the fact that we take the time

896
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
You struck the things

897
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:20,255
Like the Muslim slave trade name it isn't the one we did way back though

898
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,815
We deal with him in a way that

899
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
He's not being dealt with by other people

900
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,703
And I think he should be scared of giving us any kind of promotion

901
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:34,847
Even if it's these guys are f****** globalist I know Soros paying them threat something like that that even would be Danger

902
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Anything that would get us more attention

903
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:41,759
Very dangerous

904
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Just use that guy as a prop now it was me

905
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
In college

906
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Can you get that

907
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:55,839
Because I'm dangerously Alex Jones

908
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,519
Hey it's this look he can punch that guy over there

909
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,335
Lowrider is going

910
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
Hope you have a little bit of it

911
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,247
In contact with us I hope he has been spirit in him because if I was then

912
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,807
I would get on it I would get on Alex's show

913
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,367
Yeah cuz I know he would want to have me on the show

914
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,719
Wasted mockery of the preceding

915
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
I didn't actually read it

916
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
Editorial

917
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,663
Girl f****** trash

918
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
We can throw

919
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
Let's move along I just have a lot of

920
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
About what I could have done

921
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
I'm sorry Dan

922
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
Oh well

923
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Editorial

924
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Alex

925
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
The earlier was talking about her food

926
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
It's going to pay white people to reproduce

927
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Yes

928
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,479
Text Matthew has a little article about policy that

929
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Makes perfect sense.

930
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,343
Article

931
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
He does not get into the article

932
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,207
The read the headline of an article and talk about how it's important

933
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
About Muslims

934
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
Who's taking over demographically in Europe

935
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
And the source of it

936
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,919
It's going to go from 1% to 3%

937
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Possibly

938
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
Yeah

939
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
So

940
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Whataburger

941
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,159
From Alex's last marathon

942
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Is it he launched in

943
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
New product

944
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
The real red

945
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,607
And from what we've been able to

946
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
Discern

947
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
It's a multi

948
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,775
It's a multivitamin that turns you into an aware

949
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Socially representative

950
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
It also has a steroid

951
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Precursor

952
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
I promise there's no stimulants

953
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:30,207
Sing a song he does so many f****** commercials for this

954
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,535
Real wrestling

955
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
That I thought was really funny

956
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
And completely safe

957
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
I don't think that's weird ringing endorsement

958
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,479
Don't

959
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,575
I like it when you have to tell me something is totally

960
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
And completely

961
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,183
Yeah yeah if you were like

962
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
Take this it's completely safe

963
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
If I would be like that

964
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
That doesn't sound good

965
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,327
If you said it's totally and completely

966
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
Do not trust you at all

967
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
Giada's like Deuteronomy

968
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
I'm not,

969
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:20,895
2015 we discovered that Alex stole Hillary for prison

970
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,711
A bumper sticker that sauce and turned it into a

971
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Million-dollar

972
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,087
No bum rushing Hillary

973
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Some stuff like that

974
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,927
Clippy admits that he stole the name

975
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
Real red pill

976
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,607
12

977
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
I know it's not surprising

978
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
But it is important that we document

979
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,455
Like legitimately howling

980
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Creative Alex

981
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
He stole one of his biggest things were above

982
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,647
Sticker that you saw and admitting that he just stole this from The Matrix

983
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
Conversion

984
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
I just don't I just don't find this one to be surprised

985
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,983
Surprising it's just about putting it on the record

986
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,383
Documenting your right

987
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
He's on creative in

988
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Mister is a plagiarist

989
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
To a great extent

990
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Sounds like a plan

991
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Anyway

992
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Who's next

993
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Alex Jones

994
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Juno

995
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Define

996
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
Is

997
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
Over-inflated

998
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
And his importance

999
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,447
In the world no idea pretend

1000
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:53,311
Callers that lie to him rcia sources and stuff like that

1001
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
The FBI guy

1002
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
I literally

1003
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
Not allowed to keep up

1004
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:06,367
I cannot keep up so I know you've been slacking or keeping up but

1005
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
The FBI caller who is shooting at the Las Vegas shooting

1006
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:18,655
Who Alex said the FBI contacted 20 minutes after he was on the phone

1007
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,775
Write all this

1008
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
Or something

1009
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,111
The Narrative has escalated incredibly

1010
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
Believe a lick of it

1011
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
Close

1012
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:48,095
Undisclosed

1013
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,727
Did think the reason I wanted to bring that up is I want to play a little bit of Alex's game

1014
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
The conspiracy game

1015
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,567
Before I do I want to make it clear that Galaxy

1016
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Is making all this up

1017
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
And the father is bullshiting

1018
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
Of course but if he's not

1019
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
Who called in and was revealing information

1020
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,879
The only way that the FBI would have been able to

1021
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Find out who he is

1022
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
That quickly

1023
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
And lock him up

1024
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
Is it Alex tipped him off

1025
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,863
I've Alex snitched on the guy to the FBI

1026
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
Or watching

1027
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
Who is who is

1028
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,287
In every world

1029
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:35,711
Suggested that he sold out his source

1030
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
Reviewing sources over and over again

1031
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
Really possible

1032
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,671
Like I said

1033
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
What is importance

1034
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Threatened by

1035
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
About what

1036
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:54,399
Covers level

1037
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,543
Convenience

1038
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Also

1039
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,871
That's not the only thing that off the record covers

1040
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,319
It's not like just right

1041
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
You can't say it

1042
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,999
If I don't leave the Muslims alone

1043
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
Guess what I'm sipping down

1044
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Get ready

1045
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
The big Torpedoes are coming

1046
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,623
That's how I go to the Heights

1047
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:57,119
I'm going to go after radical Islam Orthodoxy

1048
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
I'm going to go out to the public

1049
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
For letting me know where you're at

1050
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
I'm coming for you

1051
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,367
Will

1052
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,671
The Open Fire politically as well

1053
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
Statements like you

1054
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
Without me

1055
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,911
Cuz it's all about me it's all about my family

1056
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,751
About me cuz it's all about me. That

1057
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,567
Other people's lives

1058
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:47,551
Other people's future

1059
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
You got that

1060
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,815
There's a lot of things

1061
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Describing conversations

1062
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
His lawyers

1063
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
I probably do

1064
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Lesbian like okay

1065
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
Here's what you said

1066
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,735
And here's how we're going to lose it in jeopardy

1067
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,271
Here's how we're going to lose all of our men

1068
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
You're my favorite client

1069
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:27,231
I am going to charge you all the money hours on Alex

1070
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:32,351
First of all it's not about me it's all about anything

1071
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,447
Cuz I think that he is

1072
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:42,847
It's the race.

1073
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
Trying to tap into that like

1074
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
My ancestors are right here

1075
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,015
Yeah I kind of think we are all the same person

1076
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
To some extent

1077
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
Empathic

1078
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,159
I do really like that kind

1079
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Kind of thought that like

1080
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,463
You and I are essentially the

1081
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
The same person just living

1082
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,047
Via the Great Big Blob

1083
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,447
Yeah I made the Buddhist empathy on yourself

1084
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,287
But I clearly it has not been cut

1085
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:18,687
In order to successfully do that

1086
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,319
This to me feels

1087
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Real

1088
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Tired

1089
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
Like

1090
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,463
To work himself up in like

1091
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,535
They just can't get over the hill into like the I'm going to

1092
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
Scream and yell and what happened I don't know why

1093
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,679
Baby no brain force in the studio or something along those lines

1094
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
But it does feel a bit different

1095
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Normal

1096
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
He's not capable of turning over the

1097
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
I think I think there might be

1098
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,807
James in motion right there might be some sort of like

1099
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Stimulant withdrawal

1100
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Something like that

1101
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,463
Cuz you know how much of the brain Force

1102
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,999
Then you're out the warehouse

1103
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,167
True

1104
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Alex

1105
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Either

1106
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,639
Good-byes everything for the year on Cyber Monday

1107
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Used to cut coupons

1108
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
What you going to do

1109
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,271
Probably still kept coupon

1110
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
Alex Jones

1111
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Put up a video

1112
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Let me ask you a

1113
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,047
Do you think it's today

1114
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,143
Or do you think it's a larger trend of him not being able to really talk

1115
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Turn it off

1116
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,031
He's really got ghost

1117
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,335
The beginning of that feminist baby riff

1118
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,895
That was he was on

1119
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,503
For sure

1120
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
The beginning part of that baby feminas riff

1121
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
He was on for sure is not a sentence

1122
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:10,047
Did I ever want to hear you not get to the store because he knew it was weak

1123
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
He was on

1124
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Like like

1125
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,911
Yeah it was good

1126
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,215
But

1127
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,799
Did put out a video about him

1128
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Like

1129
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
Basically praying on air

1130
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,455
Which we've seen him do a bit

1131
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,527
Defensive about it

1132
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
Really weird

1133
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Real weird

1134
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:39,999
Right wing watch

1135
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
Alex Jones called on the power

1136
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,471
Jesus Christ

1137
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,519
So Alex

1138
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
He thinks we're going to get to the crazy part.

1139
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,663
He thinks that they're like they hate Chris

1140
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,735
Then what have you but the reality is that

1141
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,295
Don't even let their daughters date until they run away at 8

1142
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,855
Making fun of

1143
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
How he does

1144
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,415
It's so fake

1145
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,719
Our first episode

1146
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Ever

1147
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
It's time to pray

1148
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,519
Stoffel and that's really more with her making fun of it

1149
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,335
He's screaming about hating people and demons and

1150
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Holland

1151
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Econo brake

1152
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:32,479
That's why your Godless losers Phil

1153
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:37,343
You're so disconnected

1154
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
The word

1155
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:02,431
Dutch government says this video of a kid

1156
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
England

1157
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,439
Get three more example

1158
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
And the police department

1159
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,863
Not true Alex don't tell people to type it in

1160
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,007
Through

1161
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,823
New York time

1162
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
Fox News apologizes for false claims of Muslim only areas in England and France

1163
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Who is issued a nun

1164
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,903
Usual on-air apology on Saturday night for having allowed its anchors at gas to repeat the folks claim that there are Muslim

1165
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,231
I'm only no go zones at European countries like England and France

1166
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:51,327
That are not under the control of this in a ruled according to Sharia law

1167
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,911
The statement was referred to as a correction by the fox report host

1168
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:01,311
Julie Banderas over the course of this last week we made some regrettable errors on air

1169
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
Muslim population in Europe

1170
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,151
Particularly with regard to England and France

1171
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,967
Wow now this applies especially to

1172
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,575
Discussions of no-go zones areas where non-muslims allegedly are not allowed in

1173
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,903
Harrisonville

1174
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
Quotes

1175
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:20,767
To be clear there is no formal designation of these zones and either country

1176
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
The assertion

1177
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,871
That's an even notoriously stupid a diplomatic New York Times

1178
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,735
Fox News issued a rare apology which might might as well read like

1179
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:47,391
Notoriously low Bard Fox News

1180
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,279
Fox News

1181
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:59,679
No existed for that

1182
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
You can do this to like

1183
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
You can look into it if you want

1184
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
You can take a little bit.

1185
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
Confined

1186
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,895
It's 450 all these ideas

1187
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:13,247
I mean like this is one of the things they talked about all the time with sweet and they talk about Malmo

1188
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
City of Malmo being like

1189
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
The only Muslim

1190
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,695
Absolutely not true it's it's

1191
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:26,303
There are videos much like the ones Trump Paul Joseph Watson makes hang out of

1192
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Inderal

1193
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
Complete

1194
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,423
Baradar misrepresented videos

1195
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
Like again I can't stress enough

1196
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
The idea that Paul Joseph Watson

1197
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,639
Would have a video of a New Year celebration where people are short Bastille Day

1198
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
When were they shooting off fireworks

1199
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
And claimed that it

1200
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Muslim hordes run-amok

1201
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Memes

1202
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
Nothing is credible

1203
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
But like you're at your standard

1204
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
Is it what you're doing there are out the window

1205
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:56,255
And so whenever you have these people who reporting on these Muslim no-go Zone

1206
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Generally stuff

1207
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
Stuff like that

1208
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,839
Lindsey bulshit

1209
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
It's frustrating to me that

1210
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Because that's

1211
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,239
It's like the one truth of America

1212
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
Is the one truth

1213
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
Of immigrants

1214
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Google anywhere

1215
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
Which is not one of them agree

1216
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,895
Drink go somewhere

1217
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
They just want

1218
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Reek

1219
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
Create their home

1220
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,015
Go somewhere

1221
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:23,647
They become part of somewhere new what America is like

1222
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
New Orleans

1223
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,023
You don't go there because you see a different group of people

1224
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,839
Everywhere you go there because you see all of these

1225
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
These people creating something new

1226
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
Beautiful girl wanted to join the place there let me take that even one step further

1227
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
I live in uptown

1228
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:48,479
Chicago outfit

1229
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:54,879
That were just as one of the examples of the little as cultural enclaves

1230
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:59,487
And there are places like that which is

1231
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,023
Which is the affirmation

1232
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
The other side of

1233
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Experience

1234
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:08,191
To become a part of the whole but at the same time we were taking two pieces of you

1235
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:12,031
Your culture appreciate them adjoining your culture

1236
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:17,663
On a facsimile level within America

1237
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,271
To even bring both lungs into it when I was growing up there was a mosque

1238
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
In Columbia Missouri there was

1239
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,903
I don't know couple blocks from downtown

1240
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
Whatever that means in a small town

1241
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
But like I would go to the mosque

1242
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,559
I would go with my family we go in

1243
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
Then just go to other

1244
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
Cultures

1245
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,983
Festivals

1246
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
Cuban Festival

1247
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
Puerto Rican festival

1248
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,991
Don't go there and see all of these Cuban people

1249
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,807
The f*** off

1250
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:02,207
Is everybody like chick dish General

1251
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
But it's not like

1252
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,815
The Halloween costume version of appropriation you know like

1253
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,863
Mexican Festival in

1254
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,007
Just drunk white people in Cinco de Mayo

1255
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,895
Which is a weird which is one of the weirder like

1256
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,943
Okay

1257
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Just about boobs

1258
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
And

1259
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
Chasing snakes out of everywhere

1260
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,183
It's less about what the holiday isn't how it's become

1261
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Associated with booze

1262
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
Immigrants that go places

1263
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
We all want

1264
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
Totally

1265
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
The bigger picture

1266
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,519
You know you can have those examples of Cinco de Mayo and Saint Patrick

1267
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,055
If you look at the bigger pic

1268
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,407
All those other awesome little fast

1269
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Send

1270
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
Block party

1271
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,527
Do you want to know

1272
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,831
Do you want to know what the best thing to show people

1273
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,415
Immigrants

1274
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,279
It's such a strangely accurate immigrants

1275
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,775
With the image of white nationalism in your head

1276
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,335
I kind of get it but

1277
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,175
Prince

1278
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,967
Daughter grows up

1279
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
Speaking unaccented English like all of this s***

1280
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
And they get that

1281
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,879
Feeling of like well we want you

1282
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,647
You two have some sore

1283
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
To your Homeland

1284
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
Integrated

1285
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
Into your new home

1286
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Fears coming together

1287
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
Also

1288
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
Oh my God Dan Aykroyd

1289
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,239
Basic condoms are gum

1290
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
Wild

1291
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,823
Smell weird

1292
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:02,015
Like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a surprising review of getting culture in New York City and delay

1293
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Play 80s

1294
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,367
A surprising review of Evergreen crunch

1295
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,695
Culture in the late 90s

1296
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:15,583
This isn't like that clip

1297
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:20,191
So Tim has nightclub Alex Jones reveals that he has a nuanced understanding of lesbian

1298
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
And it

1299
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
One of the more f***** up things

1300
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
On the show

1301
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:31,455
Most of the so-called liberal lesbian

1302
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,295
What's slapping girls around

1303
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,719
Most of these books

1304
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511
They want to be

1305
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,759
That Fifty Shades of Grey

1306
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,255
I'll start begging for your mom

1307
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
For a second

1308
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,655
Because he he he jumps

1309
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,727
Rub that on to something

1310
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
If possible

1311
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,543
Even more f***** up

1312
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,335
What

1313
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Okay

1314
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
I guess what he saying

1315
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
Is that

1316
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,527
First offered what he saying is

1317
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Keith hit women

1318
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Poodle

1319
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,903
That's exactly what he's saying it's not right but some like it

1320
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,487
He's saying that Stockholm Syndrome

1321
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Is actually

1322
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
Just how you're supposed to deal with

1323
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,375
I don't know what to do with that

1324
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
Well

1325
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
When he says that's not what I'm saying

1326
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
The question is

1327
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
Then what are you saying

1328
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
And the answer is

1329
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,943
I think he's saying it's okay to hit women probably on some level think that male-dominated culture that

1330
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,735
Is expressed wanting

1331
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:13,343
Well and of course if you are hitting somebody

1332
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Speaking they will say

1333
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Please don't hit

1334
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
Right in which case

1335
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
You will say no

1336
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
You're no actually mean

1337
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
You really want me

1338
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
You know the sexual Spectrum

1339
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:34,591
Is wide and some people like rough trade

1340
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:38,687
People around like

1341
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:43,039
Within the collective sexual boundaries

1342
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
His

1343
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
Is logic does not track

1344
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,903
Okay women go to lesbians

1345
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Because they

1346
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,791
Want to get hit and no man will do it right then and later on

1347
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,815
He says

1348
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
Women go

1349
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,143
Women who let men hit them

1350
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
Then they put on pigments

1351
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
No they say I'm going to torture you for 6 weeks

1352
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:08,383
Fifty Shades of Grey is a gateway drug

1353
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
I like you good tied up once and everything

1354
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,735
Spawn everything is cool but then the next time

1355
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
The door

1356
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,599
Believes about the idea of BDSM it's

1357
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,879
Stuff like that

1358
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,279
Liberals so now let's get to the rest of the stuff cuz I'm telling you it gets even more f***** up

1359
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,071
Listen to this

1360
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,167
They want to get you in a dungeon

1361
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,263
They want to strap you down

1362
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
We look in a mirror

1363
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,431
It's one thing to eat your brain now

1364
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,247
What's start

1365
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,855
Side area.

1366
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,207
I'm going to eat your cerebral cortex last

1367
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
You're going to be guilty when I say you're guilty

1368
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
Alex just watched

1369
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
That's what happened

1370
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
Do you watch that Ray Liotta scene in Hannibal

1371
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,343
Thanks for that no other way

1372
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,207
Specific reference right

1373
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
Whatever

1374
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
So real

1375
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Oh my God

1376
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
Ray Liotta that dza.

1377
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
That guy's not an actor

1378
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
Even if your talk

1379
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
Metaphoric

1380
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
Real Steel does

1381
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
It's really interesting house that's not like

1382
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,111
Really blood libel but it's real close

1383
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
You know it's not in that narrative

1384
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,743
The cannibalism aspect of it is

1385
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:06,143
Here's what I'd say

1386
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
The Europeans

1387
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
We are

1388
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:18,943
F***** up enough to get there to be fair in a land where 90% of the

1389
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,063
To be fair

1390
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,415
Can't pull the name of the guy who wrote Hannibal but

1391
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:33,791
Hannibal Buress

1392
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Alex Jones

1393
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
Earlier

1394
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
We discussed

1395
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
How Alex believes

1396
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Is there a boy

1397
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
Do they mention does he mention

1398
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,663
Hannibal how he's

1399
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
He's not going to eat

1400
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,599
Frontal cortex off the top of his head

1401
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Cuz that's

1402
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,951
Suggest a certain level of information about the brain that I would not

1403
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Nobody

1404
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,303
He's wrong also absolutely

1405
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:12,703
What does map science

1406
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
It's not that I think that's just

1407
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:19,615
Capiz lighted to see him go wild with the small amount of knowledge

1408
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,151
She does have or it's like okay

1409
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
Well if I were going to eat

1410
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Bright

1411
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:31,903
Middle parts weird the back part is lizard

1412
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,975
That's what I know he knows that the center is

1413
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:40,863
Is where everything happens around the Broca's area or on the side

1414
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
It's not

1415
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,191
Also just seen the Temple of Doom

1416
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
Straight a monkey's head there

1417
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
True

1418
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Nothing monkey

1419
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,847
Fungus art

1420
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
Anyway

1421
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
But be that as it may

1422
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,015
We talked about Muslim no-go Zone

1423
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,319
How even Fox News had to apologize

1424
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
Recovering that

1425
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
Cuz if not real

1426
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
And it makes clip

1427
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Alex jump

1428
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
There are no go zones in

1429
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:12,095
In America

1430
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Yeah

1431
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,471
Food.com soft

1432
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
Food

1433
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
But

1434
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Great

1435
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,727
Never going outside

1436
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Couple years ago and three times

1437
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,151
Very aggressive large

1438
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
Blackmail

1439
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,879
Yeah we talked about this already

1440
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
A homeless person

1441
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
Back off

1442
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
That's what happened

1443
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,007
And my wife

1444
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:35,551
I don't want to have to

1445
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,623
It's a no-go Zone

1446
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
I can't go

1447
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,975
First

1448
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,631
The Black Culture

1449
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,943
So that mean this is just racial fear

1450
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
This is all.

1451
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,295
Minority of racist blacks

1452
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,647
Minority / plurality of racist whites does not

1453
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Right there all said

1454
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,255
When I first moved to the city

1455
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Chicago that is

1456
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
I was real

1457
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Southsider going west

1458
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,871
There are some areas that aren't no go zones but their areas where you don't want to necessarily

1459
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,175
After Dark

1460
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,735
I mean

1461
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:41,855
It's a reality of the f*****-up nature of how weaves own this city

1462
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
And racist

1463
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
But I thought the entirety lights light of certain areas

1464
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
Don't go there you'll get stabbed

1465
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,799
Because that is what people throw around

1466
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
A good

1467
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
The year or so

1468
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:07,455
Not to get past that, I realized that it was probably overblown

1469
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
To the point where light

1470
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
Almost all the city is awesome

1471
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,879
I've been to East Austin there it's a great area

1472
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
That there might be

1473
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
Be dangerous

1474
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
Supernature of

1475
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Speedy's

1476
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,375
That's kind of how urban areas work

1477
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
We go through this so many different

1478
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,983
If you go by /

1479
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,775
Hundred thousand all the sudden you start

1480
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
In Chicago go down in the murder rate

1481
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
Like

1482
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:40,223
And even then you see the statistics on white on white and black on black

1483
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Crime and chances are

1484
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,831
There's a 90% chance you're going to get f***** up by somebody of your own

1485
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
Your own race

1486
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,879
Alex reject those

1487
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Statistically

1488
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
You can go to the south side

1489
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
Anytime you want

1490
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
Walk around anywhere

1491
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,071
You might get a weird look

1492
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,351
Maybe even then

1493
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,887
The only you're not going to get

1494
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,215
It hurt nobody wants nobody wants to hurt anybody else

1495
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Let's not.

1496
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,103
That's not weird that you always do at the black bee

1497
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
Have we had that talk

1498
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,455
We should probably do this all there

1499
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,015
Let me tell you how I feel about aging

1500
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,855
So

1501
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,695
If you just went on the night nowhere

1502
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:27,583
That someday is at some point

1503
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,399
Hey Asian people

1504
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,847
I mean like just this idea that he's applying this

1505
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,663
Fictional stuff about no go zones in Europe

1506
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,247
To now Austin's you can place where there are no go zones

1507
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Just he's

1508
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
So scared of everything

1509
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
It's just

1510
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
No he's not scared

1511
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
He wants you to visit

1512
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,231
Incentive

1513
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,255
To make you afraid

1514
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Bucked up

1515
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,095
What is a the police

1516
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
If you are in a

1517
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,703
One of the things that whines up making you

1518
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Uso

1519
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,263
Much more likely to be

1520
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,287
Inclusive is that

1521
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
You are included

1522
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,871
When you're included in

1523
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,199
As we were talking about earlier

1524
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,479
Cuban celebration

1525
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:19,551
You're not afraid of Cubans anymore your include

1526
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:24,415
Can you start to understand why they have that weird ham pickle mustard sandwich

1527
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,607
Is plantain isn't as bad as I thought it was

1528
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,631
But

1529
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,447
It's like a banana

1530
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,239
What anyway

1531
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
At the top of the show

1532
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
Dealt with the narrative

1533
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
That

1534
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
Matt Lauer

1535
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
Garrison Keillor

1536
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,807
Sexual assault

1537
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,111
If that isn't flipping

1538
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:58,207
Actually let Colin

1539
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
Is that what is argument

1540
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:06,655
No that doesn't come up incredibly racist and recognize that their fans are all Races to Let's Nacho

1541
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
Doesn't come up but

1542
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
I just want to stress that like

1543
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
It's not just

1544
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,055
The throwaways

1545
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:17,152
He brings it up like three or four times on the show that's really what he think

1546
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,456
Is going on which is bizarre

1547
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Siri

1548
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
Find why he would

1549
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
Wally's dumb

1550
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
No

1551
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Preemptive

1552
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,512
No I don't think

1553
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,888
I don't well

1554
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,240
I don't tell me that Leanne

1555
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
I think they dated

1556
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
That that like

1557
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:51,712
There's there's a lot of talk online and they were not going to last interaction is

1558
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:57,088
Really weird around they had a fling or something like that

1559
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:01,184
I'm not defending Alex Jones at all

1560
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,464
In saying this

1561
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
Rat

1562
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
I don't think

1563
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,304
That is his style

1564
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
I don't think

1565
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,864
He's a sexual harasser

1566
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,656
Thought that about Matt

1567
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,728
F****** louder either I would think it more than Alex Jones

1568
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,544
I think that he is probably a harasser

1569
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
But not like a

1570
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:26,272
We yelled at that lady on the street

1571
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,088
Probably

1572
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,416
If somebody comes forward on Alex

1573
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,512
I think I'm pretty well I think the more likely thing is

1574
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,792
Protection for Trump

1575
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Roy Moore

1576
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,888
That's more where his feelings lie

1577
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
And the

1578
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Like

1579
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,264
Motivated for those guys

1580
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,824
Or financially motivated then in the same way

1581
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,104
Be financially motivated

1582
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
For a Roy Moore

1583
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:58,272
Also at the same time the narratives that it's about the contract that feeds into

1584
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,648
Reason

1585
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,232
To be in that camp himself into a strange

1586
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,256
Corner of now.

1587
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
Defending every sex

1588
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,888
Weird it was next clip

1589
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,424
He's unclear whether he's

1590
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Defending Matt Lauer

1591
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,264
It's up and down

1592
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
Top talk show hosts

1593
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
The escapades

1594
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,720
But I don't

1595
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:44,352
So he mostly girls wanted

1596
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,168
As every dude

1597
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,312
He is defending it but he's trying to play that weird fence

1598
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,176
I'm not defending it but everything I'm doing is

1599
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Independence

1600
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:03,808
We know that

1601
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,576
Believe that

1602
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,136
I'm too and in this clip

1603
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,696
He is sort of imagining his current

1604
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
Victory over the globalist

1605
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,864
Now it's the next chapter of his face

1606
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,192
Globalist

1607
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
They're doing now

1608
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
When you see the generals

1609
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:42,720
Loading up on their train and the Run

1610
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,984
Hung in bedroom

1611
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:58,848
People are turning on

1612
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,688
Bosses bosses are

1613
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,480
Cleaning up the bread crumbs

1614
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,600
Kill right now

1615
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,488
Their hands full killing off

1616
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
People that know

1617
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,584
Where the bodies are buried or where the bank accounts are

1618
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,376
Where the landing bases are

1619
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
All over rural areas are building

1620
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
4 heavy aircraft

1621
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
That's been a minute

1622
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,920
Dial Chad

1623
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,480
Global cover-up Fuller Beach

1624
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,272
Killed who have the

1625
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,576
Good political

1626
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,136
But be that as it may it's like

1627
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
Alex

1628
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
You're crazy

1629
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,744
But

1630
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
If you want

1631
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,864
I'm crazy this dance my friend

1632
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,144
If you want to do that

1633
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
You need

1634
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
Information

1635
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
Half of your name

1636
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
You have

1637
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,872
Info is short for information

1638
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,944
Entirely

1639
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,760
I think you've lost your mind

1640
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
Killed

1641
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
All around

1642
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
Frank separate

1643
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,512
Frank from down the way

1644
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,072
Sapphire

1645
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
No go zones

1646
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,168
Soros operative took him down do you know why

1647
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
He had a

1648
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
Information on

1649
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,752
Frankie J

1650
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,848
Deer River no-go Zone snow cone

1651
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
Really good

1652
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,688
Anyway

1653
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,344
I got to logos a no-go Zone

1654
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,928
Tommy Davidson

1655
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,464
Anyway

1656
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,840
Most idiotic moronic people

1657
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,144
Are going along with this

1658
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
Because

1659
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,728
Getting a royal title

1660
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,360
Someone was bad

1661
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,944
Drooling

1662
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Okay

1663
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
Well first off Dan

1664
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Someone has

1665
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
So you made

1666
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,160
Alright Malaysia

1667
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Lord I haven't

1668
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
Assaulted

1669
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,024
Umaid bhawan milord

1670
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:32,960
Irony there the projection is is like 3/4 of the show isn't talking about people treating a bad guy

1671
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,496
Cuz he's white

1672
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,544
Don't I mean

1673
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Okay

1674
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,616
The difference between

1675
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
Minorities

1676
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
Women

1677
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,712
Speaking up for themselves

1678
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
I'm trying to adjust

1679
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:50,624
The social hierarchy that

1680
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,648
And Alex Jones

1681
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
Creating

1682
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Tire world

1683
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,976
View that involves

1684
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Metal poisoning of the water in

1685
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Destruction of

1686
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Christian

1687
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,608
Christendom system

1688
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,656
The way to a

1689
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,680
Tack White

1690
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,216
People

1691
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,240
Different

1692
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,568
It goes back to what I was trying to get you with the feminist baby

1693
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
Do you think it's like

1694
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
You

1695
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,920
People post memes and then laugh

1696
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,552
Because you saw a feminist baby book

1697
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
And you

1698
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,624
This is like a little bit

1699
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,024
Hire like 15 minutes about it on your movie now we need to write this baby

1700
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,888
Except which Alex Jones is like

1701
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,472
I've been wrong racially is on

1702
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:41,056
Entirely different level then

1703
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,640
27

1704
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,992
That's not dream Dreamworks is the way to go

1705
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
I just don't know

1706
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,112
I don't understand how he doesn't have the

1707
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,160
Going to be like wait I do that all the time

1708
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
The entirety

1709
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,096
Like you don't we go back to this

1710
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,144
Hypocrisy is a feature

1711
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
It is not a

1712
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
Bug of there

1713
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
World

1714
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,520
I don't disagree

1715
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
Hip-hop

1716
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,080
Christian

1717
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,152
Point of view is something that they Revel in

1718
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,480
They want every

1719
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:23,040
If you are a white person who want special treatment

1720
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
For white

1721
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,856
The only way you can

1722
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
I can deal with that

1723
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,392
Is by Turner

1724
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,696
Into urine

1725
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,816
Distance until logic

1726
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
Preferential

1727
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,608
Treatment

1728
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
The same time saying

1729
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
That everybody should

1730
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
Percy is all you can

1731
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Turn to

1732
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
As a mode of thought

1733
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
And so

1734
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
That's

1735
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
That's our goal

1736
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,408
Make hypocrisy so normal

1737
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,432
Help but

1738
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
I'm just Passover

1739
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,832
You pointing that out.

1740
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
Just now is something that

1741
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,904
That we're all still like

1742
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
You can't do that

1743
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
Everything

1744
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,072
To some extent it is like the.

1745
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
It is

1746
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
The same thing as the Ice Bowl

1747
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:15,008
It's more just like that this is this is the reality of how he operates

1748
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
I'm not like

1749
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,128
Can you believe you such a hypocrite cuz we do know that game doesn't work

1750
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
More like

1751
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,944
Here's a journal of his b*******

1752
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,736
Well you take

1753
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,760
Take a look at

1754
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
The progressives

1755
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
Versus

1756
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,904
If you want to talk about Hip Hop

1757
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,720
Simply look at the way that we're dealing with sex

1758
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,304
Progressives are currently having a

1759
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Purge

1760
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:42,656
And it's probably not enough and it's not aggressive enough like

1761
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,216
It's very high-profile but the mid-level guy

1762
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,240
Not bad

1763
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,312
Considering how bad it's been in the past

1764
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,384
Cold comfort to some extent

1765
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,152
F******

1766
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,456
Doing it and we're all wrestling

1767
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,272
Like there's no amount of there's no

1768
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Feel but you can

1769
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,856
Can be in now except maybe like electrical engine

1770
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Where am I

1771
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:08,512
Maybe we're already bisexual

1772
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,840
Like we were hanging out

1773
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Reflection

1774
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
Hopefully

1775
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:20,032
Dealing with the underlying issue

1776
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,312
And it sucks

1777
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,616
But if you want to have some comfort

1778
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,896
About Alex Jones and

1779
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
Hypocrisy

1780
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
And all that stuff

1781
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
What have you

1782
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
He

1783
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,832
Knows that his listeners

1784
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
He's aware

1785
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,184
And the very least

1786
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,488
This next clip kind of indicates.

1787
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
To me that he is

1788
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
He gets it

1789
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
Should I love

1790
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,704
We're at the best Scholars loras College, Paradise

1791
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,496
Jumbo cilantro bit of sleep

1792
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,336
Flash

1793
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,128
Your phone calls

1794
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,456
Bittersweet

1795
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,224
Certainly

1796
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Certainly

1797
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:05,344
I think it's always been you trying to say

1798
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,880
Somehow we're going to be real bad

1799
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:13,536
Pretty sure that's what he was saying there Alex

1800
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Pretty bad

1801
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:19,424
Not as bad as I want to talk about

1802
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,216
Here's one of the calls

1803
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,544
The lady wants to get into talking about how I

1804
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,640
They're always a choice

1805
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,944
Are you with God are you with Satan

1806
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,576
I'll let you think it over

1807
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,904
And you have to pick a side

1808
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,488
You're either going to pick up five you're going to pick things by

1809
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
And I picked

1810
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Christ

1811
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:58,080
Metaphysical

1812
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:02,944
We know that so much

1813
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,224
With all these things happening

1814
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,040
Our spirits

1815
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,600
Broadcasting

1816
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,704
I think this rhetoric I just want to pause we're going to get through the rest of the clip but I just think this rhetoric

1817
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:25,984
Super f****** day

1818
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
I think of this

1819
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,824
Never trust anybody who knows anything

1820
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:35,200
Ever always go with the guy and the Bible

1821
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,504
But a lot harder

1822
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,040
Also like

1823
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:39,808
Look

1824
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,600
God is the only thing that's important

1825
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,672
Christianity is under attack but also

1826
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
Can't be trusted

1827
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:46,976
Bucked up

1828
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,448
Most these churches aren't real churches and that's really the big threat

1829
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
There's no way

1830
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
Up against Islam

1831
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
What's halfway in the Poland

1832
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,136
A tornado

1833
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,208
What wrong baby Toys R Us

1834
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:22,560
Call large print

1835
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,888
I know they're a lot of nice Muslim before Muslim

1836
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,216
I love when people say I don't want to

1837
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
Bright

1838
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
Just

1839
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,664
You hate Muslims against your will still hate Muslims in your

1840
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,456
It doesn't suggest it

1841
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
It requires

1842
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:46,368
I don't want to light

1843
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,928
Right I don't want to I want to be a better person

1844
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,512
You're making me

1845
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:58,400
That makes perfect sense a tweeted this earlier today when I heard this

1846
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
It's just

1847
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
That

1848
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,264
He says stuff like that

1849
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,800
Has no qualms with like

1850
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,104
It's cool with that

1851
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,432
I don't want to hate Muslims

1852
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,456
Is first of all like

1853
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
Cowardly

1854
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,552
Because you're trying to make yourself seem like a good person

1855
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
Within your bigoted

1856
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,904
But it's also admitting straight up

1857
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
The bigotry

1858
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
And that's

1859
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,536
You would host making this up text

1860
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,072
You would hope that your audience

1861
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Would be like

1862
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Dude

1863
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
But they talk

1864
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:35,008
Is there on the same page about 10 million

1865
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,824
Permission

1866
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,616
To be on the same page

1867
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,688
Now admittedly we do too but that's just on the list

1868
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
The things that you find raised

1869
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:49,088
Oswalt donkey growing out

1870
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
In the 1180

1871
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
That's correct

1872
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
The only thing that Alex Jones

1873
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,256
Bambi talking about is

1874
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
The expansion.

1875
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
The arrow

1876
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,096
Armies did

1877
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,144
Persian armies did in the

1878
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
X700

1879
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,960
What does pre Crusades by

1880
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
Century

1881
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,288
Or the play Othello we already talked

1882
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,848
Like we did so

1883
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
Pointless to talk about but

1884
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,432
The nature of Empire

1885
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Back then

1886
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
We're such

1887
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
Like

1888
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,784
Alexander the Great

1889
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
Genghis Khan

1890
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,672
All sorts of people throughout Rome in Greece

1891
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
They invaded Neighbors

1892
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,048
And not to the extent of just like

1893
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:35,168
You stayed in your your geographical area like he's trying to draw some line that like

1894
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,472
The Arabs are the Muslims back then

1895
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:42,080
Yeah he went into Europe with their own places

1896
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,944
No one respected those batteries cuz of batteries didn't exist back then

1897
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,272
Afraid that wasn't

1898
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Poland

1899
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,648
This is complete nonsense

1900
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,976
Even if you go back to it and talk about

1901
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Empire culture

1902
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,840
Call it every

1903
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Part of that

1904
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,888
Was any of this

1905
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
Empires

1906
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
Demolish

1907
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
The cultures

1908
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,288
Usually

1909
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:17,408
Zorbs successful as it was his children would become

1910
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,968
Parts of the the cultures that they

1911
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Took over

1912
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,784
I didn't tear them in such a way

1913
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
Have to worry about uprising

1914
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,880
Nearly as much

1915
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,672
Successors fail

1916
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,720
Cuz they said they did not do that

1917
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,256
Because they once again

1918
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
Took advantage of this idea of

1919
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
Their identity

1920
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
Simple

1921
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,472
Because their lunatic dad raped and murdered his way around Mongolia

1922
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,288
Like when you go to Rome

1923
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
Rome was

1924
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,872
Everywhere Rome went

1925
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,688
Like they first on never set

1926
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:54,272
Only you

1927
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:57,600
No the dino I know

1928
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
But it was

1929
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,232
The point being like the first of the

1930
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,536
First wave of Roman conqueror

1931
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,584
Would go into a place

1932
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Say these people

1933
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:13,216
And then the next Generation they were like all of these people are Roman

1934
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Very simple

1935
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,032
Everyday Direct

1936
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,592
0121 situation

1937
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:21,408
And that's why it lasted far longer than the American

1938
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
Believe that we're Americans

1939
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Geographic

1940
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
MN murder

1941
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:32,160
Sunnyway ilex has a lot of a historical ideas

1942
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,440
About all this

1943
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,048
See where the rest of this club takes us

1944
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,800
And they're using it and it's

1945
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Thank you

1946
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,928
We do not match

1947
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:13,888
I'll give you that one that one was a bad that wasn't a harsh add pivot of like I'm going to kill everybody

1948
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912
They also we're going to be

1949
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,752
But it was like a

1950
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:25,152
Hey we're going to get to you and you and you and then we're going to

1951
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,552
You seem to forget because we had that conversation that the beginning of that clip was him never fall to Islam

1952
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:37,952
Because of

1953
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
When we broke in that clip

1954
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,304
A little bit.

1955
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,632
Alright generally he goes from yelling to

1956
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:51,008
Hard pivot right

1957
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
Comes back

1958
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:52,800
Another bit of

1959
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,456
Local affiliates become a sponsor

1960
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,248
Cinema 123

1961
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
Billboard

1962
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
To the truth

1963
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,672
America organizations that are pro Christian

1964
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,376
Sharon

1965
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Your church

1966
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,448
They can make no law respecting

1967
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,152
Cheer up

1968
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,672
Solid

1969
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:44,000
I was looking through the Bible tithe

1970
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:44,768
To the church

1971
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:47,328
Pocket God

1972
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,864
You tithe

1973
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:52,960
To Infowars by friend Bible verses

1974
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Is that

1975
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
Involve tithing

1976
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,800
Pretty universally there about give

1977
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,664
Alex is really really close

1978
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
To like

1979
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,200
This is

1980
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
Colts.

1981
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,272
Like what he's doing

1982
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,808
Is framing himself

1983
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,856
Essentially as a defender of Chris

1984
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,392
Right

1985
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,208
He's in a dangerous territory in terms of like

1986
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,744
Classifying himself as a

1987
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Journalist

1988
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,560
When will use really operating as a

1989
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:22,656
Occult okpoko of giving 10% of your income

1990
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,192
You get weird pills in return

1991
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,216
Dusa is

1992
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
Noosa

1993
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,544
Alex is going elrond

1994
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,616
Alex is going for full text

1995
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
Exemption

1996
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
He has written

1997
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,456
The book Galaxy

1998
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,528
I think that's what he's going to try and accidentally

1999
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:45,952
Like what do you think do you think elran had a plan he was a writer who is just

2000
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:52,352
Scared all the time and running and eventually he stumbled upon the idea of like a what

2001
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,400
This way because I don't want

2002
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,192
Taxes on my ship books

2003
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,752
I think he had more of a plan that Alex has

2004
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,520
In that

2005
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,592
Regard although of course Alex doesn't believe you

2006
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,640
Taxes we know that

2007
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,176
How do you get out of

2008
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,712
Search religion

2009
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,760
Alex Jones

2010
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
2

2011
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Hard to make the

2012
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:18,208
The transition I was a nympho Warrior now I'm a nympho worship

2013
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,792
Warriors marching

2014
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,328
Door

2015
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,144
Just weird I don't really

2016
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,168
Even know what's going on

2017
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,192
That or had a

2018
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,712
And and do Christians for that that is

2019
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:44,832
George Soros

2020
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
So

2021
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,624
Wait

2022
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,904
I don't understand

2023
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,184
I don't really either

2024
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,744
So didn't he just reveal that it's

2025
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,280
Fine

2026
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,864
Letting you giving preferential

2027
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
Treatment to the atrocities

2028
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,424
Christians committed as

2029
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,960
Opposed as opposed

2030
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
2

2031
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
I would be

2032
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,776
I like to be perfectly

2033
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,824
I didn't care about that LMAO

2034
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
I care more about his

2035
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,152
Contextualizing

2036
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
MS-13 is a

2037
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,224
Christian Gehring

2038
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,504
Oh no that's because

2039
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:19,136
I don't want to I don't want to talk about them quite frankly at the same time there are more important elements

2040
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,672
Operation then

2041
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Christianity

2042
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
Necessarily

2043
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:27,328
I'm sure there's more important

2044
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,144
So the idea that he's

2045
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
Repairing that

2046
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
To like

2047
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,472
Analog of

2048
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Isis I guess

2049
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,848
Yeah is weird but it also belies

2050
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
Reality

2051
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,176
And that is that Isis

2052
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
Isn't Street

2053
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,224
Prickly motivated by

2054
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,528
Islam or religious ideology

2055
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
Okay there is

2056
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,368
And not to save it

2057
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,440
Or false

2058
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,768
There are geopolitical realities and consequences of actions

2059
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
That we've taken in the

2060
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Exploiting

2061
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,096
Population

2062
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,912
Killing civilians

2063
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,984
Right and that is a piece of it and whether it's

2064
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,008
By Islam

2065
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:12,128
Also informed by Islam all of that can be true

2066
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,408
But there's more to it

2067
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,272
Gank leads me to believe that he

2068
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,296
He has somewhere

2069
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,088
That the religious

2070
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,880
Aspect of various groups

2071
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,928
Isn't necessarily all there is

2072
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,720
And I also

2073
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Say that because

2074
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,768
I don't think that

2075
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
I don't think that MS-13

2076
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
Bingos around

2077
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:35,168
Christianity on that one but be that as it may

2078
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,216
The idea that is

2079
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
888

2080
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,336
I mean not even

2081
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:46,176
To go the weirdest thing ever

2082
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,224
I would say there's no Isis

2083
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
Without

2084
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
The Iraq War

2085
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:53,344
There's no Iraq without

2086
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,880
Me to call Joe

2087
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,184
And there's no cold war without

2088
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:02,048
The CIA back to overthrow of the liberal Regina midnight

2089
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,072
In Iran

2090
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:07,424
Like I would Isis began whenever America was like

2091
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,984
You guys are really doing great

2092
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,776
How about a religious the app

2093
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
Cuz they're going to pay us

2094
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,872
Right

2095
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
Realistically probably

2096
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,456
Further back

2097
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:24,576
Whenever the Muslim started the slave trade

2098
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
It is just

2099
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
Short-sighted to a certain extent

2100
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Is blame game

2101
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,792
Yeah but that's the that's the way that you deal with foreign policy in order to

2102
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Foreign policy

2103
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,168
In order to evade the fact that

2104
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,192
It's such a car

2105
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Complicated

2106
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,240
That there's no

2107
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,520
Like nice

2108
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
Through butter solution

2109
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:48,896
There's so many actors involved in all of them have different motivations

2110
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
Very difficult

2111
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,224
Get all of them what they're looking

2112
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,528
Anybody with rosin

2113
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,296
Anything is go

2114
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
Chaos

2115
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,624
It's going to push everybody else

2116
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,184
The amount of resources

2117
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
We have in the world are enough to

2118
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,024
Much larger population

2119
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
We even have no help

2120
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,120
The issue becomes

2121
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
When you have

2122
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
Population

2123
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
Besides that we have with differ

2124
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Nations

2125
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Different places they oliverius

2126
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,312
Distribution

2127
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,336
News of the resource

2128
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
You could have everyone living

2129
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,200
Utopia 2

2130
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,760
If everyone saw it as

2131
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,320
Non zero-sum game

2132
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:31,136
If the your loss didn't mean I win

2133
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
You can have

2134
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
Very compassionate

2135
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,232
System in the world where

2136
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,512
Let's say Bangladesh

2137
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,304
There's a lot of people who live there and it's

2138
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
It's impossible for them to survive

2139
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
Because

2140
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
The floodplain

2141
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,192
The inability of them to that

2142
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Based on

2143
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,240
The soil

2144
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
To grow crops

2145
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,288
To sustain the population

2146
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,336
If we looked at that we're like

2147
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,128
We should send them food

2148
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
We should just do that we should

2149
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:57,760
Azan world we have excess food around we should send them

2150
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
Food

2151
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,320
If we lived in that system

2152
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,600
You could take care of places

2153
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,392
Is like that but as soon as you can

2154
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,672
Introduce anybody who treat

2155
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,464
As a zero-sum game

2156
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,744
The whole thing gets

2157
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,304
Yep because then you end up with

2158
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,072
People who are

2159
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,144
In Bangladesh website

2160
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
Oh there's a

2161
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,704
The ton of food, then everyone could

2162
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,752
Could survive or I could be a king

2163
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:21,568
And that it becomes a zero-sum game where I have to

2164
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,848
To steal your resources

2165
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
In order to

2166
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,896
Better myself

2167
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
Right and that's where we get socks

2168
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,456
No system

2169
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,736
Can exist where

2170
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,320
Can successfully exist

2171
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
Where

2172
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:35,392
People have a different version of what game is

2173
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
That sucks

2174
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
It's a

2175
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,280
It's a stranger explanation

2176
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
2

2177
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Think by

2178
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:47,936
I think are psychopaths that are serial killers

2179
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,752
Are the same thing as our

2180
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,056
Not far off

2181
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,592
Like I think that's kind of

2182
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,640
I think that's kind of

2183
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
Wrenched

2184
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,176
It's been thrown in

2185
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,968
Humanity is always

2186
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
Eventually

2187
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
Somebody gets enough

2188
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,064
Become divorce

2189
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,344
From their own

2190
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,392
Action to everybody else

2191
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,440
Sprint in which case may isolates

2192
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,464
Themselves creating a

2193
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,744
A self-reinforcing

2194
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,512
Narrative

2195
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,536
And then

2196
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,376
There we go like every friend ever

2197
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
System

2198
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,424
Has eventually

2199
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,448
Been over

2200
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Taken by back

2201
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,008
Every single time

2202
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,056
Like maybe yumanity

2203
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,848
He just needs to die out and

2204
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,384
Squirrels will become

2205
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,432
Ultimate survivors

2206
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,480
Great squirrel I'm rooting for

2207
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,248
I'm actually

2208
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,272
Rooting for orchids

2209
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,808
I saw an albino

2210
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,576
Scroll on time

2211
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,856
Really cool

2212
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,880
That's amazing

2213
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,440
I imagine

2214
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,280
Cool they're too cool

2215
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
Explains for

2216
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,840
More less

2217
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,912
F***** up monologue

2218
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,216
But I'm certain was cut out of the rebroadcast

2219
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,520
Because I can now record these live

2220
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
I got

2221
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
This is

2222
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Bucked up

2223
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:06,016
The Bubble Witch great error

2224
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:12,416
Alaskan Malamute

2225
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:18,816
Miles above

2226
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
The fuc

2227
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:23,168
We're miles above them on our journey to hell

2228
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:23,936
Hell

2229
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,728
Not what the f*** is he

2230
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:31,104
Perfect but we're like riding them

2231
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:38,016
Would you rather be the horse or the guy riding

2232
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:44,416
That does not match up with his worldview anyway we opposed

2233
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,184
World you that like

2234
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:51,328
The globalist we're coming down fast on you as we all rocket to hell what the f*** is he saying

2235
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:58,752
Wanted to do a cool monologue / Helter Skelter

2236
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:04,384
I'll see you in hell but he's kind of like

2237
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,432
AutoZone

2238
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:10,528
I like the person not bad

2239
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,856
If you saw that no Western pretty badass.

2240
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:17,696
Different person I enjoy.

2241
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,000
Another narrative

2242
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,048
He's pitching

2243
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
Bridges said that his gravelly voice

2244
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:31,008
And I'll give you the broad Strokes

2245
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,568
There is a measure of

2246
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,640
In Philadelphia that would involve takedown

2247
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,664
Bulletproof glass

2248
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,712
And Bodega

2249
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,992
Stores in

2250
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:43,808
Interesting

2251
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:48,416
I don't know anything about that and let me Morty let me tell you

2252
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,464
That's the only information

2253
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,488
Gibbs on the

2254
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,792
Okay now it's listening

2255
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:58,912
Give it take on it and then I will explain what the actual score today

2256
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,448
Never been more like

2257
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,776
I don't have an instant take I got no idea what

2258
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,104
Bad life because yeah it's one of those

2259
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,408
I know the convenience stores do get robbed

2260
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,456
Yeah I know

2261
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,760
Like it would be on

2262
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,784
Making Rudy

2263
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,832
Until he realizes that

2264
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
Good lying but every

2265
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,792
New York Chicago

2266
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
Philadelphia

2267
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,840
Delish donut

2268
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:34,496
Draconian gun build

2269
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:40,384
Plexiglass

2270
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:49,088
It's your fault

2271
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,952
Set timer at

2272
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,488
Racist Democrat woman

2273
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:17,760
Self

2274
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:18,784
What do you think

2275
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:27,744
I want to go on the same hypocrisy rent from earlier but my God

2276
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,328
I'm complaining about other people bitching

2277
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,144
I can't

2278
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,472
It's pretty wild also what was he complaining about

2279
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:43,360
Grabbing and I don't remember the Liberals want you to get

2280
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
He's presenting it is but there are these

2281
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,736
Do you know stores

2282
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,272
In bad areas of town

2283
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,576
I am. They argue no

2284
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,368
They're taking the risk and

2285
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,160
Commerce it's bad areas

2286
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:58,720
And this pic. Bulletproof glass

2287
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,512
The incentive eyes them having

2288
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,584
These businesses in places where there would be no business otherwise

2289
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,120
He's basically trying to

2290
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,912
Complain I think about food desert

2291
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,704
But at the same time

2292
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,008
Bread and screaming about all sorts of other stuff

2293
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
Naturally

2294
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,824
Now as is his want

2295
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,872
He's wrong about this

2296
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
A.m.

2297
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,040
Shockingly I'm going to read to you from ABC6

2298
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:23,808
In Philadelphia

2299
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:30,720
Governor Tom Wolf was in Philadelphia on Thursday to sign a bill that would enforce stricter penalties on so-called

2300
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,256
Stop-and-go stores

2301
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,536
That break the law

2302
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:36,352
Lawmakers say that these alcohol established

2303
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,376
To become a nuisance

2304
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,936
Some of the stores advertised

2305
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:45,056
Cheesesteaks actually just sell beer in shots of alcohol to go

2306
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
We went to one such

2307
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,384
Serving food at all

2308
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:51,200
When we asked why we were told quote The Kooks

2309
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
Not here yet

2310
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:56,832
Lovett an undercover Action News investigation for the liquor store right now

2311
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,624
An undercover Action News investigate

2312
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,928
Most of the shops operate using a

2313
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:01,952
Restaurant life

2314
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,000
Spell little besides booze

2315
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,816
We're not cooking today one shop owner said

2316
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,352
When asked why he said

2317
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,376
We don't feel like

2318
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:13,984
Couple love love with

2319
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:18,592

Burton Public Schools sometimes right next

2321
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:23,456
Clearly this is less than 500 ft

2322
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
Freeman Elementary School

2323
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
She said it once

2324
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:29,856
Many of these stop-and-go bars also sell candy for kids right alongside

2325
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,624
Intoxicated

2326
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,904
Customer

2327
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,208
You'll have children in line to buy candy at the

2328
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,512
The same time you have adults in line to buy shots of alcohol

2329
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,632
Street they're supposed to meet minimum requirement

2330
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:44,448
Including food and access to bathroom

2331
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,264
Quote they have no place to go to the bathroom

2332
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,056
Drum so they're doing it all over the street

2333

Pizza resident janebar

01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,128
Lesson lesson that

2335
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,688
Are we ain't use the bathroom

2336
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,480

Jeremiah Thomas

You other option

2343
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
Been wandering neighborhood streets while they drink

2344
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,768
All right now I'm seeing the danger

2345
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:13,376
Quote we had retired violation after violation after violation in many of these

2346
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:14,912
Said representative Jordan Hare

2347
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,960
He was a Powerhouse behind the legend

2348
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,240
Inflation that was signed by what

2349
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:22,592
Give the liquor control board more authority to shut down bad Act

2350
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,640
Quote nobody should have to

2351
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,664

2353

The Titan the city's requirements

2354
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,296
To get a liquor

2355
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,832
Call Neighborhood

2356
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:33,856
Should not feel like they're being

2357
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,624
Held hostage

2358
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,392
Bad business

2359
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,208
So the issue at hand with

2360
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,488
The plexiglass

2361
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,768
And the bullet proof glass

2362
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
Is

2363
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,072
That

2364
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,352
These organizations

2365
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
The stop-and-go shop

2366
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,680
They're exploiting a loophole

2367
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,216
In the liquor lights

2368
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:51,520
We're in instead of selling package

2369
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
Liquor

2370
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,824
What they're doing is there for

2371
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,104
Pretending to a restaurant

2372
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,408
Adventures Tavor 7

2373
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:03,808
It what they do is they have all their stuff behind bulletproof glass worth technically we have seating for 30

2374
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:08,160
People just no one's allowed to sit down and do is create

2375
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,464
A more sensible way to

2376
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
To be like okay you don't have this life

2377
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,304
Because that is danger

2378
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,328
I disagree

2379
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,680
In that it is

2380
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,728
I disagree with this law and I think it's

2381
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:27,872
Stupid I think I think what they're doing I'm on the fence about it but I want to be totally clear that the way Alex

2382
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,896
Is presenting it is a lie

2383
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,736
Because

2384
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,016
I think it would be really fun

2385
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,832
To go stop somewhere and get a shot

2386
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:40,928
But it's like why do you got to hone something great guys

2387
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
I have a bathroom

2388
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,048
But here's the real issue

2389
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,120
Here's the real here's the real issue

2390
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:52,192
AR criminalizing

2391
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Once again

2392
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,288
That's what that I disagree

2393
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
You're not

2394
01:55:57,312 --> 01:56:01,152
Dealing with the reality of the reason that those places show up

2395
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:05,760
Do you see those places in a white affluent f****** neighborhood

2396
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:10,112
Corsage

2397
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,672
It's like every time cancer metastasized

2398
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,952
You just like

2399
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,768
Flick a little a new little cancer

2400
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,072
Bulshit they're not

2401
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,120
Dealing with the actual underlying issue

2402
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:21,888
Totally

2403
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:25,728
Total might be a good way to be

2404
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
Begin

2405
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,776
Dealing with it

2406
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
I agree with you

2407
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,152
At the same time I get it

2408
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:35,968
From the legislative perspective

2409
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:37,760
Joan

2410
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Stitch onesie

2411
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,320
Specially nearest school

2412
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,368
You don't want open Boos

2413
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:45,440
And a place where you can just stop in and buy shots

2414
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:47,232
Associate

2415
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,512
Agree that

2416
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:53,632
Giving giving the liquor board the authority to not give that sort of license

2417
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,656
To those places

2418
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:55,936
Make sense

2419
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
Then they should

2420
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,032
Live up to be

2421
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,312
You have a bathroom

2422
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:04,384
You have a place people can sit down like a bar cuz

2423
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:10,016
You're acting like a bar but you're conveniently having all the other stuff taken away from it

2424
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,296
I agree if you want hun

2425
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,368
In a vacuum

2426
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,648
Sensible solution

2427
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:19,744
Right in reality what you're doing is playing

2428
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:22,048
Fair enough

2429
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:28,448
This complaint was no I left Alex behind a million years ago

2430
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:30,496
What is a f****** talk

2431
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:35,360
No information but like if it was

2432
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,128
Complaint then

2433
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:39,200
The show be a lot more interesting

2434
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,528
Because I think we can agree to some extent that like

2435
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,064
All right there other issues

2436
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
The play that are more important

2437
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,112
But

2438
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:49,184
That's why I still support the legislation

2439
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:56,096
I actually might disagree with you there I don't I'm not sure about that yet cuz I don't know that

2440
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,192
But I think this ultimately comes back to my argument

2441
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:02,496
Giving a s*** about what conserve

2442
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,800
Because in this

2443
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,824
Right

2444
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:07,360
If we

2445
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,408
Alex and I started from the bases

2446
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
Is of like

2447
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:12,224
Okay this is a problem

2448
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:15,040
We know what the real problem is

2449
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,320
The question is

2450
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,344
How do we solve

2451
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,904
Is the US the conservative answer

2452
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,440
As we solve this by

2453
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,720
Changing this Paula

2454
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,256
And rewriting this

2455
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:27,840
But my answer is well we solve it by doing this

2456
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,632
We can talk about

2457
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
2 agreements

2458
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
Right

2459
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,472
If his response to this

2460
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,752
Is

2461
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,080
They're trying to make sure everybody gets murdered

2462
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,640
Yeah there's no conversation to be had the

2463
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:47,040
There needs to be disregarded and tossed aside

2464
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:51,136
Another article that I read

2465
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,928
Proposed legislation

2466
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:55,232
Really feel bad that I don't ever named pulled up but

2467
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,584
The issue that she brings up is like

2468
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:03,424
I understand would think that this would have a negative impact on

2469
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,960
Security but you have to

2470
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,752
Understand that there are

2471
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:07,520
And restaurant

2472
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,312
In bad areas

2473
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,848
Don't

2474
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,872
Shoes with

2475
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,896
Employees being assaulted

2476
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,176
Airways

2477
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:15,968
Courage

2478
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
Better customer Behavior

2479
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,064
Rarity cameras

2480
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,600
50 then we get back

2481
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:24,160
To your trying to legislate poor people

2482
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:24,928
Whose Behavior

2483
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,744
Without dealing with the problem which is

2484
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,768
Courtright

2485
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:33,376
You f*** them up and you polish them behind much bigger issue but in the meantime

2486
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:37,216
It's not legislating poor people's behavior to legislate

2487
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Waze

2488
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Do not have

2489
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:39,776
Have people get assaulted

2490
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,568
Bike

2491
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,592
Legislating

2492
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,128
Against violence

2493
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,920
Prime isn't necessarily

2494
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,480
The reasonable argument that we should have about

2495
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:53,856
Four people right

2496
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,792
It is something that I do I do

2497
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:02,560
Sink is

2498
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,584
Is

2499
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:07,424
Indicative of my issue with every like

2500
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:10,752
Do Trump voters thinks differently about Trump right now

2501
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:14,336
I don't care they mean nothing until they understand what the problem

2502
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:16,640
Until then f****** go away

2503
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:19,456
Right the bottom line where you can find agreement

2504
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,480
Is that

2505
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:22,784
Alex is wrong

2506
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
Alex

2507
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,368
Anime

2508
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:29,696
Alex is so wrong I started talking about

2509
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,720
A different problem

2510
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
Right

2511
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,864
We only got a couple more Clips here and Alex's time on the broadcast

2512
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
Like I said

2513
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:44,544
He has an interview with Lucy or whatever the f***

2514
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:50,688
Is a writer for Gateway pundit who recently had a video that went viral on the internet

2515
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:51,968
He was giving a speech

2516
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:54,784
University of Yale maybe I don't know

2517
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,344
Okay

2518
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,184
I we don't want you here

2519
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:07,584
Rather than Christmas speech was titled it's okay to be white

2520
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,912
The lady came out

2521
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,448
At the podium

2522
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,984
She took his notes

2523
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:16,032
Yeah

2524
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,312
Or less

2525
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:18,848
Couldn't understand

2526
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
This was basketball

2527
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,480
He's going for the ball

2528
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:30,880
It's okay alright it's a flagrant-1 not a flagrant

2529
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,488
Maybe not passing her fear

2530
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,840
But he the way he treated

2531
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:41,376
The way he treated her

2532
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,656
Was not

2533
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,448
I just want my stuff

2534
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,032
It was absolutely an aggressive violent

2535
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,408
Like in a way that I think everyone can

2536
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,176
Agree

2537
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,456
Even though

2538
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:56,992
She did take his

2539
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,272
I agree with that

2540
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
That is true

2541
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,576
You got me right in the video

2542
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:03,136
His behavior is absolutely on

2543
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:06,976
Especially considering that there was a security guard

2544
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:08,256
Stop right there

2545
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:10,304
Said she took my notes

2546
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:12,608
Give me back my note

2547
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:15,168
She acted like a child and he acted like a

2548
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,960
Violent monster

2549
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:21,824
So he has Alex has him on the show to talk about how the left is crazy

2550
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,360
Here's Alex

2551
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
Think I want to hear it

2552
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:28,224
Dot-com

2553
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:33,088
I feel this enforceable

2554
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:35,904
Video game with audio for folks

2555
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:42,304
You have been robbed under common law and local Island

2556
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,496
Physically

2557
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:07,136
This is Liberty this is libertarian ship

2558
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,440
This is libertarian ship

2559
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:13,280
I said earlier that there was

2560
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:19,680
Security guard there who could have easily display escalated the situation and gotten him is no

2561
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
Notes back yeah

2562
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,728
Libertarian

2563
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,496
I believe

2564
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,520
That it's wrong

2565
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:27,104
The police has a monopoly on Force

2566
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,688
Yeah or whatever they don't believe that Authority needs to

2567
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:35,552
She took my stuff under common-law I can attack her and Redwood have you it's just

2568
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
Nonsense well just

2569
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,112
What is work

2570
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,904
Is like

2571
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:47,072
Under the law you didn't punch her you didn't hit her

2572
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,936
Write like it no you can

2573
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,472
It's not just

2574
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,752
Punch and hit

2575
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,288
Like there's a hole

2576
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:58,080
Like if you put her in a headlock

2577
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:02,432
What does physically assault

2578
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:05,248
Still set a reminder

2579
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,272
Strictly speaking

2580
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:07,040
You shouldn't have taken

2581
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:10,624
That's not right either but in the grand scheme

2582
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,648
The idea of taking

2583
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,184
OneNote

2584
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:17,536
Someone I think there's a hierarchy there

2585
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:21,120
A bunch of bulshit about how Liberals are stupid

2586
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,680
Substandard stuff

2587
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,448
Then

2588
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:27,264
Lucy whatever is f****** name is

2589
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,824
Says something famous Lucia

2590
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,104
Yeah Winthrop

2591
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:38,016
Whitest name that's why it's okay to be white

2592
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,808
Malfoy

2593
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:44,416
Lucius Malfoy

2594
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:48,512
So here is something that is

2595
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:52,608
Borders on you couldn't be robber

2596
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:54,144
If your name was Lucy In You

2597
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,960
So listen to Lucy

2598
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,520
You could not be further from

2599
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,288
OnPoint

2600
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:27,424
That's why

2601
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:36,896
That's such a fun narrative you know what I mean

2602
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,176
Everytime I come

2603
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:41,248
Cast my real fear

2604
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:46,112
Do you know what they're what we joked about that for like two episodes

2605
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,976
I'm scared I'm scared that the more I listen to Alex the more I'm going to come to him

2606
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:53,536
I want to see though that

2607
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:55,072
What underpins

2608
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:55,840
What are you talkin about

2609
02:05:56,352 --> 02:06:00,448
True it invent I do worry about people hearing these things

2610
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,752
Being overwhelmed with the emotional appeal

2611
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
Heels that are in

2612
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:09,920
The idea of white fear the idea of all these things that Christian figure that Alex espouses

2613
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,480
I do worry about people being swayed by those things

2614
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
The content

2615
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,064
That is why I am

2616
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,856
I'm opposed to the it's not that like

2617
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:21,184
I'm worried that you guys are so logical that I can't

2618
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:23,488
Deconstruct whatever it is you're lying

2619
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:25,280
It's

2620
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,816
It's the lamest

2621
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:29,888
Best f****** thing ever it is it's the way cernovich operate

2622
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,960
It's all these dudes vapor

2623
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:35,520
You know what it is it's Brandon

2624
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:37,056
It's branding of logic

2625
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,872
Branding of facts

2626
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:44,224
You guys operate Automotion exactly right screw

2627
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,040
Every time they talk about a

2628
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Google campaign

2629
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,088
Insofar as

2630
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,904
Oh there's going to be 40% who's on the left

2631
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:55,232
Going to be 40% on the right and your job is to figure out the

2632
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,000
The 10%

2633
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,024
20 /

2634
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:00,864
Yeah and the right has done something

2635
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,912
Way smarter than what we have

2636
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,216
And they realize that the middle

2637
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,752
Doesn't mean any

2638
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,568
What they're going for is the

2639
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:16,480
Yeah so when we talk about

2640
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:21,856
Not of people on the left responding to this s*** if you're on the left you f******

2641
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,392
Get most of it at least

2642
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:26,208
Read hope we're we are afraid of

2643
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,232
Of people who aren't

2644
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,000
Paying attention

2645
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,304
Who show up and all the sudden

2646
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:33,120
Hear your b******* and think all that makes sense

2647
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:37,472
If you are a nympho Warrior it's not because you were on the left

2648
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
And you got

2649
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:40,800
Current now is because you were kind of not

2650
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,824
Paying attention

2651
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,848
And then you got

2652
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:47,200
Caught up in this emotional bulshit from childhood trauma that

2653
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,480
Ya heard by a lot of it

2654
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:52,832
The middle is not a thing

2655
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,368
If we uninformed

2656
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Yeah

2657
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,416
I agree

2658
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,184
So anyway

2659
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,000
Seclusion

2660
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:06,912
I know maybe a dozen people named Lucia

2661
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:14,080
Jordan is really bad and we have one more

2662
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:19,456
So we got a hard and so we are going to rush through the rapper Quest at the end of that

2663
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:20,992
Alright

2664
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:26,624
But I told you

2665
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:28,928
Yes and I don't have to pee so bad that

2666
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,512
Live invest cuz this Cliffhanger is

2667
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,560
Such a professional broadcast

2668
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
Earlier

2669
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:37,632
Alex's Superbad

2670
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,936
The the college column

2671
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,472
From

2672
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,008
Saint wherever

2673
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,568
Alex has dispatch

2674
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,592
Owen Shroyer

2675
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,640
What go to that camp

2676
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:52,224
Probably

2677
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,528
Owen Shroyer

2678
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,088
Intention that they had

2679
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:57,856
Was Alex

2680
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,136
Was going to go to him live

2681
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,696
Owen Shroyer

2682
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,512
Is the Cox Slayer he's the guy who goes out

2683
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:07,328
He got the job at Infowars because of videos

2684
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,400
They posted on YouTube where he would go in

2685
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:12,704
With people College liberals

2686
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:15,776
Manipulative

2687
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:20,384
What about what about what about

2688
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:23,968
That's how he got his job

2689
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,808
But it seems more and more every time he goes out

2690
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
He ends up getting

2691
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,184
Flipped off by a little kid

2692
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,744
FIFA November 4th thing that was just

2693
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,512
The huge boss

2694
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:40,096
You can't hold his own the way that Alex needs him

2695
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:42,400
I'm too he's not good on the war room either

2696
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,936
Alex's losing faith in

2697
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,984
And you can see it in this clip

2698
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,264
Because

2699
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,568
Owen Shroyer they go to the video

2700
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,360
And they can't play the audio

2701
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:55,968
But at the same time Alex presented as like

2702
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:57,504
He's under attack

2703
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,528
That kind of thing

2704
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,296
It's not

2705
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:02,112
He's just having a bad argument with a couple people

2706
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
Listen to

2707
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
This s***

2708
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:15,680
Busting in on our right now

2709
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,896
Earlier

2710
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:31,808
Incredible

2711
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:45,120
Give me the video

2712
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,016
It's just

2713
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,096
I don't f****** know

2714
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:21,984
Any of the videos we have to do I don't know anything

2715
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,312
Yeah right

2716
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:32,224
Ashley

2717
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,528
I forgot to take a shower

2718
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:47,584
Okay let's go

2719
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:52,960
Lenny just throws it to a videos

2720
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:55,264
Are they playing couples videos at like distance

2721
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:58,848
Half an hour before he was supposed to get off air

2722
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:02,176
Two-and-a-half hours a day show Rapaport doing the 4th hour

2723
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,904
Spending most of his time talking about how he knows the rush it is

2724
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,256
Here's what I want to say about that

2725
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,560
His argument

2726
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:21,120
Hilarious Alex Jones

2727
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:21,888
Something

2728
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:25,472
I think I think by argument that he's lost faith in Owen Shroyer

2729
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:29,568
Is much more on point then he needs to share I think it's more like

2730
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:36,480
Somebody's got to take this I got to help him out I got to help him out

2731
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:40,832
Embarrassing video this going to be a disaster I've got to go gal myself

2732
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:44,160
What I got to do everything around here

2733
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,208
But Rappaport comes in

2734
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,024
He knows that the the rush it

2735
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:51,328
Cuz

2736
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,864
Is Russia

2737
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,936
Flipped Donald Trump

2738
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:58,240
The greatest

2739
02:12:58,496 --> 02:12:59,008
Secret ever

2740
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,800
And no one would talk

2741
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:03,104
Covid-19 is a Christopher

2742
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,872
Steel

2743
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,920
Who's a long time

2744
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,456
Would have contacts

2745
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:10,272
That would be like oh yeah also

2746
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:15,392
That's no one would ever talk about that

2747
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,440
So are so it's all a lie

2748
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:18,976
I don't believe it

2749
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,768
At the same time

2750
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:23,072
If you're playing that game

2751
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:25,632
And using that logic

2752
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,168
Was born in Kenya

2753
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,448
Well that's one

2754
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:31,776
But then also let's use that logic and apply it to

2755
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
You know

2756
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:35,104
We fund Isis

2757
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:39,968
If that were true that would be the greatest secret ever

2758
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:45,088
No one would talk about that are go all of Alex's mysterious secret sources

2759
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:49,440
Couldn't possibly be saying that cuz they wouldn't do that

2760
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,096
Are we turned over

2761
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,656
Or we supported the coup of

2762
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,264
So I mean like

2763
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:10,176
That's an argument you can use for

2764
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,200
Any everything

2765
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:13,248
Yeah a rapport does his

2766
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,040
Right

2767
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,576
Legatron

2768
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:20,672
If you really had to pee based on how professional are broadcasting

2769
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,720

2772
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:30,656
To get people to think that we don't have enough

2773
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:37,056
Hard I swear I was just trying to come up with my own cliffhanger

2774
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:39,360
Stuck around and tried to watch the more and see if Alex

2775
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:43,456
Shows up in Ocho Rios video but I was so bored of a300

2776
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:48,832
Tomorrow maybe they'll have some videos of Alex

2777
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,600
That be fun

2778
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:56,512
