Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Monica

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,512
Acknowledge

6
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
About Alex

00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
Brick by today

10
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
We just recorded our bright spot inside realize that it was not recorded

11
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
It's Crusade

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,016
I hit the button to start recording not saying cuz I did I would not say that I just believe

13
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Cheryl bright spots with each other for a second time so if any of this sounds insincere

14
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Great rip

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,560
Totally you guys missed out on going to feel like I can't bring anything

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
I know it's tough

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,216
How to bring the same energy know anyway by bright spot is world music

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm just worried like I told you earlier on the first time

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,016
I'm worried that I'm becoming my parents

21
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,136
Because they used to have a lot of interest in a lot of music from around the world

22
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,488
Particularly this disband you through gindi which is a lot of

23
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
Since and also tribal

24
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Sounds Oceania

25
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
And

26
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,336
I was on Spotify for the episode

27
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,456
What to put on music in the background while I'm like researching and reading up on stuff

28
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
IND

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,552
See what you got

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
You didn't know what I've listened to

31
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,440
Let's see if you can hit a homerun

32
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
And there was some music from Malawi

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
That ended up coming up

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,608
And I really really enjoyed it and I'm worried is going to set me off

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Our path

36
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Of just like

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,008
You getting into all sorts of stuff from around the world

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Never nothing

39
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
You should try them out there fantastic

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Miss down there's all kinds of great music

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
I think it's a little bit

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Cliche to referee

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Prince them because they're probably

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Probably

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:10,464
Or maybe not maybe no one has any idea about that except for in the weird circles that I live in that might be

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
It's so cliche to reference Orchestra Baobab you know the thing everyone remain on one of our bonus episodes

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Talk about your love of really obscure music you can't tell who knows what

48
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,152
This might be a new little bit of an auditory adventure for me I'm excited to embark on it and

49
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,760
And I'll find out what the rest of the world has to offer at

50
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
Awesome

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Creed Valhalla

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
It's

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
The game I enjoyed it

54
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
I want to say that I already knew that the first time around but now it's the second time

55
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
Really not twice

56
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
Just did that surprised even already know the story that I hit my bright spot is so it's not even do that cuz you texted me

57
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
About it before the PlayStore you recorded

58
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
The video game is that what you wanted to hear dance for you cuz it's been a long time coming you're very excited about this game been

59
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
Favorite series in originally ordered a found out on the nights that my copy wooden

60
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
12 +

61
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
I have reached that time

62
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Console

63
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,359
Cartridges ink cartridges

64
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Yeah I know and it wasn't going to show up in

00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Until the 17th so

66
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
On the 9th I was like

67
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
F*** this

68
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831

It wasn't it was going to be available at 11

70
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Spice scrambled and got the

71
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,559
The download copy as soon as I possibly could you go

72
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
Another week

73
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Flights

74
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Yeah and I'm like that

75
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Experience

76
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
I must be part of the zeitgeist

77
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
So I've been busy cuz you know

78
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:12,319
The show and what have you and other related projects

79
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,183
It so I haven't had a lot of time to play it but I did preorder a digital copy myself

80
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Play a little bit

81
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,839
Play the little bit the other night I'm not going very far into it and I'm concerned

82
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Now here's why okay

83
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Know a lot about Norse and Vikings stuff sure is other.

84
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,687
Oceans of the game where like sodas mythologies cultural histories that I know a little bit more about

85
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,063
Does your wheelhouse early before it was Egypt yeah yeah I know that about you.

86
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Egyptian history

87
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
I know very little

88
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
And I realized why

89
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
It's those letters

90
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
It's the letter U the ruins

91
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
No I just can't handle

92
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
The weird combination of letters

93
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
Eminem's and stuff

94
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
Intimidates me and I don't know what to do with those V's

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Why is Jesus everywhere

96
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
It scares me

97
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
I realize that so conscious bias

98
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
Has kept me away embarked on a little bit

99
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
Find out some stuff that I can then maybe read up on the real version

100
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
And then I also really funny about that is

101
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
Having played just a little bit further into you

102
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Into the game than you

103
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
After the title card which is going to like

104
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
4 hours 5 hours a night

105
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Even come close to that I'm sure

106
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
Where is wheelers

107
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,319
3 hours from now

108
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
But the other thing

109
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
Actually kind of puts to bed my other worried about game

110
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm having again played very little up

111
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm worried it's

112
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
But not in with white

113
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
People wave to I mean no

114
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
There's so much goddamn snow around individually

115
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Monochromatic

116
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
To a level that if it were the entire game

117
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
I would have a problem with that I think I would have it would be a difficulty

118
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
Because of the open-world exploration has back if you just running around everywhere snow-covered

119
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
Even with Witcher 3 it wasn't gloomy all the

120
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Yeah it was gloomy

121
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Most of the

122
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
And they were sort of variation

123
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Since to the Gloom

124
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Yeah there's like Gloom

125
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
You got them well I'm glad to know that some of these

126
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
Concerns that I have whether it be letter or snow base

127
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
The developers of those games enough

128
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Not make

129
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
A game that's all Snow Elementary

130
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,791
Peppa Pig but I did not know that was mainly snow so

131
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Skip that one for good

132
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Skip it

133
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
Out of here a little snow

134
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Pennywise you don't mind

135
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,311
A little snowpocalypse

136
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Jordan

137
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Today the present going to be talking about November 7th

138
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
We're entering that interesting. Where we find out what Alex does during the 79 days of hell

139
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
We experience

140
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
What happened to Alex left

141
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095

00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:42,495
Today we jump I guess we're just pretending none of this s*** happen

143
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
I was bored at 7

144
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
1583

145
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
My father was a Highlander and so am I

146
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,039
I had to kill him that can be only one I don't know exactly how we're doing it but

147
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
I guess we're just pretending

148
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
That never happened on Saturday

149
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Alex is doing a broadcast on Saturday the 7th

00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023

Money off that heroin

167
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
Is freakishly large

168
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
Into the forest

169
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,767

170
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Warning

Oh okay

174
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
What else could people

175
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
Well you know what Dan some people could absolutely be filled with that generous spirit

176
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:15,839
Want to give or donate to someone but then realize that they would have to wait a week

177
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Deal with that

178
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,727
You just can't wait a week because the generous spirit is so strong within you

179
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
Find a way to get that money out now then

180
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
I was worried it was going to end or silver some some nonsense

181
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Whatever

182
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
You know what I'm saying

183
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Today Show

184
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Dancing with the Stars

185
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
In the final episode or whatever

186
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
Cuz I'm a big TV guy that I do like watching

187
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Good looking women

188
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Let's go to see celebrities

189
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
You don't need to justify why you watching TV show

190
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,719
Look I got tricks to Sean Spicer was on and I watched it

191
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Whatever

192
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
Actually I don't even like the dancing at all the way that they couldn't pick at pirouette and throws and then

193
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
It seems unmanly for me to enjoy what I'm able.

194
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
So sad

195
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Secure about what

196
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Enjoy what you enjoy

197
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Anyway here we go quit jumping in on the seven

198
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
What's Saturday Alex's day off

199
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
He's in any way back from his trip

200
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
To Phoenix

201
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Swear yelled into adult-sized bullhorn

202
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
And

203
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Is Biden's really present

204
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
It looks like he is

205
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Saturday

206
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
November 7th the year of 2020

207
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
We accept

208
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
False claims of Joe Biden

209
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Chinese deep State handlers that he is

210
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
President probably just Witness

211
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Then you could

212
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Really see this as a

213
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Good day

214
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
To put on the Republic

215
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Austin Stone

216
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Born

217
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
July 4th

218
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
1776

219
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Died November 7th

220
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
2020

221
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
That's what this is

222
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
How is it called it

223
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Death of America November 7th

224
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,495
As as a millionaire I can tell you that the

225
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
The tragedy of the Biden

226
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
Administration will be that they raise the marginal income tax on

227
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Individuals making over 500,000

228
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
$1 a year to above

229
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
35

230
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
But that is the end of the reports that I hear

231
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
I think that's

232
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:51,999
The end of the Republic funeral of America

233
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Imagine how angry

234
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
2 Chainz is going to be then so so mad he's still mad

235
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
In this next clip

236
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Will you learn

237
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Look at this is the problem that I have to show talking about put this date on America's Tombstone 2

238
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Like this

239
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
About the failures of trump and in

240
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
And why this was able to happen

241
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Talk about

242
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
What Trump should have done better

243
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Where to do that sweet leaf

244
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
What next time

245
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Wonder what the f*** next time

246
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
According to Alex there is no next time

247
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,303
This isn't just a political party that you disagree with it now has control of the executive branch of the government

248
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
This is the f****** devil taking over

249
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
Without Trump there to stop them the story supposed to be that there's nothing to protect the Patriots from getting rounded up in the entire world being

250
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Killed off with the super bioweapon

251
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
A false-flag ice age

252
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
With Alex's feeling bad guys gone for sure

253
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
It's downright insulting for Alex Devin nerve

254
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
To act like a political commentator right now

255
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
When is candidate has been projected to lose

256
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
Do you have this tantrum about the death of the Republic being on November 7th and immediately gets into the mode expectancy on regular outlet

257
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,703
They're doing a post-mortem on the campaign where were the flaws in the strategy where is there room for improvement

258
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
We can do better next time let's talk midterms

259
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Normal people get to do that

260
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:14,687
Because they don't live in artificial reality that used to abused their audiences where if their guy loses the election

261
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,039
Pedophile demons will run the street the gods Firefield judgment will be upon us

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,135
Alex don't get to war game but the midterms he lost that right when he made

263
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
The terms of this election

264
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Supernatural

265
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
Yeah I believe it was

266
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
If Biden wins

267
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Is there going to switch

268
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
To plan B

269
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Kill all of us a media

270
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
It wasn't even conditional on the election that was just something Alex that they decided to do

271
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Because Alex is too effective in a bad mood

272
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
All the Infowars too strong so they're going to just kill a dog

273
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
They like to do because the devil

274
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,927
Love plan I don't even think that you know what there's nothing to be ashamed about losing to the devil you're supposed

275
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,791
Salute to the devil the only person who wins against The Travelers Jesus man

276
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
I was Johnny rising up that bow and play cards

277
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
Johnny was really a Christ metaphor

278
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
The whole world

279
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
It's really just about fiddle flakes

280
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
The devil acted with honor and Fiddle like the other rip-off songs of the Devil Went Down

281
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
Georgia I bet I think some other people might have

282
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
There is at least one juggler Who Went Down to Georgia

283
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Inform me of the song Like The Devil Went Down to Detroit rap version

284
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
Heavy like a DJ contest with the devil I think they win

285
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
Okay I don't know if look a lot of people may have

286
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Fictitious Libby the devil's butt

287
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,063
Look there's no shame in that you're not supposed to beat the devil why are you beating yourself up over

288
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
He's beating himself up

289
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,719
I want to stress one of the compelling reasons not to respect Alex Jones

290
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
He's an intellectual coward

291
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
He can't stand to be wrong to such a ridiculous

292
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,471
Except that he set up this election as a battle between good and evil which evil could not possibly win and even if they did

293
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,079
Good secretly actually won because evil cheated in a way that's never going to be proven

294
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
Now that the supposedly evil side is one

295
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,223
Alex won't even stick to his own parameters and act like a literal devil

296
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
This beat is gyro

297
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
I was going to leave it at the Integrity to present for a minute to any of the stuff you screaming about

298
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Fake crying about on-air means anything

299
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,047
Because it's time to move on and learn the lessons of the last election and apply them to whatever white supremacist he supports next time

300
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Because they insist they're just a national

301
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
He's a child

302
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
This more than

303
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Any other moment

304
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Is it very clear and unmistakable in

305
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Instance of

306
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Treat

307
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
Get the f*** out of here that learning lessons for next time sheet

308
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
Nope other people get

309
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,015
To do I resent that are very few situations where I don't

310
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Now that many of these people are private cities

311
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
We should spit on them every

312
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Single time they go outside

313
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
Like there's no way Alex should not be spit on regularly

314
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
There's no way that

315
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Like f******

316
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,399
If Trump walks down f****** A Street in Manhattan

317
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
He should be Spit On by thousands of people on a cont

318
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Yeah I think that you could make an argument that spitting is a form of assault

319
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
And maybe I'm not into that fair

320
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Yelling is better

321
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
I'll go with you as far as yelling you're alright

322
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
Anytime Alex leaves his house people

323
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,255
Surrounded with

324
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
I think is a little bit gross

325
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
Express support

326
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,663
Through your mask

327
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Perfectly

328
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,575
Yeah I think I think that's a middle ground should be hounded to the ends of the Earth

329
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
Barkat people through bullhorn

330
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Alex

331
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,791
Concerned that a lot of his everyone

332
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Never was getting kicked off how the

333
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
I mean taking off

334
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Social media platforms

335
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
You see the mass censorship now

336
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Predicted almost total censorship

337
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
No media that I saw Carrington

338
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Thank God it right side Broadcasting

339
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Thank God you're out there a

340
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
This is a serious

341
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
War

342
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
Everyone's getting taken out

343
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,743
Infowars and right side broadcasting the stand-up

344
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,327
Hover Rudy giuliani's wonderful press conference but he's got to

345
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
I would expect the most media Outlets if they didn't

346
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,727
They didn't cover Rudy giuliani's press conference out of respect for him

347
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
That s*** was super embarrassed

348
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
Also it wasn't censored people were making fun of it all over the place

349
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
This was of course the Four Seasons press conference

350
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,527
As best as anyone can tell someone in the campaign may have thought that they booked

351
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
The Four Seasons hotel conference room for the Presser

352
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
But it actually set up a event in front of a small Landscaping

353
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
When company called for season

354
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Total Landscaping

355
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:20,351
I have no idea what actually happened here if they intended it to be there or someone screwed up

356
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
What is pretty hilarious

357
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
Giuliani gabri rambling nonsense Beach

358
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,311
Right at the moment when the Network's called the racer Vidant it was a total mess

359
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Also during the event

360
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
One of giuliani's guest wasn't a legend

361
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Pull Watcher name Darrell Brooks

362
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Who turned out to also have been quote

363
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,087
Incarcerated in the 1990s on charges of sexual assault lewdness

364
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,903
And endangering the welfare of a minor by exposing a

365
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
Himself to two girls ages 7 and 11 it's a false flag Democrat if I ever heard one according to the NRA

366
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
The Cut quote Brooks denied the charges and said his arrest was a police set up

367
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
So it's a double false flag

368
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Perhaps

369
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,127
He was false Flags into becoming the false flag that's what happened I don't know

370
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,551
You know who this guy is somebody whose identifiable it makes things a little bit more confusing for the claims that were being made

371
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,672
Apparently was being alleged that Brooks was a poll Watcher in Philadelphia

372
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,280
And you know like not being allowed into check the check the rolls and everything

373
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
He lives in New Jersey

374
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
And it's not like he's a low-profile New Jersey resident

375
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,288
An article in Politico quoted read escoria the mayor of Trenton New Jersey Asda

376
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
Describing Brooks as quote

377
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
New Jersey's perennial candidate

378
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Because Brooks

379
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,992
Did run from many different offices in New Jersey including the Senate and House

380
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,368
The state of Pennsylvania requires poll Watchers to be registered voters in the County's they wished

381
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Apple watch

382
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
So he couldn't actually been in a position

383
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
To actually

384
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Make the claim that he was living

385
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Disaster for Giuliani location to the almost comical

386
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Bad timing to the pool water

387
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,008
Alleged who I had as a witness

388
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Possibly be a poll watcher

389
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Abbott is actually a convicted child abuser

390
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
If anything I would

391
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Alex

392
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
Coverage of this everything is bad

393
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,808
Every element of that press conference was bad I mean

394
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
A perfect

395
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Example of how we are held hostage

396
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
By their own reality

397
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
Should be a criminal offense

398
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
All the stuff that happened at that press

399
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
I know they're not illegal but if you do that

400
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
You can't be near other people bohorse we need Crews of people with tiny bullhorn

401
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
On the ready

402
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,200
That's what Arkham Asylum is for people who acts

403
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Dental

404
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,368
Play escaping

405
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
That's not it's not a

406
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
Crime it's something that people need to be kept there

407
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Pizza Hut

408
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Killer Croc

409
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Got Rudy Giuliani

410
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Why why are you here

411
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
I set up a weird Prescott

412
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
They would all be like yeah I know you're the only one we're not let it go

413
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,200
Whatever the Riddler comes unless I believe Rudy

414
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
At least we get the place we're going to hoist

415
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:23,904
Right because we got to the wrong place okay

416
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,816
They are there like the whole no no no really you got to take me to give a message to to the back for us

417
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
God

418
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
What'd

419
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
A******

420
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Jesus

421
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
So Alex gets to talk in about

422
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
The China

423
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,688
Has this interesting idea that you know isn't based in

424
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
And really anything

425
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
But

426
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
I got really lost him

427
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
Thought after listen

428
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
This Cliff because I think it's really

429
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
Really good example of why

430
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
It is really frustrating to take things that Alex says

431
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Seriously

432
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
So instead of making

433
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
China Cafe

434
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Criminal elements

435
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Rockefeller combine

436
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Go back to the

437
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
The real world

438
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
George Herbert Walker Bush in there

439
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
James Baker

440
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,552
To make a deal to Tommy's Chinese after they spent

441
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
25-years enslaving

442
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Killing

443
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
89 other people

444
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Behave

445
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
Every follower every directive

446
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
One child policy

447
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
She's a horrible thing

448
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
The Rockefellers told to do

449
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
I said yeah kill about 89 your people

450
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
One child policy will make you

451
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
The global superpower of

452
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
Economics but you're not allowed to have a big military

453
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Course

454
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Winter globalist

455
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
They were

456
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Obama

457
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Because China weather

458
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
The following its

459
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Expansionist

460
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Minerals

461
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Call economic power

462
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Economically span

463
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
But America would

464
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
Economically close

465
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
But then

466
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
So that's how you divide power

467
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Rollerball

468
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Allegory

469
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Or whatever it is

470
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Of course

471
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
It's always

472
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
Always a f****** movie

473
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
That's why I like

474
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
It's so frustrating to listen to I'm like it starts with that clip their it starts something really absurd

475
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
The decision was made by people like the Rockefellers

476
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,160
Deb trying to not be capitalist at the end of WWII

477
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
They're going to think it's me kinda interested

478
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,048
Well at least it would have surely wrongdoing the show

479
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
It's a laughable and nonsensical claim

480
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,912
You know that even without doing any reason

481
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,568
I would ask Alex to explain What mechanisms were used by the Rockefellers to keep China from being a capitalist

482
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
If I were to do this

483
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Because of doing Michelle

484
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
I know that Alex would just point to John Birch

485
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Society talk

486
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
Complaints about how the US didn't do enough to help Shane Kai-shek in the Chinese Civil War

487
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,160
Which is the claim it's been exaggerated into the Rockefellers installed Mouse

488
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
I like this absurd claim

489
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,816
It's stupid but probably sounds smart to his audience and I can kind of appreciate that

490
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
Kind of the sort of thing that

491
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,936
I did my my my teeth into

492
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,080
He claims that David Rockefeller wrote a book into articles in the times about this whole China stuff and that's just not true

493
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,480
The op-ed Rockefeller wrote don't look great with the hind side of history on our side but they're nothing like Alex is claiming them

494
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
He also wrote a book called memoirs

495
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Which is an autobiography but if that admission is in there

496
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
Really simple for Alex

497
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Reproduce which weirdly never does

498
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,584
When everything falls apart with the rambling about the imaginary deal where China gets to have the economy and us gets to have the middle

499
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Military which incidentally is something

500
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
Similar to like

501
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,288
Something Alex might be cribbing from the piece of dystopian sci-fi from the time when he was a child

502
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
Seems to be a pattern does seem like that is

503
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Often the case

504
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
The original movie Rollerball

505
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Logan

506
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
The original movie rollerball was based on a short story called rollerball Murder By William Neil Harrison published in

507
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
Esquire in September 1973

508
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
It's a little bit different than what the movie ended up being as

509
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
It's far more to statement about the rising brutality

510
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Publix taste in entertainment

511
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
They're also similarities to the movie version no like it's

512
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
The kind of clunky

513
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
And not

514
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Not super

515
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Short story itself

516
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
This Bears a lot of mention of

517
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Various women's

518
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
Shay pleiness

519
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Great in the movie

520
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Sure

521
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
I-Ready

522
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,112
God was talking about like

523
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Love doing those rollerball scene

524
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
I had to go Act

525
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
That was about as processed for thief

526
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,144
Too I think I love those rollerball C

527
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
In the short

528
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Story it's not so much like differ

529
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Countries do different things

530
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
It's fit within the United States different corporations run six different

531
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Concerns of life

532
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Energy transport Food House

533
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Services and Lux

534
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:08,832
You just a super powerful Corporation in the main character Jonathan he plays for the roller ball team run by energy

535
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
B company based in Hughes

536
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,000
The actual story is about a guy who's the best roller ball player in the world struggling with his sense of self

537
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,608
Finding himself unsatisfied while living the life filled with money power sex and celebrity

538
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:26,496
The brutality of the sport has been increasing with new rules being added to satisfy the Public's lust for violence

539
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
Gradually things get more vile

540
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,872
With rules added to penalize players who aren't trying hard enough

541
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
By having their helmets confiscated

542
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
This all culminates in the All-Star Game

543
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
The end of the season

544
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
Where there's a new rule that's added where there's no time limit for the game

545
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
Essentially making a gladiatorial contest we're pretty much everyone is guaranteed to die

546
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768
Johnson wants something more out of his life but he doesn't know what

547
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
But as the All-Star Game gets

548
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,888
Closer his only request is that he'll be able to see his estranged wife

549
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,008
She comes to him and they f*** for a few days and then they remember their shared love that they had

550
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Jonathan had convinced himself that in the past

551
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
Been taken from him by the evil Corporation

552
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
But he realizes that wasn't

553
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
The case

554
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
It would be nice I think wants to imagine that she was taken away from me by some malevolent force and they soften

555
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
Age but I know the truth of that

556
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
She went away

557
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Simply because I wasn't enough back

558
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,000
Because those were the days when I urine

559
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Before I urine for anything

560
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
When I was beginning to leave to play the game

561
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
But no matter

562
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
For a few days she sits on my bed and I touch her skin like a blind

563
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,336
It's implied that they both realize they can't go back to their younger lives even if there is love

564
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
Between them and Jonathan nose

565
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
He has to play the All-Star Game

566
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
Even if it means almost certain death

567
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
The story concludes quote

568
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,112
Before the game begins I stand with my team as a corporation him plays

569
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,208
I'm brutespeed today I tell myself trying to rest myself up yet

570
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
I dream in my thoughts

571
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
I'm a bit

572
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
I'm convinced

573
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,120
A Chorus of voices joins the band now is the music swells

574
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
The game the game all glory to at the music rings

575
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
And I can feel my lips

576
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Smooth with the words

577
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Singing

578
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
William Harrison fleshed-out the story into a screenplay that no longer really resembles the point of this original work

579
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
Some parts of it that are still carried over

580
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Actually directly contradicted

581
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Certain points

582
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
The director of the movie It

583
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
Explain why they made the movie

584
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Tell him to Guardian quote

585
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,744
I thought that violence for the entertainment of the masses was an obscene idea

586
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
This is what I saw coming and that's why I made

587
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
The film

588
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
The original in the movie or both commentaries on the idea of brutality as entertainment but in order to make the movie out of 8

589
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
10-page story

590
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,848
We needed to add a whole plot about the corporations fearing the Jonathan was becoming too much of

591
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,152
An individual and corporate world built on

592
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
Conformity or Logan's Run to just come out recently

593
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
The game and the people's reaction to it

594
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,624
As well as the violence depicted in the movie itself and the people's reaction to that

595
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Where the point of the movie Rollerball

596
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
If it has any artistic

597
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
Text Mary it's that attempt for a state

598
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
The dystopian sci-fi future backdrop

599
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Absolutely unnoticed

600
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
And the only really exist as a way of justifying why the game exist

601
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Yeah yeah

602
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Alex doesn't know how to wrestle with or analyze works of art

603
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,456
He refuses to understand subtext or deeper meaning makes perfect sense

604
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
He'd think that all this

605
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
Dystopian fiction from his youth to secretly about the

606
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
The Communist conspiracy

607
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
But no one will admit it's right in front of their face

608
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Here's an example

609
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
There is a phenomenon

610
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
You could point

611
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Which is that a lot of movies

612
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
He's particularly dystopian action movies seem to exist in a world ruled by Ridgid authoritarian to have molded Society into

613
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
Estate of uniformity

614
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,776
You could point this out and provide a number of examples

615
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
And that's fair

616
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,408
Alex might see this phenomenon and argue that this is because the globalist through using Purdue

617
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
Addictive programming to tell the world about what they're going to do to that

618
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
There's a cosmic

619
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Contract law Clause that states

620
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,160
Unless we all consent to them so they put the stuff in movies

621
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
To get us to accept it

622
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
That is the theory

623
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
For why there's such a consistent feature like this

624
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
In this genre

625
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
I would argue that it's

626
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
Because the setting of a rigid uniform world is 1 worth in

627
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Incredibly easy

628
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
The differentiated hero character from the rest of the world

629
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,408
Even an antihero or a flawed person could easily be cheer for when they're the only person

630
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,992
With any modicum of individuality in a city full of facelessness

631
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Putting your character in their story into that setting

632
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
It's kind of a genre based shortcut

633
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
A plot where the tension is about individualism vs

634
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Conformity

635
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,840
And gave him a text and art with even just a baseline of critical ability allows you to see authorial intent

636
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,168
I do understand the more complicated things that are being said by artists

637
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
And it brings a richness to your life

638
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,568
It's a critically important exercise now more than ever and honestly

639
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,872
It's one of the things I find Most Fascinating but out

640
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
I do believe that most of the stuff he says is embellishment

641
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,808
He doesn't actually believe we're kind of believed

642
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
But his inability to grasp the point of literature and movies

643
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Is something soak

644
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
Consistent in his career that I find it difficult to accept that it's not a genuine

645
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Future of his brain

646
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
It's annoying

647
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
To do this show because I end up thinking

648
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,704
Think about Rollerball

649
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,336
There was an attempted statement that they were making there in the desert of the corporations and ship

650
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
In the movie and all that

651
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Is really just

652
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
2

653
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Make it so you're watching this movie really exist

654
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Would never exist in our world

655
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
The commentary is about

656
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
People's taste

657
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
4

658
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Sports

659
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
And entertained becoming more and more violent

660
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
And The Logical extension of that

661
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Is

662
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
A game where

663
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Killing each other

664
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
That itself

665
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Could not exist

666
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
In our reality

667
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
So the commentary couldn't be made

668
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
By plugging it into the present day

669
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,272
Is there any things like hey why is no one getting sued for this never fly

670
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,136
Plug it into this dystopian authoritarian world in the shooter

671
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Yeah

672
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,024
And it makes it so much easier to cheer on your hero Jonathan M

673
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Even if you

674
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
Rhino not a great person

675
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,704
I wonder I wonder what it would have been like if Alex would instead of being into hard sci-fi

676
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,776
And gotten watching rollerball at that age and it said watch

677
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Like They Shoot Horses Don't They

678
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,688
Watching Everybody she's in that f****** exploitative destructive dance contest

679
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
Realize and get a real.

680
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,552
Dystopia is where we live now

681
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
I just

682
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
I just

683
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
I don't know

684
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
I do wish

685
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
He was better

686
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah that would be

687
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
I wish a lot of food

688
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
Almost everyone was better

689
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Activate a difficult skill

690
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,008
It is it seems like it should be easy considering we talk to each other

691
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
But then you think about and you realize most people don't even talk to me

692
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
Which other honestly

693
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
It's really hard to understand what people are saying cuz their brains don't

694
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Speak the word

695
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Their brains think

696
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,088
One of the more interesting things that is like an alien right now

697
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
They act so strange

698
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
So weird

699
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,976
What are the things I found what I was looking at

700
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Is reading about Rollerball

701
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Was beta the writer William Harrison

702
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
He was like

703
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
I want

704
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
More violent

705
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
This movie

706
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
But not because like he wants a movie to be super violent

707
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
To make the point

708
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
That the violence is supposed to be repulsive

709
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
So brutal that when you watch it you go you know and then when people watch

710
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,112
And then the director of it was talking about how I

711
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,440
Most of the most of the European audiences that we do no talk

712
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
To understand that is disgusting

713
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
We should start a rollerball League

714
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Frankly what

715
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,080
DTE what's the difference between CTE rollerball we might as well get rollerball while we're at it anyways

716
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:04,480
Vince McMahon get the ex-nfl the f*** out of here get the rfl right in here babe

717
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,064
That's what I'm talking about so anyway that there was that

718
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,440
It's sort of sidetracked by the roller ball off today

719
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
We get two more complaints about China

720
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
We live on earth

721
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
It's all been one-sided

722
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
It's not about

723
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Kumbaya.

724
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Brake stop

725
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Competition was allowed to buy a park that

726
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
Hollywood

727
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
The crusher

728
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
So I've been thinking about this for a while

729
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,688
I think this is one of the newer formulations of like the Jews around all the bank

730
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,344
Yeah that kind of bigger than the Chinese

731
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
The new one of those

732
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
Sounds like something they heard someone say before

733
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
Intimidating thing where you like

734
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Why would you buy debt

735
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Yeah just complete bulshit

736
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
According to MarketWatch the US government itself owns

737
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,224
27% of the US debt with us investors own in the further 32.5%

738
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,344
The Federal Reserve owns 11.2% which is just a slightly more complicated

739
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Was the government owning it

740
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,512
So all that added up is 70.9% of the US national debt that's owned essentially by USA

741
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Sure

742
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
Compared to that the amount owned by China is not that much

743
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,472
As of 2018 they held about 5.6% of our national debt in the form of

744
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Like treasury bonds

745
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,848
But Japan also at 4.9%

746
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
The dreaded Japanese threat Olive a Makar

747
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
These countries have bought these bonds

748
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,296
Because generally speaking they're considered good investment

749
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Since most world currency is tied to the dollar

750
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,256
Also in 2020 Japan overtook China is the largest foreign investor in our debts the dynamic that Alex

751
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Describing

752
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Is even more

753
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
What you're getting wrong there is China on

754
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
99% of

755
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Pan's death

756
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
So they secretly owned

757
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,288
All of the other 4.4%

758
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:10,688
Do people date did they want to spread this fear and what is based on is the idea of the China owns our debt and what they

759
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Can do is they can

760
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,784
Can call in that debt that you repay your debt

761
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,184
Like a landlord who's giving you a slide exactly

762
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
It's based on

763
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
More less nothing

764
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,816
Alex wants to create that image because it means the China rules

765
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
They can say the word Indus

766
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Destroying our economy a10e

767
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
They don't own enough of our debt to really

768
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Matter that much

769
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,032
In that in that term

770
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
And also investing in our debt doesn't work like

771
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,664
Our national debt is a super complicated thing

772
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,016
Isn't the same as your personal debt that you might have if you're like a late on a gas bill

773
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,880
They're too many real-world factors to make it sensible discusses like a one factor thing like

774
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,952
Bigger number that equals worse or whatever

775
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
But that's basically what Alex is doing and then adding on a layer of

776
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
Conspiracy China baiting for fun

777
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,680
Jonathan by up all are dead they don't own Hollywood and they didn't buy all our info

778
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,520
Talking point Alex repeats over and over again

779
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
Until his audience accepts them as being fat

780
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
But it's all just

781
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
Warmed-over Bircher nonsense

782
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
It's very interesting to me that

783
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Like

784
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
One of the ways that the

785
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Conservative

786
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Propaganda

787
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Just get normal people

788
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
To believe their bulshit

789
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
Is because they try and make it that micro-level of like

790
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
You have

791
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
If someone calls in that debt

792
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
That'll suck

793
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:36,448
The same thing is true for the United States but what they don't realize is that when you get

794
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Get to the United States

795
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
Money is imaginary is it called in our debt what happens

796
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,872
We print more and then inflation goes up and

797
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
Their money's worth

798
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,480
You know there is a

799
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Serious

800
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
Incentive for them not

801
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
To do that

802
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
Based on their own economy

803
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
That's fine

804
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
You're just inflation goes up and all other kinds

805
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,400
The b******* happens there's a hundred different after effects of that

806
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Do magic

807
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Magic

808
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Even that

809
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Being understood

810
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
What Alex is saying is

811
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
It sounds compelling

812
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,576
It's very simple that like get across

813
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,880
I want to ask you a question here Jordan Shore

814
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,512
I think that you've done Elena we've we've been at this for a while you understand Alex pretty well

815
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
In this Mexico power to discuss it with his greatest

816
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Sadness is

817
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:41,216
Do you think that you could guess what his greatest sadness is

818
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
On the ending SWAT

819
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Lots of dead dogs in his wake

820
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
I would assume that that guilt would weigh heavily upon

821
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Money talks about it

822
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
It seems like as dogs had it coming

823
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
I know you're incorrect

824
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Here's my greatest sadness

825
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
The average person that's a leftist

826
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Positive

827
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
They do when they get one degree

828
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
3 degrees

829
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Or they get some little government

830
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Bureaucracy

831
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
Once we overthrow America

832
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
Afraid of socialist Utopia

833
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
You're all going to be in charge and have mansion

834
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
And I believe this

835
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Brought into the

836
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
The power structure

837
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Absolute

838
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
They're vicious and they're hateful

839
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,608
So Alex is greatest sadness is over educated liberals leftist to Ensign jobs

840
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
So

841
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
So

842
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:48,032
At the Socialist Utopia is a capitalist Utopia where we switch who lives in mansions

843
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
Is that what he thinks is going on

844
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Yeah probably assume so real

845
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
He doesn't understand socialism at all

846
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
And it's next clip

847
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Alex

848
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,831
Is recognize that there are people showing up

849
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Maybe it's State Capitol

850
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,791
No I mean they're there their they're

851
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
Oh I wouldn't admit that right now

852
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,471
They're good Bakery what's going on

853
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,591
You know and stuff sure and because of this there's also a lot of people are showing up at the Y

854
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Let you know there's a few people now

855
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
But soon

856
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Lb million

857
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
So obvious

858
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
By the weekend

859
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Pick a Saturday

860
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
People on at work

861
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,023
Until they can use social media to say

862
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
People around the White House

863
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
Won't be a million today

864
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
It'll be a hundred thousand today

865
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Won't be annoying today

866
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Rihanna.

867
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,199
But by the time Trump isn't leaving in a week or two

868
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
They'll be a million 2 million

869
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
And they will

870
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Pair

871
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Those barricades up

872
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
The plant

873
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Democrats

874
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Your plan

875
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Hey

876
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
The Goblins have never gotten in trouble for

877
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
Anything they've done

878
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Hawaii

879
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Wouldn't they

880
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Do that

881
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
Because they're never

882
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Elder County

883
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
I mean if Trump black

884
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,751
Directly is like I don't respect the results of an election

885
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
I'm not leaving

886
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,895
I wouldn't be surprised if tons of people shelter

887
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Four numbers

888
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,503
But I will admit a million people showing up outside the White House doesn't seem

889
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
Impossible to me

890
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Pretty

891
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
That might happen if a leader refuses to step down

892
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
I think we could we could

893
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
To go real high

894
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
We could go real high there

895
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
Not good not good

896
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
Definitely not good

897
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
There were tense standoff

898
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,727
Outside the White House

899
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
A couple months

900
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,591
Over the George Floyd

901
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
Protest

902
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
I don't

903
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
I don't know if people would

904
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
Storm the White House

905
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
But

906
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:11,647
People will be shaking fences you think we're going to get a moat around the White House I don't know if you want to go with a moat

907
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
I don't I don't know I don't know

908
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
I don't know

909
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
You don't know

910
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
And I think it's I'm fine with that limb have the house

911
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
Pizza House

912
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Modern Warfare

913
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,799
Lachemann there give him a moat put alligators on their I was just thinking about if they do emotes

914
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
IV solution

915
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
Tons of Jell-O

916
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:39,807
Bunch of Jell-O powder in there

917
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,391
System may be outdated and tears of defensive effect

918
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,607
Anyway situation

919
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,983
I just really can't stand this waffly back-and-forth nonsense of

920
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,823
The f****** Devil's coming for next time

921
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Or this

922
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Apparently

923
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,967
Maybe maybe maybe everything will be alright

924
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Election fraud

925
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,719
How there's a very narrow way out of this

926
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
A very narrow way out of this

927
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
And then I'm going to

928
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Explain

929
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Is another path

930
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
And that path Act

931
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Orchestra

932
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
And very horrible

933
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
Bubble actually hasten the destruction of the global order

934
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
And they have stepped in

935
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Now I have no

936
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
I will go down

937
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
And don't worry

938
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
You're going to go down that path to

939
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Because there's no getting out of this now

940
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,279
Everyone is going to SeaWorld government manifest

941
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
You're going to see everything I told you come true

942
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Everything

943
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
So that's violence

944
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Oh that's

945
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
Street violence

946
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,335
That's a murder of your your neighbors and Lawrence doubt that's the other path

947
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
What does a narrow path

948
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Which is Trump

949
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Seizing power basically

950
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
You could kind of get the Santa like

951
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
Okay now the conversation is B

952
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Become Trump is got to become king

953
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Or else

954
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Bucking

955
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Yeah totally

956
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
And that's not

957
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
Encouraging no no no

958
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
Pursuit of a Baseline

959
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Just where we're at

960
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
I don't know if I enjoy that no I mean right now I enjoyed the election results coming in

961
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
And Biden winning

962
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Outright that's good stuff

963
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
What's the amount of overconfidence

964
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,783
Gloating

965
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
What's going on before

966
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Trump has

967
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,879
Entirely left the White House

968
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Google nerve-racking for me

969
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,511
I don't like it when people who I've seen before and

970
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
All of our lives

971
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Destroyed

972
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Because of it

973
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Goat again

974
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
I don't like it I don't like seeing it

975
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Yeah

976
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
I think because of

977
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
This kind of contest

978
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
The territory really don't know

979
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
How much of the stuff that goes on

980
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Between an election

981
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
And an inauguration

982
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
He's a normie

983
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,015
We're going to turn out to be a lot

984
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
Save-A-Lot in Newark

985
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,159
I heard no longer on the on Cheers

986
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
So in his neck

987
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Clip

988
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Alex is very

989
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
Few friends left

990
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,815
In the media

991
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Do people even just doesn't

992
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Yeah yeah one of them

993
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,215
Lou Dobbs short hair like Lou Dobbs alright

994
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Fursona play

995
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
Sidney Powell Lou Dobbs

996
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
Ameresco card

997
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
And this is very very poor

998
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Michigan place to start

999
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,783
We're going to play this clip and we'll be right back

1000
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,087
So the long and short of this is that there's a

1001
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,183
Conspiracy going around there's a super-secret overpowered computer called hammer

1002
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,231
They can run a program called

1003
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Scorecard

1004
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,815
Which was used to manipulate and change the results of this Alexa

1005
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,167
This desperate and absurd conspiracies being sold by people like Gaston

1006
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,007
Steve Bannon show Mike Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell and Lou.

1007
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:17,919
Either high-profile people in right-wing Spears this just isn't like some Fringe completely online nonsense I was wondering

1008
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Where did this come from

1009
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
Luckily I did not

1010
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Have to look too far

1011
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
Will summer Over The Daily Beast it already put together a great piece about how all the claims about the supercomputer and the program come for me

1012
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Single source

1013
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,743
And someone who I have a special bond with

1014
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,863
This all comes from Dennis Montgomery dammit

1015
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,471
Talking damn I was amazed

1016
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,079
Call back in the reality his name come up again

1017
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
It would take far too long to get into this right now but back on March 2017 on the 25th episode of Art

1018
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Podcast we dedicated

1019
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,087
Two and a half hours to Dennis Montgomery and his various frauds

1020
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,183
Why you don't need to take anything that raises back to him seriously

1021
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,791
Go ahead and check that episode at my God so Wills article on it is a really good break down to

1022
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
This is how these dicks work

1023
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:14,239
Supposedly respectable outlets on the right or so desperate for a big overarching explanation for how they were screwed in the election

1024
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,591
They're willing to amplify and give credibility to claims being made by a career con man

1025
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,687
Who's the lawyer is Larry f****** claiming you can't do it

1026
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
How is it that

1027
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Even in this way

1028
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
People don't

1029
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Oh it's Larry klayman

1030
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
The fuckout

1031
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,975
Like Larry klayman Larry claim with coming for you eventually

1032
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:41,375
Like it doesn't matter what if you're on the hard right it doesn't matter sooner or later lyric luminous Larry claim is going to sue you

1033
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
Everywhere

1034
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,727
Don't listen to him now

1035
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:52,895
You didn't need to worry about the lawsuits just look at em look at look at those

1036
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Yeah

1037
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Pass

1038
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,527
You could have the biggest scoop in the world

1039
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,855
I'm going to take the hit if you're right this time

1040
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:07,743
I'm going to just bite the bullet and say I don't trust anything you say and if that bites me in the ass

1041
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
I still did the right thing

1042
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
The idea that you might like

1043
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,631
James O'Keefe video pop up in

1044
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
Well maybe you got it right this time

1045
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
No no

1046
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
That's bad that's bad thing

1047
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,639
So it is next Alex like I said he's kind of interested in these ideas about to

1048
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,199
Millions of people showing up at the White House truck

1049
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:33,599
Also he doesn't like that the media is downplaying the number of people that are coming to Owen Shroyer's rally

1050
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,183
In Austin is very preoccupied

1051
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,767
A lot of time over. Crowd sizes in Austin

1052
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559

00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
Right now let's go ahead and play

1091
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
Ali Alexander

1092
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
The capital

1093
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
And then I want to show

1094
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Veritas

1095
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Fairness

1096
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
I'm not throwing a fit

1097
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
I need to see this

1098
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
Yeah I don't know

1099
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
I don't know

1100
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:36,735
He doesn't go to rebroadcast whoever he's at whatever intern he's hired was able to pull that up before

1101
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,807
The pot bubbled over

1102
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:44,671
Do spend a lot more time than this even on just like the crowd size

1103
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Pictures inside

1104
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Exactly the same as

1105
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
After the 2016 election

1106
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
Is just

1107
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Just a

1108
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
The funhouse mirror version of

1109
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:58,239
We did the election we talked about fraud we talked about complaining about

1110
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
Different claims about

1111
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Crowd sizes

1112
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Just did

1113
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:08,735
Guy lost this time exactly almost beat for be just with a different angle

1114
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Can't believe that they're going

1115
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Like it's not going to

1116
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,183
Every other year during election season

1117
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,231
Alex is going to scream about how it's

1118
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
The devil

1119
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,559
And then every other year he's going to be like

1120
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
Well

1121
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
I know we lost but

1122
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
We got a path through this

1123
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
And it's never going to

1124
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:32,287
To stop they were always be convinced that it's the devil will always be convinced that it

1125
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,823
It's fine that the devil 12

1126
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,919
It is keep going

1127
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,223
It does seem like that would be just how things

1128
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Yeah that's just how it operates

1129
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:47,135
Yeah and then just come up with fun interesting stuff to say about whatever headlines

1130
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,951
Auntie didn't read the articles of

1131
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:54,303
How disappointing would have disappointed you think God is that they're like

1132
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
We only fight against

1133
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
The devil in an

1134
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:02,751
Sitting here come on until we fight against the devil's assistant during the midterm

1135
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:09,151
Yeah yeah exactly

1136
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,455
Later otherwise you burn yourself out and if

1137
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Supernanny

1138
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,623
Preoccupied at these crowd pictures and

1139
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
Could not

1140
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
Find myself

1141
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Giving a s*** out

1142
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
And I understand

1143
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
Turning off this episode

1144
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,327
This Saturday episode

1145
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
Boring

1146
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
It is so much just like

1147
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,495
Over and over again Ramblin repetitious the election was stolen

1148
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,543
But it also was really

1149
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,127
Uninspired like here's a little clip that just sort of sums up

1150
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
Kind of how I feel that way

1151
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
They just stole this bigger Dallas

1152
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,759
Right out the oven

1153
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
About stealing stuff

1154
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
Tanaka cat

1155
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
We're going to get the tools

1156
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
There was no cat

1157
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,743
Burglar and going on here ladies and gentlemen

1158
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
This was

1159
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Done

1160
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
I'll be open

1161
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,655
There's a feeling of resignation almost

1162
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,471
To the fact that I stole it we've proven it

1163
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
When are you going to do

1164
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823
And I don't understand that

1165
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
No no no I mean I

1166
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,943
Standard if you don't actually believe any of it

1167
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,551
Beyond perfect

1168
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
Especially if

1169
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,903
You've made your last entire year-and-a-half

1170
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,999
Referendum on whether or not the tree of Liberty does

1171
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
To be watered with the blood of tyrants from time to time

1172
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
Apparently

1173
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
I guess not this

1174
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
Year it's been

1175
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,727
Abundantly clear what his position on that is

1176
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,799
Drink that you don't go back from that so

1177
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:47,199
We have this situation where where you know in this. After the election where it's the 79 days of hell

1178
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,759
Call Aaron Biden is the president election

1179
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,295
Alex sitting Trump hasn't

1180
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Conceited and Alex doesn't know what

1181
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
He's going to

1182
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
I find it to be like

1183
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
What are the most

1184
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Important

1185
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,255
It's for us to be like really tracking

1186
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
What are the moves

1187
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:05,375
What are the things he does and I found this Saturday to be just

1188
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Almost done listenable

1189
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,935
It's just

1190
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
Banging the gong over and over again Alexa

1191
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
She was stolen treading water

1192
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
Yeah but putting water

1193
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
Boring yeah yeah

1194
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
And so I needed

1195
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
Jump into Sunday

1196
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
I like you to sense

1197
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Something

1198
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
I really feel like Alex

1199
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
Didn't do it for me at the beginning of the show

1200
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,951
I can tell you as bad as it is we're going to come through this stronger

1201
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
The other side no matter what

1202
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,559
The devil is killing us all

1203
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,655
I wish we could bypass was coming

1204
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
Wish we could have gone around this

1205
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Which could have an easy Landing

1206
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Michelle

1207
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,895
20%

1208
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Action

1209
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
20% chance

1210
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,623
Winning I guess I got an election and then 100% chance of everything going cool if Trump seizes power

1211
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
But that would be a hundred percent chance

1212
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
I don't know

1213
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
2020 Acura 50/50

1214
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,399
A hundred percent chances of Alex getting ready watch

1215
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:17,055
He wants in the form of trump staying in power and then Trump.

1216
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,615
Not being in office worker up to

1217
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,431
Unilaterally declare itself a dictator

1218
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Yeah

1219
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:30,879
But that is only 79 more days ahead

1220
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
A lot of

1221
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
Preparation

1222
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,279
No sitting around thing like what is he trying to say here yours a lot of that

1223
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,351
It's all right I'm accustomed to stretches of

1224
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Intense

1225
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
Mental exertion

1226
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Alex

1227
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
PS2

1228
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
I brainstorm so hard this morning

1229
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
For about 6 a.m. to about

1230
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
12:00 noon. The office

1231
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
That

1232
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
Completely exhausted

1233
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
Okay

1234
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,439
Alright thinking is hard that's fair

1235
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
I left and I told everybody to kill everybody but now

1236
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,375
I think that's a bad idea so what's my next move power nap

1237
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Power nap

1238
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,471
Seized power nap alright I know what to talk about

1239
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:22,335
About today you know I think there's a new thread that I hope will go on throughout the podcast is Alex

1240
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:26,431
Reverting to dream space for his

1241
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
Define bee answers

1242
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:35,647
Yeah Alex becoming sort of like the shaman of the the right-wing extremist world

1243
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:42,047
Jared Daniel who's going to interpret his dreams more of and then we've got this all couches

1244
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
I was not going to do s*** but

1245
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
About his family's breakfast time

1246
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
This morning

1247
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Disturbing

1248
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
Well this morning I talked to my oldest daughter and my wife at breakfast with my three-year-old daughter played

1249
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,551
Toy cars in blocks on the floor both what was happening

1250
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
Well if my oldest daughter

1251
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,671
Finish my sentences before I

1252
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
31

1253
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
Already we understand

1254
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,887
It was a very good feeling a feeling of strength

1255
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
I never went a bottom

1256
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,591
They've been listening and they've been showing

1257
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
My oldest daughter Charlotte to me she said

1258
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
Almost always right

1259
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
Voltaire cannot ride

1260
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
So much to be

1261
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Animus speech

1262
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Twilight out the future

1263
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Stop

1264
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,583
Coming back today I understood

1265
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,959
You just imagine like he's sitting around with like some granola

1266
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
This is a dinner conversation

1267
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,223
These kids are too young for coffee you can't handle Alex Jones predict

1268
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,527
In the future without a little caffeine

1269
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,807
Yeah that's not fair

1270
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
Let him get through the more DeGraw I got to deal with the Apocalypse

1271
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
In the morning

1272
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,487
I definitely not I don't know why but that mental image

1273
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,351
Used to bees in the real world disturbing hilarious

1274
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:24,191
Funny so funny man and the worst part is you're the worst

1275
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
For me

1276
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
The kids

1277
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
Don't know

1278
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Something that's

1279
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,871
Fundamentally true that would change everything about their outlook on life

1280
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
Meister dad is Alex Jones

1281
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
They're going to be

1282
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
They're going to

1283
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Continue to be rich

1284
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,319
They're going to continue to be taken care of

1285
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
They're going to continue doing everything

1286
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
With

1287
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
No changes at all

1288
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Well none

1289
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Yeah

1290
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
I mean I guess

1291
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,583
I would say they're going to be fine in many material ways

1292
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:57,983
They're not going to be fine with that emotionally

1293
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,031
It's if you just sat him down a bit like listen

1294
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
I am

1295
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Always lying

1296
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
We're going to be fine

1297
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:11,039
Don't worry why are you crying there's no need to cry where riches s*** we don't actually get the tear in her eye

1298
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:15,647
You're almost always right doesn't sound like something and someone else says it sounds like

1299
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,975
Alex writing dialogue for Imaginary characters

1300
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
But seem like that

1301
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Anyway

1302
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
I would be

1303
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,375
More upset with him telling a story about preparing his

1304
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Children and his wife for the coming

1305
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
Tribulation or whatever the f***

1306
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
If he didn't

1307
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
Have really good reason

1308
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
Disrespect

1309
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
That there

1310
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
Is

1311
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Corruption

1312
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,991
Sure in the election sure and one of the pieces of evidence he brings to the table is I mean

1313
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
I'm convinced

1314
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,135
Google.com

1315
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Google

1316
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
FedEx

1317
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,535
Record search in the days before the election

1318
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
And the days after the election

1319
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
No one ever searches

1320
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
What is the penalty

1321
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,031
The one of the searches and what is the consequences

1322
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
And what is the

1323
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,103
Prison time and what is the jail time

1324
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,407
Peter searches no one's ever done

1325
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Pushpay

1326

1327

1328

In Minnesota

1329
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
In Wisconsin

1330
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
In Michigan

1331
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,047
The search was

1332
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
4

1333
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
What is the consequences what is the penalty

1334
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
What is the prison

1335
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Sometime

1336
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
For election fraud

1337
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,031
Wow that's election officials in fraud

1338
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Not Butter

1339
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,735
Scroll up Google Trends searches for Aladdin fries

1340
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
In the key Battleground States

1341
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,319
Morton

1342
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Fattest people

1343
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
Checking to see

1344
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
What's going to happen to them

1345
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,047
What a conclusion he's a big jump

1346
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,399
So you're saying that people are Googling a crime there about

1347
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:07,263
To commit

1348
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
Oh my God

1349
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
You don't think it might have something to do with maybe right-wing people constantly hoping retribution will come to their and amazing

1350
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,551
That there's some sort of punishment

1351
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
Discover that will be War

1352
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,415
Open death silly friend this is a forensic fingerprint that proves

1353
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:29,023
Election officials are

1354
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,119
What up what a good thinker

1355
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
I think I'm impressed by him

1356
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
If that's the result of is brainstorming

1357
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:44,639
For 6 hours take a nap cuz you probably have

1358
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,199
Analytical abilities

1359
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
So Alex is something in this next clip that I

1360
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
I found really interesting answer

1361
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,343
Example of like how

1362
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
There's sort of a dark mirror

1363
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,951
Version of real world

1364
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,279
Things that are often times behind his rhetoric

1365
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Come back from break I'm going to

1366
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,935
What they're saying the president inside the house right now

1367
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
Concede

1368
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,735
I blame him for the covid-19 deaths

1369
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,599
Therma set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission supporters

1370
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
And they're going to make the lockdown

1371
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
Economy Tent

1372
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
Obiden

1373
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
So I find this kind of Interest

1374
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,703
I don't know if I disagree too much with Alex's assessment of things that could happen if Trump concedes inviting because

1375
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Comes president

1376
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
I just think that he's

1377
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,311
Portraying these things false light

1378
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,943
Percy says that they'll blame Trump for the covid-19 deaths and to the extent that anyone should be blamed

1379
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,271
It probably should be the executive officer the country was in a position

1380
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
To make decisions that he failed to make

1381
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
Obviously no one would say that it's

1382
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,439
All Trump's fault but the conversation about policy failures

1383
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,023
Hindu information about what was known when and what was ignored

1384
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Would almost certainly paint Trump

1385
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,583
But a terrible light

1386
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,143
Especially if he's staked his entire repartee

1387
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,423
Reputation on being

1388
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
A perfect

1389
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
Chief executive officer

1390
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:20,127
You could easily see someone like Alex experiencing a harsh sober look at Trump's virus response as the

1391
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
The globalist blaming him for all the deaths

1392
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
So that might

1393
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,503
Actually be a fair assessment

1394
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
Just the requested mirror

1395
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
I mean you don't get to take

1396
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Credit for the things

1397
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
That they end then not take blame for the

1398
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
Apparently you do

1399
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
Oh okay nevermind I forgot about that second thing Alex says is that there will be Truth and Reconciliation committee

1400
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
To demonize Trump supporters

1401
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:47,775
This is obviously Alex's way of spinning the inevitable necessity of trying to bring humans in this country back to a place where we can

1402
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
Even communicate with each other

1403
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,639
The fracturing of shared reality is something that needs to be addressed

1404
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
Any attempt to do that is a threat to someone like Alex

1405
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,551
Whose entire business relies on the perpetuation of that false reality

1406
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,439
Attempts by people who aren't in his fantasy world to humbly reach out and reintegrate people who got sucked

1407
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,463
Into the Trump call

1408
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,071
Q ship is obviously going to be painted as communist indoctrination by Alex

1409
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Reconciliation

1410
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,471
His business cannot afford for him to present it any other way. But

1411
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Veep

1412
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
Attempt

1413
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Reaching out and in

1414
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
Having like okay look

1415
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
That s*** was really bad

1416
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
But we need to cut Whitney

1417
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Need to figure out a way to move forward

1418
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,551
That will be what this is

1419
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
The third thing he says that there will be even

1420
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,647
Harsher lockdown

1421
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,743
Now I'm not sure if that's actually the case or Howitzer Define any of those terms

1422
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,303
But I do think that if Biden were to get into office

1423
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Amora.

1424
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,351
Reasonable approach

1425
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,959
Do a Public Health crisis would be enacted it'll be easy for Alex to paint that as

1426
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,495
These harsh Crackdown

1427
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
All of the things that he's describing is

1428
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Trump concede

1429
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,687
Are things that are based on kernels of things that could be real right

1430
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,295
It's just preemptively painting them as these evil nefarious plans

1431
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
Sugar globalist

1432
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
It's how he

1433
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
That's how he gives himself

1434
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
The credibility of having like all these

1435
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,511
That good prediction of the hell

1436
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:18,143
Which I will come upon us in this case because we already have been told

1437
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,703
Bad Ad nauseam what a reasonable response

1438
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
What's would be

1439
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Then we've already not

1440
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,079
Seen it then taking a reasonable response

1441
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,383
Is already in baked into their proper

1442
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
You know like

1443
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
The fact that we

1444
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,295
We didn't take a reasonable response makes a super-smart for killing 200,000 people

1445
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
And if they do take a reasonable response

1446
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Then it's because

1447
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,415
Is there trying to hurt our economy

1448
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
It's just

1449
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,999
Yeah they've already already one that messaging

1450
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,839
On this Sunday I kind of

1451
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863

Countdown to the Caravan putting

1483
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:18,975
Well I mean Caravan is also an unfortunate term for them to use cuz the right-wing was all obsessed with the Caravans coming from south

1484
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,279
Porter shorts

1485
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095

1486
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119

What were the running moonshine

1494
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,839
You're right it should be it should be a cowboy

1495
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
And they could

1496
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:01,471
That's why the hard-right sucks at everything they could even get Convoy

1497
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,799
If Alex really wanted to put some money into this

1498
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:10,687
He could hire kellyanne Conway to run the kellyanne Conway Kansai

1499
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,271
It could work I I like it

1500
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
Alliteration

1501
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
You should guide all choices

1502
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Yes

1503
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623

Really came into Infowars by yelling at people on the street

1511
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:46,271
Micro whose only real value to the organization isn't as somebody who can

1512
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,671
Tell whether Steves full of s*** or not at all

1513
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,975

The potential for like

1524
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Hilarity

1525
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
Unresolved High

1526
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:34,143
For this is this documented

1527
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:40,543
I want the raw footage of this road trip is going to produce a channel

1528
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:46,943

1530
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
I can't tell you like

1531
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,159
I have not I've not been this excited for some dumb idea

1532
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
Stop

1533
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
It's something that's supposed to happen over the course of this week

1534
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
Owen Shroyer is already

1535
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:05,887
Somewhere yes close location

1536
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,983
This is not good I want to bet money on whether or not this makes it

1537
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
I will bet you

1538
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Money right now okay

1539
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
Alex does not make it

1540
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,759
He's going to cancel it

1541
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,927
Charity box

1542
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:35,327
I'm going to win this bet going to be

1543
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,911
Alright

1544
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,447
I feel like

1545
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
The better bat

1546
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,775
Is whether or not Owen make

1547
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:50,431
That's a good question cuz he's actually got a challenge in front of that stripping at all of these

1548
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,807
Alex is just going to fly him saying is if Owen doesn't make it there's no way Alex

1549
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,855
Can save face on that right

1550
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
It would be tough to beat

1551
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,743
It's available whether or not the the presentation be better if Helen doesn't think that's true

1552
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
That is true

1553
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
I don't know

1554
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
Steps to make up some story about him beads

1555
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Stopped

1556
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:15,263
Listen to be good and you look at me well alright now

1557
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
If

1558
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
There were any way for this

1559
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,871
To have been possible

1560
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
I would

1561
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,943
Almost do anything

1562
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
2

1563
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Beyond that

1564
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,551
Like to be a Hunter S Thompson.

1565
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,343
Like a look I don't like you guys

1566
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:35,743
But I want to do some Gonzo journalism alright I'm on this bus with Owen I'll stay out of your way I'm not going to f*** with anything

1567
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:41,887
Just to be able to record this for history should be filmed

1568
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:47,007
Time this should be a road trip documentary and we should have the final

1569
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,799
This should be the new Cannonball Run

1570
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,711
Now

1571
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
Jordan

1572
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:03,903
Norcold open I have to I have to I have to punch this up

1573
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Owen

1574
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,279
Is down there he's got to get to the DC through all these stops

1575
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
Antifa

1576
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:16,703
Is rare and they have to get to The Oregon Territory

1577
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:23,103
Of course he's going on

1578
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:31,295
There's got to be somebody who's Dastardly and a dog that laughs these are the things I know about the wacky race

1579
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,599
Ants and one car that's like

1580
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
They're drunk

1581
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
We're not going to show their drinking characters who are drunks

1582
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,863
We're not showing this for legal reasons

1583
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,495
So anyway you can tell I'm very excited about this exciting new development

1584
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:57,151
Is the first time I've been really excited about something if it was done as a little while I do think there is the potential for this to go real

1585
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Really bad

1586
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
Because I think a lot of

1587
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:05,599
The people who might be drawn to that wedding philant and certainly I hope that's not the case

1588
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,367
I'm excited

1589
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:12,767
I'm excited for Owen tripping over his own foot all the way up the Eastern seaboard

1590
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:17,375
Imagine if Paul Revere had like a two-legged horse

1591
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
That's what we're dealing with here

1592
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
So Alex gets to talk

1593
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
Alexander

1594
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
He comes on

1595
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,359
And they're just trying to get Trump not to concede

1596
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
It's so proud

1597
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,407
Qawwali

1598
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Tonight

1599
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Get the

1600
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
To concede because the cavalry's coming

1601
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,831
Evidence of fraud is mounting massive

1602
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
We know that the Press

1603
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,951
Resident is watching these broadcast and so I want to see mr.

1604
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
President

1605
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,999
The calvary is

1606
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
Coming

1607
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,327
Calvary and Cavalry coming

1608
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,423
Gray Cavalry for the guys who like

1609
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,239
The Bible figure it out

1610
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:59,103
We have seen Alexander really coming

1611
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,151
Into his own as a real

1612
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:05,759
Feel like Hardline real religious Traditions la

1613
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
So maybe he is actually saying caliper

1614
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Put you up there

1615
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
So if

1616
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
The election

1617
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
Is to be believed

1618
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
By that you know

1619
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
All the source

1620
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Reality

1621
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
And even if that's the case Trump should still

1622
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
Kobe Bryant that's great

1623
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,311
We have a right to not let him be president

1624
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,967
We've got incredible evidence

1625
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
We've got

1626
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,295
Damning evidence we've got him dead

1627
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
How to write

1628
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:45,183
I mean like why even do the election that based on what you're saying pretty much

1629
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,511
You're saying that the person is disqualified so I guess

1630
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
Why was

1631
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:53,375
Your argument I mean why wasn't there a position of

1632
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,191
F*** this election we shouldn't even do it

1633
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Instead of

1634
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:02,335
Let's do the election the Democrats are going to try and steal it and Trump will win by a landslide

1635
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
I don't understand

1636
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
The cell that with the only way that it's

1637
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:10,015
The fair election is if Trump wins so what are the election because if he doesn't

1638
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
Let's just not do the

1639
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
I didn't expect that

1640
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,399
I think that's another thing that they're they're not able to comprehend

1641
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
How stupid it makes them look right

1642
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
Okay so you're saying

1643
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
Trump had no like it's all

1644
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Fake evidence

1645
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
None of it's real bad no evidence for the Russian

1646
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
We saw a lot of

1647
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,455
Yeah and for very

1648
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
Sources all over

1649
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
But you're right

1650
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
So if that's manufactured

1651
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
That's well

1652
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Quite

1653
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
Currently

1654
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,415
Trump is

1655
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
Proving that bite

1656
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
Install the election

1657
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:56,863
We have very little evidence while we have Rudy Giuliani Etta landscaping place

1658
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:03,519
Cecil they're even admitting that they're taking evidence

1659
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,567
Dennis Montgomery

1660
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Alright

1661
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,687
Hold your horses

1662
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,223
Google Google

1663
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:18,623
I bet you that's true true

1664
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:22,207
Please get one person like a like a Michael Flynn or Michael Cohen to like

1665
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,279
Flipped Forum just for a little

1666
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,167
Pumping out the dentist Montgomery GI but from the other side you know they got to get a Bugatti in trap

1667
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
Someone

1668
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,007
I have them like turn Rogue or whatever

1669
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:38,335
I think it would they really want though

1670
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
We've been

1671
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,175
Kind of aware of Shar-Peis

1672
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,247
Forgot to seize power and is to be Christian theocracy

1673
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,807
And always a little bit too open about

1674
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Pervert and they're seeking to you and I have talked

1675
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
Invert

1676
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,183
Invert

1677
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
All of these holy orders that we have

1678
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,815
Christianity stabilize this

1679
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,911
Of of what Rome had no after it burned in all this

1680
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,447
Christian be injected

1681
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
Into

1682
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
Western Civilization

1683
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,615
Stabilizing formula for workout

1684
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,663
Exactly so

1685
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,991
The basis of what we call Western Civilization now is Chris

1686
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
Christianity because

1687
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
Prior Western Civilization didn't work

1688
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:26,207
Oh so whenever you talk about like Western Civilization being what you're all about your actually just talking about like

1689
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
I don't know a Christian

1690
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
Religious state

1691
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,167
I'm glad we can have that in the clear now

1692
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:40,287
It is kind of see it is kind of out being mean again

1693
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
That's really their only option

1694
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,639
If they guess they can't even really lie about the

1695
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Open results

1696
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Cuz nobody's buying it

1697
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
Except for everybody that they like

1698
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
Your only option

1699
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,855
And then just an out-and-out be like

1700
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,671
Well in order to save the Republic we have to

1701
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
Become a Christian theocracy

1702
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,583
Yeah I think that that's sort of the the underlying Trend that you see from

1703
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,887
People like Ali obviously

1704
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,191
And a little bit on Infowars

1705
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,519
Actually the sense that I got from this Sunday episode was

1706
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
Very much not

1707
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,896
That interested in the election fraud stuff anymore

1708
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,920
Like

1709
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:22,272
Kind of it it seems like we proved it and he has stuff like this that happened but

1710
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,320
Is focus seems to be elsewhere

1711
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
2 months ago saying

1712
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,696
We got the most people ever for election fraud

1713
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:33,792
Pelosi we can have enough saying I don't care what happens to this thing coming up

1714
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
He'll be inaugurated after

1715
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,984
There was one thing criminals do they love to brag

1716
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,824
Anthony over here

1717
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Secondly

1718
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,664
We're in a situation where we have put

1719
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
Together

1720
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:56,064
And you'd guys did did it did it for our administrative President Obama's administration

1721
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
Before this

1722
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
We put together

1723
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
I think

1724
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
The most

1725
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
Extensions

1726
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
And inclusive

1727
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
Voter fraud

1728
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Organization

1729
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,888
In history of American pilot

1730
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
But we are ready

1731
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,312
I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president

1732
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
On Tuesday

1733
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Forever

1734
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
End

1735
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,200
Count is

1736
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
But

1737
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,832
On the election that occurs on Tuesday he will be elected on January 20th he will be

1738
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
Inaugurated president of the United States

1739
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,512
She's the one that does the salon that's going bankrupt

1740
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,816
Damascus

1741
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,168
I find that like

1742
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
Clip was

1743
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:51,104
Useless I don't think I didn't hear anything in there that was even like

1744
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Suspicious

1745
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,944
No I think he's just trying to pass off

1746
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,736
Confidence as

1747
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
Knowledge

1748
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:04,672
Perhaps but I think even he recognized I was so weak that he had to complain about the

1749
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
Salon

1750
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,744
Anything that's in the club

1751
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,048
Sounds a little worse

1752
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:16,448
And if you think that he was just speaking a man accidentally said that they put together a voter fraud organization

1753
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
The conclusion that Alex is presenting

1754
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
However that's not Biden misspeaking

1755
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,640
It's a clip taken from an interview on pod save America for back in October

1756
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:30,016
In reality if the person who found that clip it allowed it to play in full movie pain Play album

1757
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,832
Was talking about organizing to stop and avoid

1758
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,112
Instances of voter fraud

1759
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,928
But honestly that's not the best word that he could have used

1760
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,256
What he was referring to as more of a broad-spectrum voter disa

1761
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
Enfranchise

1762
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,840
Immediately after the clip stops by and goes on to

1763
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:50,240
Discuss be calling line that have been set up to connect people with lawyers who can help if they have trouble voting or face intimidation at the polls

1764
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,080
These are the sorts of specific talents has because it's about appearances

1765
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
It's not reality

1766
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,944
Eclipse sounds really bad like buying was accidentally admitting to setting up a

1767
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,480
Voter fraud organization

1768
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,552
But it only does if you only listen to that little snippet

1769
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,672
Facade doesn't Publix

1770
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,464
What you doing Matt restorative

1771
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,256
Not talk about it that much

1772
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,304
I think he wants to talk about that

1773
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,656
What's dark but this goddamn

1774
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,216
He also has an emergency message

1775
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:28,128
Emergency message

1776
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,968
Coming out the bottom of the hour

1777
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:35,808
Who got that message coming up and I think that's really where you want

1778
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
This do you wants to put his Focus

1779
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
Sure sure sure we'll get to that in a minute

1780
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Because his Focus

1781
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,208
Is never far

1782
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
From one person

1783
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
One person in this world

1784
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Hans

1785
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
Alex like a wheel

1786
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,168
Showmars

1787
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,728
Preparing to remove

1788
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,544
Kamala Harris will probably bring Hillary Clinton

1789
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,944
What a time to be alive

1790
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,808
I mean if you want

1791
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,112
Millions of people outside the White House

1792
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:16,000
Trick everyone into getting Hillary Clinton become president now be vice-president then and then

1793
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:20,096
Kamala Harris

1794
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,888
Xeno constitutional Steph

1795
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,448
So this is where I got

1796
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,312
You know I've already I think I think based on our Behavior so far you can already tell I'm super

1797
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,360
Excited about this complex

1798
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,408
Now here's where I got real excited

1799
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,480
You're coming in here lied

1800
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,016
Live

1801
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,320
Strong

1802
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:48,256
4 day trip to DC

1803
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:52,608
Send a message to the globalist that they are in deep trouble

1804
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:59,008
March on DC it's here when the chips are down

1805
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,592
You going to do now State weather

1806
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,384
I felt challenged

1807
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,480
And I realized

1808
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,808
We're going to join that Caravan 00

1809
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,856
We have to do an episode on Friday

1810
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,744
At this is if there ever was an emergency episode necessary

1811
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,840
The Caravans the only thing I care about now it's the only thing I can

1812
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
Because Gina what

1813
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
I think that's going to be fun

1814
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
Yeah I think that's going to be fun for us I even think it's going to be fun for Owen and all the people in the Caravan

1815
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,128
Temporarily forgotten about Assassin's Creed

1816
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,432
Because this Caravan is accepted

1817
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:42,528
Now I kind of want to do a caravan

1818
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,600
Yeah you almost like you can just Envision in your head like

1819
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:50,208
Sad moments of funny music behind it

1820
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,792
It's great so it's not going to be a normal regular thing

1821
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,840
But Caravan necessitates

1822
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:02,240
We got to do an episode on Friday about the Caravan

1823
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,056
That will have to be decided on Friday

1824
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
20 of Caravan nonsense

1825
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,176
I2 to get it when he too

1826
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,248
God it's just going to be a series of banana peels

1827
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
I can't imagine being

1828
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
Alex Diaz videos is emergent

1829
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
MC message coming up

1830
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,928
Heera he throws to

1831
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,840
Okay the videos abandon videos infowars.com Alex Jones does emergency measures of President Trump

1832
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120

1833
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,592
I love you I

1834
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616

Appreciate those that brought you here

1836
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,712
If you decide to spread this video

1837
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,760
Presently

1838
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,808
Here is the report

1839
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,088
I bet if you spread it if

1840
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,368
It still isn't going to

1841
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Now

1842
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,184
I don't know if Trump's going to

1843
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:57,792
See eye-to-eye a lot of shares on that Infowars video I better wake up

1844
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Snap out of it

1845
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,912
Oh man that Infowars video has almost as many likes

1846
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
Is that dumb

1847
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Tweet I just posted

1848
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,104
Did 5 seconds ago I better change all of my thing this is where I got to go

1849
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,896
Do I spell cheated

1850
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:18,272
Buy this because the emergency message that he was teasing I didn't realize it was a pre-recorded video

1851
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,576
You just did this week and leave half an hour early

1852
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
He just lets

1853
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,440
Yeah

1854
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,720
But you know

1855
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
He has an emergency message

1856
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,560
So we better find out what it is

1857
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
President-trump

1858
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
The approach

1859
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,192
Joe Biden and his new

1860
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,472
King Commission

1861
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
They're going to tell

1862
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,544
You're going to be blamed

1863
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
How's the death

1864
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,128
How much do you sign onto a new lockdown

1865
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,664
Contact tracing

1866
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
But even people being

1867
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,504
From their homes and forced inoculate

1868
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296
When you sign on

1869
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Covid-19

1870
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,904
Legitimizing

1871
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,928
The martial law

1872
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,464
This country

1873
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,744
I'm a complete shutdown

1874
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Will be

1875
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
You sir

1876
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,032
You're going to be approached by

1877
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,688
At midnight you will be visited by

1878
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,712
Team Ghost

1879
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:23,552
The 4th will give you an envelope as the location

1880
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,368
Come on man

1881
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
What are we doing

1882
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,280
Alright this is kind of what I think Alex wants to turn this into a as opposed to worrying too much about like

1883
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:36,352
Voter fraud or whatever it's feels just dead

1884
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,168
Deflated even on Alex's show

1885
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,960
What do you wants to talk about is

1886
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,752
During the 79 days of hell

1887
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,568
Bright Biden and his transition team

1888
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,128
We're going to have some ideas about better ways to address

1889
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:52,224
Covid-19 situation sure the real conspiracy is

1890
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,504
Is there going to make

1891
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,576
Bucking demand

1892
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:01,440
Bored with their globalist plant

1893
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,720
If they if he doesn't

1894
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,536
Then they're going to blame the deaths on him

1895
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
He does

1896
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
Then are going to blame the damage

1897
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,168
The economy that their evil plans do during play baton Trump

1898
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,984
He has that situation except to come out

1899
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
Say go fuc

1900
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:21,152
Yourselves globalist but then even if they do that they're going to try and use the 25th Amendment to take him out of office

1901
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:27,040
Sure really much more exciting then yeah

1902
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:32,160
Very very boring voter fraud claims that Dennis Montgomery's pedaling

1903
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
You think that

1904
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,232
That press conference

1905
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Should taken in

1906
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
Higher party down

1907
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,960
That's how sad that was yeah wanted to laugh at it because it's may be objectively the funnies

1908
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,752
This thing I've ever heard

1909
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Yeah it was

1910
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:54,176
Using Leaf everything about it I thought about it is everybody who

1911
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:58,016
Who is like oh, he's going to be good under the Trump Administration

1912
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
And I'm like

1913
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,648
Every single thing I've seen of people trying to dunk on this

1914
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,184
Is not as funny

1915
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,464
And never will be

1916
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,488
As if mirax

1917
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
Like you're never going to win there's no

1918
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:16,448
Point in trying, d.c. standing next to a pawn shop

1919
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
With a f******

1920
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,264
Pedophile right next to a

1921
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
It just doesn't get better than that

1922
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,592
There's no joke

1923
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,128
That is better than that

1924
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:28,736
And landscaping place also called Four Seasons

1925
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,808
Self is it implied

1926
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,624
Pedophile after the fifteen-year-old girl thing

1927
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,440
Like the whole thing is off the rails

1928
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,232
Joq I have

1929
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
None

1930
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,584
So Alex's message to Trump

1931
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,656
Is largely like you got to talk more s*** man

1932
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
So essential

1933
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
For you now

1934
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
The election

1935
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,312

Command

Just talkin those articles flash up on screen one of them is that article from the scientist

1957
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,480
Oh no

1958
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Right under the headline

1959
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,040
When is an editor's note

1960
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
About Heather

1961
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,344
Conspiracy theories

1962
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
Crack a

1963
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:42,720
Connecting this article to covid-19 for in the coronavirus and now this is all on

1964
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,816
Substantiate even is Alex is trying to show this evidence

1965
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,096
Did he just doesn't work

1966
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
Accidentally

1967
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,704
Checking himself

1968
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,008
So they're going to try and remove Trump

1969
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Is that

1970
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,824
That's what this emergency messages all the time

1971
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,104
Sure

1972
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Irish to know

1973
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,688
What they're planning

1974
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Office

1975
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
Before

1976
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
20th

1977
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,832
Planet

1978
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
Brick Oven

1979
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,672
It's been their plan all along

1980
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,512
Then your legacy

1981
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,048
Supporters

1982
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,840
Will be a revocable econnect

1983
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:20,864
The covid-19

1984
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,680
People will be perfect

1985
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,448
Computed

1986
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,984
Americanism itself

1987
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,264
Will be demonized

1988
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,568
Wuhan virus

1989
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
Which of the Chinese,

1990
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:35,712
I would say that history is not going to be super kind

1991
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
Stu Trump's fans

1992
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,808
No. About their response

1993
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
Wants to

1994
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,368
Do probably not go

1995
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
Going to go well

1996
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:49,536
Don't Trump leaving early no more staying until January

1997
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,840
Imaginary

1998
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,376
Saginaw

1999
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
Just going to look back.

2000
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,448
Weird how

2001
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
Responding poorly to a Public Health crisis

2002
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,800
Seem to be

2003
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,616
Policy plank

2004
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,920
Weird seemed like a good idea

2005
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,760
It's very strange new policy is murder

2006
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,856
They're going to try and use that 25th

2007
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Amendment

2008
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,904
Sure

2009
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,488
You who is still present

2010
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
Election of the Constitution

2011
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
Implementing

2012
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,608
If you do not

2013
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
Mediately agreed

2014
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,680
They're going to say the 206

2015
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
Teapot styles

2016
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
You died from something else

2017
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:31,776
Ronnie

2018
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
Your

2019
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,568
Watch

2020
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,848
Your head

2021
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,896
You are

2022
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,176
Guilty of this

2023
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
The 25th of May

2024
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
I do not

2025
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,040
President of the United States

2026
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,344
Discredit you

2027
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
Election

2028
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,464
Put the certified that Frozen election

2029
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,024
By having your own tablet remove you

2030
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
Under the 25th Amendment

2031
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,840
Because you don't follow

2032
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
The recommendations

2033
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,400
Orders

2034
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
Abigail B

2035
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,704
Do Global Discovery

2036
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,008
I mean what's the point

2037
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
I don't I don't understand

2038
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Why

2039
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,920
I think what's funny about this is that

2040
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
He's

2041
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
Okay

2042
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
In his world

2043
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,576
We live in a

2044
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,392
This is what they would do so we do it

2045
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,232
But they would do what our plans are that we're doing right now

2046
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,024
So

2047
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,840
I think Alex is actually saying that one he knows

2048
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,120
All of this stuff is

2049
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
This is all transfer

2050
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
And

2051
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,544
That's the only way is the best way for us to go about this

2052
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,128
Is to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office

2053
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,224
To do all this stuff early like he's saying that the best plan

2054
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,112
Well that's what he would do

2055
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
In our situation

2056
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:57,792
Right but that's not always still even the best thing to do

2057
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
Does this weekend

2058
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,096
Movies like here is what I would

2059
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,680
And that's what they're trying to do already

2060
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,728
Yeah I hear it more like

2061
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,008
Yeah it's going to look

2062
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,288
Real bad

2063
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
If competent leadership comes in

2064
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,504
And people like oh this is what we've been missing

2065
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,832
Like all the Deep State all these weird

2066
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,416
Weird things that have been going on over the past couple years

2067
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Weird excuses

2068
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
Are all just going to look

2069
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,512
Kind of dumb

2070
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,072
And I think Alex recognizes that

2071
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
And you know

2072
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
Abstract people

2073
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
Create

2074
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
Do something funny

2075
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,752
79 days of hell

2076
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
I have to leave

2077
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,408
Anyway I mean something that scares me

2078
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
Is there's only two ways

2079
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
And that is to

2080
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,808
Step down early

2081
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,832
And have

2082
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
Pence right

2083
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
The most

2084
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,672
Broad pardon

2085
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,976
In the history of the United States

2086
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:02,304
That somehow also supersedes any and all State Crime

2087
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,072
When's the Trump is coming

2088
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Or

2089
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
Not leave

2090
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,680
Because anything other than those

2091
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
2nd going to J

2092
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,496
So

2093
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:16,640
I think he knows that until proven guilty first of all

2094
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
I don't I don't know

2095
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,064
I don't I don't know if that's the case but

2096
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,880
I could easily see some kind of

2097
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,768
Brokered immunity I don't know nothing to to say if

2098
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
He leaves office

2099
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,096
He's going to lose all of her

2100
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Shmoney

2101
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,168
Like it's going to be a bloodbath

2102
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,704
For him personally

2103
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
Because he's bad at everything

2104
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,824
And I think what's going to save us is he's too incompetent

2105
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,384
To do either of the only two things that he

2106
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
Then maybe I don't know I think

2107
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,736
I think we'll see

2108
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,528
I'm not entirely sure

2109
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,088
Alex is presenting

2110
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,648
Drop with this position we're like if

2111
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
You're going to be approached

2112
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,768
Show me is going to tell you Biden secret plan

2113
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
Should you

2114
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:10,400
So you know to this plan they would blame you for all that right

2115
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,448
However if you say yes to it

2116
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Here

2117
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
Is what you got to do

2118
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,264
Are you looking to have

2119
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
If you follow the law.

2120
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,592
Your name

2121
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,152
Homecoming depression in the United States

2122
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,456
Blame you

2123
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,016
All the previous deaths staying later

2124
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
You actually a

2125
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,064
But you were the one

2126
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
You did we have tape

2127
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Scion

2128
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,208
You got come out exposed fauci

2129
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
Bill Gates

2130
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:35,744
Galbi

2131
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
All of them

2132
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,304
Oval Office

2133
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Only

2134
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Stop them

2135
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:45,472
So this is the 20% he was talking about earlier I think

2136
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,776
Is Trump giving

2137
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,848
Oval Office addresses where he spouts Infowars

2138
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,872
Conspiracies

2139
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
I think 20% is a

2140
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,760
Embarrassingly

2141
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,040
Hi

2142
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,600
Chance to give that if successful

2143
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,624
I think

2144
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,416
As far as Alex Goes

2145
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,696
This is a great

2146
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
The Great

2147
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,768
What does good as he can do because

2148
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,304
Trump has nothing left to lose

2149
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,608
And this would be great for Alex's business

2150
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,936
So why not see if trouble do some s*** form now

2151
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,496
I think even Alex has to recognize that that that

2152
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,800
I think fruit list

2153
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,568
Publix

2154
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,616
I do think that this is better

2155
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
For Alex

2156
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:30,784
Then getting too hung up on the election stuff to hung up on

2157
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
F****** like

2158
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:35,392
Even addressing Steve's nonsense like

2159
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,440
It's a better game to play that like

2160
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:41,280
It's really about because then

2161
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
Kind of

2162
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,096
Has a stage remove

2163
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,632
From be like

2164
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:52,032
Strict electoral stuff at parties outside of Paula

2165
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
This is about the globalist evil plan

2166
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,384
You know it and I think that is

2167
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,152
Good

2168
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,712
For him so I think that's why he's Focus

2169
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,016
And this message to the president

2170
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,552
Supposed

2171
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,088
Is not about

2172
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,904
Fight in Michigan fight in Pennsylvania

2173
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,488
Y'all get there to counterbalance right

2174
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,816
Get to Steve pieczenik on the phone he's at the sting operation

2175
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,376
Or whatever you know like not doing that

2176
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
Because

2177
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,192
Sure that you live in the background

2178
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:25,056
But it's proven already yeah yeah we have to go

2179
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,872
Because there's more pressing information exactly

2180
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:31,200
Did Biden's covid response team is really

2181
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,224
A trojan horse

2182
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,528
To get Trump out with the 25th Amendment

2183
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,296
Or

2184
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
Sure

2185
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,904
That's pretty good on his part in terms of spin

2186
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,184
He's playing thing

2187
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,488
Flat night handle Steve pieczenik

2188
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:49,888
Get Owen out of the studio for a while I let me try and f****** thread whatever needle that I need to

2189
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,704
To try and keep us in business after next week

2190
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:59,104
I think that's about as good as you can get any better

2191
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,152
Who is the Beast Aunt out of this camera

2192
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,432
Totally

2193
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:05,248
Now this is a far better plan than I ever would expect

2194
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,784
I don't even know if it's a

2195
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,576
Plan I wonder if it's

2196
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,856
It's just kind of like alright

2197
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,136
What can we do

2198
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
Alright

2199
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
This could work

2200
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:20,096
Yeah I don't know if it's a grand machination or apart or anything

2201
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
Number of the requirement

2202
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,912
B get around some of

2203
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
The problem

2204
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,008
Still not a good play because it's still like

2205
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
I mean

2206
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,104
What happens when the 25th Amendment isn't

2207
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,872
Invoke

2208
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,896
What happens when

2209
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,968
Do you know these votes are certified and and Biden

2210
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:40,064
Is they do need to have the transition team's takeover

2211
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,112
What happens in January

2212
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,392
These are only

2213
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,160
Like

2214
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:50,816
Little Band-Aids you can put on gas there's still a much larger problem isn't being addressed by it right but

2215
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:54,912
In terms of being like Alex Jones or you got to keep moving the shock of Lies

2216
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,216
Toronto truth shock of light

2217
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:59,264
In terms of being that guy

2218
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,288
It is good at

2219
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,592
You could do right now

2220
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,432
I wouldn't be surprised if they half-assed their way into an accidental

2221
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Competent

2222
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,736
Move I don't know if it's

2223
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,088
Albertsons wear green on a curve

2224
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:15,136
Fetster

2225
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,720
I keep reminding myself

2226
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,744
Eating parts of his

2227
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Best Buy

2228
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:26,656
Survival food

2229
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:32,288
It looks like it's made of glass

2230
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,592
It's actually Sugar

2231
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,200
New Cal on my last episode I fall into the desk from

2232
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,736
20 ft above given

2233
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,784
Throwing an elbow drop

2234
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,368
Alex is talking

2235
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,952
Background dressing that Trump won the election and it was stolen

2236
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
President-trump

2237
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Choreograph

2238
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
The approximately blamed

2239
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Covid-19

2240
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,888
The American people not believe it they know the truth

2241
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,168
Feel like you over woman

2242
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,448
Snooze

2243
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:03,264
Election fraud is designed to take you out

2244
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
If you comply

2245
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Give you

2246
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,360
Take the Olive Branch the neocon

2247
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,408
Mitt Romney and George W bush

2248
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
Say okay I'll

2249
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
I'll follow the recommendations

2250
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
The president-elect

2251
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
Showbox

2252
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,040
The lock things down

2253
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
The wear the mask

2254
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,600
Inoculation

2255
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Contact tracers

2256
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,416
Turn around later in

2257
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,208
Admits that you will repudiate

2258
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Your fault

2259
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,536
Gentamicin

2260
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,072
The kitchen of your supporters

2261
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:30,656
So basically Alex is being like for our sake please cease power

2262
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:35,264
I find most interesting about that is that Alex called Biden president-elect

2263
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,032
Yeah I know

2264
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,360
I feel like you would be more Patty than they all know

2265
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,896
I feel like you would be

2266
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,968
That's really weird

2267
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,504
Really strange

2268
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:50,880
I feel like do a second tank I know he's the one take also their cuts

2269
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:57,792
Mispronounce the word

2270
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,816
That's not great

2271
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,584
But

2272
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,864
Even in this message

2273
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,144
That is

2274
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,912
And I like I said

2275
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,472
There's there's this

2276
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,264
It is supposed to be like a message

2277
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,288
Directly to Trump

2278
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:12,384
There's an elephant in the room that Alex can't even ignore in this message

2279
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,944
And that is the Trump is not being a leader

2280
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,248
Waiting for leadership

2281
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
We need the address

2282
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
From the Oval Office

2283
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,088
When you get a reconfirm

2284
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,648
In the face of Fox News never sell out Traders

2285
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
That you are

2286
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
Going to concede

2287
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,488
The fraud and fell out

2288
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,536
Election system in this country

2289
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
We know you're our camping

2290
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,400
So even that it's kind of like a call-out

2291
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
A little bit

2292
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,216
Man I feel so

2293
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,752
Like Joe Rogan and Alex

2294
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,056
Like so many of these people

2295
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
AR

2296
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
Sitting here being like

2297
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
Where's Q

2298
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Where's trout

2299
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,712
Where is all this stuff and it's like guys

2300
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,016
They weren't your friend

2301
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
Yeah they

2302
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,832
You've been using you

2303
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:56,672
You're the fool here I know you can't admit it but that's what

2304
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,256
Got to get you just brought up Joe Rogan's I need to say two things real quick

2305
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
Someone sent me a message

2306
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,936
About Tim Dillon on Joe Rogan show sure they pointed out to me that Tim Dillon is

2307
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Sober

2308
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,104
First recovery or whatever Goshen

2309
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,664
Or smoke we were saying that he was high

2310
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
It was because

2311
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,992
He kept saying he was high

2312
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:27,392
Yeah but I realize it was probably saying is he high like because he's around.

2313
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:31,232
And I misspoke and I apologize about that I didn't mean to imply

2314
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:35,840
Tim was high when he wasn't made that mistake

2315
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,864
Easy easy to make

2316
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,424
Second letter is an a****** without p

2317
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,704
Second

2318
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,496
I think I had this fantasy

2319
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
Rogan

2320
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,824
Ikea and Isaac

2321
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,640
I just rationalize having Alex on my show

2322
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,200
I just started thinking about how fun it would be if you was like

2323
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,808
Forced to have Alex's friends on the show

2324
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,112
Alright

2325
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:01,440
Okay you want Alex on there you got to bring a picture anaconda

2326
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:07,840
Keep chatting with you for a little while if you want to say that this guy sources and s*** are backed up and we got a fact check

2327
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,376
Let's bring

2328
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
Pieczenik right next

2329
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,216
Next episode

2330
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,568
Dance that dance

2331
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,872
I want to do this do it next time

2332
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,920
Today

2333
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:28,832
And now Florida congresswoman elect Laura Loomer

2334
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:34,976
I don't think it's outside possibility to lose my husband on drugs because that doesn't think she has but so either

2335
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:48,032
If you want to have Alex back again

2336
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,312
Is that

2337
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:51,616
Is that Batman appeared from the bushes

2338
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:56,224
What's brings up a headline in his address to

2339
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,296
This is one of his at current talking

2340
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,368
Had

2341
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
UK

2342
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,696
Their secretary

2343
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Their chairman

2344
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280
Are there Joint Chiefs

2345
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,304
Other defects.

2346
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,096
General Sir Nick Carter

2347
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,888
Coming out and saying

2348
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
Lockdown

2349
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,704
The trigger World War 3

2350
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
Another lockdown

2351
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:27,968
So I said line of an article that Alex didn't read about an interview with General Sir Nick Carter on Sky News

2352
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:31,296
Where he discussed how they continuing covid-19 situation and

2353
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,856
Economic ramifications of it

2354
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,208
Around the world has the potential to exacerbate Regional conflicts that already

2355
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
Exist

2356
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:44,352
Many people don't feel like Regional conflicts are too relevant to their lives but Carter was trying to point out the

2357
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:47,936
The quote rhythms of History show to that localized tensions

2358
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,984
Can easily ratchet up and drag Nations

2359
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,752
Store

2360
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:55,104
What are you saying is that regional conflict can off an Escalade when it's miscalculated

2361
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
And ignore

2362
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
He said quote

2363
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,968
If you look back at the last century before both world wars

2364
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:05,600
I think it was an arguable that there was escalating which led to the miscalculated miscalculation

2365
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:08,160
Which ultimately led to war descale we hope

2366
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,184
We never see again

2367
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,768
His comments weren't meant to imply that dealing with covid-19

2368
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,304
To cause a third world war

2369
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,096
And you never said that measure is that Alex

2370
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,424
Exaggerated unnecessary

2371
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,496
That's Oz imagination about what an article he hasn't read

2372
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,544
Says based on his impression of headlight

2373
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:27,616
The interview was given to celebrate remembrance

2374
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:31,200
Sunday ruk day of commemoration for the service person

2375
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,504
Another country who participated in the two World Wars

2376
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,040
Given this context

2377
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:37,856
The General's comments on the interview made a lot more sense

2378
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
But it's exactly

2379
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,928
This context that Alex makes it his job.

2380
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,208
Deprive his audience of

2381
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,560
It's bad enough when the intended audience is some listener who might buy dumb pills

2382
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:49,120
It's another thing when he's imagining that he's calling the

2383
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,144
What does bulshit

2384
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:57,056
It makes total sense this is a remembrance Sunday interview about these world wars

2385
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:59,360
And the concerned it regional conflict

2386
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
Grow in and and golf

2387
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,200

Yeah I mean

2389
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,552
World War 1 was

2390
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,600
Rich guy got killed men a bunch of cows

2391
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,648

Can be amazing beautiful video that I was pre-recorded so he could lie

2414
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:16,416

2419
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:33,312
The message to Trump part is kind of part of the performance to her

2420
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,104
A painfully obvious

2421
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,992
I meant it's just a Larry Miss timed it and he got cut off by the brake how long

2422
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760

2423

54 reason that you need to be getting cut off by the break-in

2431
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,984
The recognition that this is performed

2432
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:06,080
It's art for the audience as it's also an admission that like

2433
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,872
It's not as important as

2434
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:12,480
We don't really care about getting the whole messaging

2435
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,016
The fact that we did it we like

2436
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,064

01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,776
Imagine if your Trump listening to what else
