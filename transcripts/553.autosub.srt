1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was making a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
Scratch that like to sit around

8
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,192
Worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Jordan

10
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
What's up

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
I got a quick question

12
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
1

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Who's the deity worship and to

14
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
My bright spot

15
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
I feel like look

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
I took a lot of beating

17
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
From people about this whole doors

18
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
I do look where is where is straight-up Alex and territory where you immediately started with

19
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Look at look assholes took a lot of pummeling over that perhaps

20
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
I've decided to open myself up to even more criticism

21
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
Walking down the street the other day and I got it in my head that I was like

22
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
I haven't listened to Methods of Mayhem in a long time

23
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
I do did I happen to remember that that exist

24
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,376
Long time

25
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
And let me see how does it hold up bro I listen to three songs

26
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
There was like a shelf it was nice I like it I like it when I was younger I did not

27
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
Kid Rock Beer

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
So I listen to the Kid Rock song

29
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
News

30
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Not good

31
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Also it seems like

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
The theme to The the song

33
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
That is supposed to be about like a noob

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Beginning it in like sort of like finding a new piece sure he's famous for metaphor and not get the memo

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
Universe has nothing to do with this

36
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Listen to was getting naked

37
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
And that song is embarrassed

38
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
I do here that's your response but it's more embarrassing even then that like what you're how you're responding

39
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
You would still be like

40
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
Oh my God

41
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
No plans

42
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
It's gross

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
Weird

44
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
Find somebody who's all kind of Ian sex positive I think everybody

45
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Is that how creepy no no that would be

46
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
Current kind of embarrassing uncomfortable

47
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Now is just rude

48
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
There's a song on there called a proposition

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
F*** you

50
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:44,768
I think that one was actually that actually holds up

51
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Black Blade prop 21 one of the boys in blue running up on crew you know what to do

52
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
Alright well

53
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Now I understand

54
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
That you previously you said that this song

55
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Was good

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
I think it holds up and then you just said we a little bit of

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Haha

58
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Strongly

59
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,536
Two different icy I feel like it's I'm sure it wasn't intended as

60
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Satire of

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
Of political outrage

62
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Expression of like

63
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Some kind of I don't know if

64
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,335
There wasn't a greater statement other than f*** you whenever we were off for three Graves

65
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
It's the machine

66
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
It works on that level

67
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Methods of Mayhem

68
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
Well I have a hard time

69
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,879
With this as my bright spot because it is going to be unrevealed but

70
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
I have completed a new

71
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
Oh Great Gatsby Arapahoe time.

72
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Will be a s******* with Tommy Lee

73
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
And yeah I'm very excited about it it's it's a whole new thing for me it's something that I've wanted to try

74
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Driver long time and I finally stepped down

75
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
I'm excited about this project as well

76
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,855
Now that I know that you're also involve more work

77
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
This will be almost a complete reversal of Fortune.

78
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Little bit for the listeners inasmuch as it is like a

79
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
Huge huge teeth layoffs will be great I hope so

80
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Bright spots

81
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Score

82
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199

Be first I think you said to work faster

85
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
I wanted to do for this episode was

86
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,327
But I got kind of caught up in some of the Alex stuff

87
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
At the beginning of the week

88
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Sure and I didn't want to get mixed up with the

89
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
Giuliani got raided

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
Kind of news of the end of the week or I thought like it would all be too much to cover in one

91
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
So the end of the week will cover on Monday again we're going to cover today

92
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Breaking news

93
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599

00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
Myself on the computer

Facing our neighbors dad

Information

160
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
And here's the

161
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Equation

162
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
If we don't have a

163
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Total away

164
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
They call a post-human world

165
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Then we don't have any shot

166
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Understand the process of industrialization

167
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
It's in the process of modernization

168
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
Boise

169
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Ignorant

170
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Okay Unabomber.

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Each generation going forward

172
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Obvious is less human

173
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Let me tell you about

174
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,159
The force of modernity has Nigeria saleski

175
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Each generation Subs

176
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
Squint believe will be less because of

177
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Computers unsurprisingly

178
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Alex is that guy at a party

179
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Listen imma look

180
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
I'm not saying that the Unabomber was good

181
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
But if you've read his Manifesto I'm not saying he was wrong

182
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
He's got some stuff to say

183
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
You got to be smart to do that that guy at a party is a bummer that guy not

184
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
At a party also about

185
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
What's the

186
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Let's remind ourselves

187
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Movies about a weird mood

188
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Unabomber is a weird mood yeah

189
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,095
We heard on our present-day episode Bill Maher

190
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
It was quite a shift

191
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Purple

192
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
He really got

193
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
An upgrade from

194
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Ventriloquist dummy with the globalist

195
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Basically Tucker Carlson

196
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Here's the other reason that I know for a fact

197
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Alex is a huge fan of Star Wars

198
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
Retconning is his mate raison d'etre

199
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
A name anyways the man apps

200
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
Absolutely refuses to stick to Canon

201
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah that is true it's especially when things are

202
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Repeat in my world

203
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
I have better news

204
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
We are back

205
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
To Bill Maher being off

206
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
I got the point

207
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Where I can't watch

208
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
A CNN P3 would have Bill Maher piece or any of these

209
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
Propaganda pieces because I see the riding that's involved in it

210
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
I see the multi-layered

211
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
Deceptions that are involved the level of

212
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Panda

213
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
I've gotten even more sophisticated

214
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
These are very skilled

215
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Very distraught

216
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
People doing this today there's something

217
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Run for Bill Barr

218
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Almost less than an hour

219
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Work so stupid

220
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
What's that's good news

221
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
That's good news

222
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Dalton

223
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Being man

224
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
Alright

225
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
But I can't watch it

226
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Because the secret Patriot is to seek

227
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
In the circumstances

228
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Yeah or maybe you just talk

229
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,431
You said the other day when he's like I've heard from the higher-ups kind of like Tucker he's a good guy

230
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
There's good news in the world

231
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
Amidst Alex's inability to watch news anywhere sure

232
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Yeah there's also a lot of positive things

233
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Weis

234
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Igor reaction

235
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
But I

236
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
I really don't know

237
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Risen above

238
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Miami

239
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
Disgusted by I'm a lawyer just like them

240
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Defeat them

241
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
So that I can be the top dog if you'll be above them

242
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
In this pile of skulls a sentence

243
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Long time ago

244
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Spirit entered by

245
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Body

246
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
But now I really transcended oboy

247
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
Oh boy so the good news is that Alex has transcended his enemies over at did transcend them when he was a baby

248
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
So we're on the same path is like David Lynch

249
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Now we're into Transit

250
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
What you need to do is trans

251
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Okay

252
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Ye shall

253
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
I was like this is a this is a mood

254
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
News

255
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
To delusions of grandeur

256
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
There's something they're interesting way to start

257
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,839
Show ended now

258
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
That's nice

259
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
We have to really transcend

260
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Work for you

261
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Still

262
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Resistance

263
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
And still say no to it

264
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
But not even give it energy when we do it

265
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
These are like sad mad dogs with rabies

266
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Foaming at the mouth

267
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
And you know they're already got

268
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Done for it

269
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
So you need to just

270
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
I guess that means communes

271
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Is that what he's trying to say

272
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
Let's visit the world in the globalists and all the Minions are all

273
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,295
What are mad dogs out there you just got to keep him away from biting

274
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Your children and stay away from

275
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
The Gutter Guy is their own

276
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
Sure he'll mess or whatever

277
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
So yeah,

278
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,071
I don't know did Alex get a phone call from Michelle Obama and she was like listen Ali

279
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
I know you've never tried this

280
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
This before

281
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
But

282
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
When they go low

283
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,031
We transcend

284
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
I don't I don't know it sounded like,

285
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
And I doubt there's going to be

286
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Technology their base

287
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
His earlier statement

288
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Seems like he's trying

289
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
To go back to pre-industrial world

290
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
Not only not only that

291
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
He's also going to shake up

292
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,719
And I will say that he has actually done this

293
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,839
Make a better show but he doesn't

294
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
I'm your host Alex Jones

295
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Pharmacy Hewlett

296
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
Avant-garde

297
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Transmission

298
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Transmission up

299
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Woodmore your calls more

300
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
Gas and more special reports and more

301
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Live

302
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Commercial free podcast

303
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
You have my commitment

304
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
But here in the home stretch of going into the next level

305
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
Working harder because things are

306
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
Believer

307
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
Something I never do

308
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,663
Storiesig

309
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Farting

310
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Make sure your family and others don't get it

311
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
Then I usually barely plug at the end of the hour but

312
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Couple big guns

313
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:35,743
We won't be really shaken up the show

314
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
Broadcast surrealistic

315
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,655
Except that I'm not going to do I just want to let everybody know I'm going to need

316
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
You do more ad

317
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Straight

318
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,823
The adverb of the broadcast

319
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
I honestly don't

320
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
I think he took any calls on this truck

321
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Why does that not

322
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,831
Surprise but I wouldn't drive any of the guests as being quick

323
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
But he did go to a plug

324
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,791
I got that weird mood that he was in and then right

325
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,375
This is f***** up

326
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Alex

327
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
It's two talking about

328
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
What's some news

329
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
And it's

330
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,847
Sort of what I believe is the new development and evolution of covid

331
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Conspiracies and narratives

332
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,479
They're still almost completely shut down

333
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
Tens of millions extras it's a footnote have starved to death

334
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Ian

335
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
The third world

336
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
In India

337
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
In areas of Asia the Middle East

338
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
We got those

339
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Any virus will kill them

340
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Antivirus

341
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,823
Is Alex a specific date on this he should really discuss it because you just

342
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,431
A references having this day too and I actually talking about it could be really illuminative

343
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,063
I suspect he doesn't have any actual information he's just winging it and ripping off comments that were made by David Beasley

344
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Do you want food program executor

345
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
YouTube wrecker back

346
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Can September

347
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
This is definitely a serious issue

348
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
This is definitely right

349
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
Call attention to but the way he calls attention to the problem

350
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
A food insecurity in the developing world doesn't deserve it

351
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Did the idea of actually helping on

352
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Understand

353
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Resolve the problem

354
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
And that's because Alex doesn't care about the actual problem

355
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
He cares about using the impression that he cares about it to attack people who believe

356
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
The covid-19 is an actual problem

357
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
Food insecurity around the world is a complicated picture

358
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
You can't just say that lockdowns in the US or Europe directly leads to worst

359
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Conditions in other countries

360
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
For instance this past year countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda india-pak

361
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Pakistan and Somalia

362
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
Is an incredibly severe Locust

363
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Swarm said it had nothing to do with Coronavirus

364
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Or any countries response to it

365
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,079
Affected the world situation to make things worse but there's a larger picture than just what Alex wants to cover which is essentially

366
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,151
He's all the businesses we just opened back up everyone would be fine

367
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,783
It's really troubling to see Alex try to get into the game of pretending the covid deaths are actually starvation

368
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Ocean deaths that are being covered up

369
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,159
The basic problem here is that Alex just making that up as a way for him to go

370
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Continuous denial of this major pandemic

371
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
But even beyond that the numbers

372
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Just don't work

373
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
Concern USA released a list of the end

374
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
2020 of the countries facing the greatest food in

375
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
Insecurities you compare that list to list of

376
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Countries in

377
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Aldi's

378
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
You don't come away with the

379
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
Conclusion that Alex wants you to

380
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
Chad is the country facing the most food insecurity the most severe food in

381
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
Security only been 170 deaths

382
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
From covid there

383
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Demoralize

384
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Is number two on the list where there been

385
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
3 covid

386
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
Madagascar is number three where there been

387
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
N600

388
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
13 deaths from covid

389
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
Haiti's number 4 with a red

390
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Mr. 250

391
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Before covid

392
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,959
Only numbers 9 and 10 on the list Afghanistan and Nigeria respectively have over a thousand deaths total

393
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
From covid recovery

394
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Until early March

395
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
The US was seeing more covid deaths

396
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
That's per day than any of these countries have had throughout the

397
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Fire panda

398
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
If Alex tries to redefine codesa secretly being starvation deaths

399
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,087
He's essentially trying to use people's deaths as a political prop for his own narrative

400
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,440
This behavior is nothing new to Alex but it should be recognized as

401
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Endeavor people

402
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
Understand the disrespect

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
That he's operating with towards people

404
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Humanity

405
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah you cannot

406
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
You just can't trust anybody who when you're talkin

407
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,032
Sing about engaging with a serious issue just goes

408
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
No we don't need to do that

409
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
What about that

410
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Because then what's the point

411
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
Only ever going to be talk

412
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Talking about whatever it is that you think is important

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
And no matter what I say it's going to change

414
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Change based on you not wanting to engage with

415
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
With what I'm saying how are we supposed to

416
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
So this

417
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
Is primarily being deployed right now this narrative

418
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Because there's a lot of news coming out about India

419
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
How

420
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
Take the situation

421
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
The devastation

422
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
So Alec

423
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
I wouldn't say he's doing the

424
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
India

425
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,368
Will you look at the end and thousands a week right now extra

426
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Concentration camp

427
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
The common cold is killing them

428
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
And then the media tells you that covid-19 data

429
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
When India is starving to death now

430
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Well there's a

431
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
What

432
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
Always had outdoor cremations they've always had mask

433
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
For the poor

434
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
Friends and family bonding in the other documentaries about it

435
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Outside

436
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
What are you talkin about

437
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
What are we even doing

438
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:00,608
Just saying there about Indian deaths from malnutrition being called

439
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
His own feelings and asses about things

440
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
The situation in India with covid Israeli,

441
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
Okay. But there are number of driving factors the people

442
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
4.2 in terms of what's making the

443
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Mr. Right now

444
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Incredibly horrific

445
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
The first appears to be level of unprepared

446
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Healthcare journalist

447
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Vicis down the car Road apiece recently and sad news that

448
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Explain this element of the situation

449
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
India's early success in nearly flattening the covid-19

450
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
18 curved in 2020 may be the cause of

451
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
The current Calamba

452
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,608
The spider rickety and funding starve Healthcare infrastructure

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,984
The country's ability to manage the first wave of covid-19 look Lauda balazs the United States Canada

454
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
And countries in Europe real.

455
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Under second and third waves

456
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
The pandemic

457
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Then things went awry

458
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
The turnaround raise false hopes

459
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
The virus had run out of steam in India and the country would be

460
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Be spared a second

461
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,832
That lets people unprepared to deal with a heavy blow that was coming

462
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
Modi declared Victory and held massive political rallies

463
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,768
At the same time Hindu pilgrims amassed at the Ganges River where quote

464
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,584
As many as 2.5 million people took part

465
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
With scant attention to

466
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Do covid-19 safety protocols

467
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,520
By the time an avalanche of criticism cut short the festival the virus has infected thousands of pilgrims

468
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
Who took it home to their neighborhoods in Philly

469
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,920
These types of massive Gatherings of people allowed for a broader spread

470
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,456
Nothing would have happened otherwise

471
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Discovery of the new strain of High Park

472
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
Contagious virus in India while back in

473
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
In-house D Healthcare

474
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
Infrastructure is pushed to its situation

475
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Like we're seeing now which is

476
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Terrible

477
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
There's a humanitarian disaster

478
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Are going on right now and

479
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
Dendi people of India need all the help that the international

480
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Community camp

481
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Provide

482
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
But trying to pretend that the dancer Dulce Georgia

483
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
Just malnutrition deaths

484
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
They're being secretly lifted

485
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
It's covid-19

486
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,640
Booking disrespectful to the people of India and what they're going through

487
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
There should be no greater thing

488
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
That is no greater red

489
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
Red flag than any

490
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Right-wing reactionary politician

491
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
Declaring victory over any worldwide problem immediate sign for everybody in that country.

492
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
Snowdog

493
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
We're going to die

494
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
That's the first thing I scream whenever I hear a politician

495
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Play mission

496
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
She at

497
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Sissy with Alex

498
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Is a coup

499
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
Completes need

500
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
To Justified

501
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Who is audien

502
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Right because it

503
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Can't be possibly covid

504
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
No edits India's Trump

505
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Too so we can't be right

506
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,672
Yeah what I fail to understand that I would love

507
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Explain this is

508
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:38,304
What's the Indian government's motive for supposedly calling these malnutrition deaths covid

509
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
I understand that Alex thinks

510
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
The US hospitals were in a

511
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Get rich quick

512
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,984
Steamer they called other desk covid cuz Medicare pays them a certain amount

513
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Covid treatment

514
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Does he think that's

515
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,104
The casein every country that does he think the doctors in Indy RC

516
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,248
Scamming Medicare globalist to have a profit-sharing program for this kind of scam must have

517
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah it's whatever

518
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Really really bizarre and

519
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
When you start

520
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Look at

521
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,208
What's actually being said it just doesn't make any sense and it's route

522
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
It's dark

523
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Well I mean I suppose in his conception

524
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Any and all

525
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
Profiting or or carpetbagging

526
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Goes into one big

527
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,520
Pop for all the evil Global scams around the world so it's like

528
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
You know it all scams are fungible

529
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Jess

530
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
That's dumb

531
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Real dub

532
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,248
So anyway look there's people starving

533
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
I guess

534
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
According to

535
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
Alex all these people that have malnutrition

536
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Shoreline

537
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
Sure and also in Venezuela

538
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Peopleadmin

539
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Nutrition

00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
What's 1000

542
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
5 pictures of extra

543
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,544
It was 2,000 last number that came out resume

544
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312

545
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Thousand

546
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
People

547
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
A week

548
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,064
Call it starvation

549
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,624
Your statistician or doctor you'll be arrested

550
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Malnutrition

551
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
They work

552
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
I would like to challenge Alex to produce any of that

553
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Information details up

554
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
In India are being called

555
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Shoreline

556
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Also food

557
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,504
Security is a very real issue in Venezuela and again the particular contributing factors are

558
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
However it's important

559
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,856
Recognize how even if all of Alex's imaginary

560
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Conspiracy was actually happening

561
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
The numbers don't make

562
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Sense

563
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,768
Venezuela has recorded a total of just over 2,000

564
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
I'm covid-19 related that

565
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Shouldn't the number be much higher if Alex

566
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Does Duncan spiracy were real

567
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Roughly

568
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
250,000

569
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
It's important to recognize what's going on

570
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,664
Alex is trying to argue the death listed as covid in India or actually just malnutrition deaths that are being mislabeled

571
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,296
In order to defend this baseless claim Alex points to Venezuela where they're apparently tons about attrition death

572
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,952
In order for Alex's argument to make any sense it would need to be the case of these malnutrition deaths in Venezuela being reclassified as covid-19

573
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Because if that were the case

574
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
The bring of Venezuela means absolutely nothing in this

575
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Alex's brain works from memes

576
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Not information

577
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
When there's a story about malnutrition in the right-wing media the meme the audio

578
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Been trained to respond to his

579
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Bring up Venezuela

580
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
How much is no point did he's even make

581
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,176
Everybody knows that if he just says it's like Venezuela the listeners will just

582
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,320
Not in agreement with said

583
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Unless you think

584
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Cares I would be

585
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:51,072
Be hard-pressed to get to a point where I do but well this this will be this will vaccinate you for a vet

586
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
Impression taking Bowl

587
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Oh look

588
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,472
The Indians are starving to death

589
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Find

590
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,688
People outside

591
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,160
Why online

592
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,304
Bobby Brown

593
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Wow

594
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
You know I don't hear just a such a simple

595
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
F****** go f*** yourself on

596
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:37,408
Okay if you're going to what about me with the Indians are starving and we even know age group

597
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,224
AA groups are saying the Indians are starving

598
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Alright

599
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
So you're going to tell me that that's it

600
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Issue you f******

601
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Care about that the Republic

602
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Party cares about

603
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
If the Republican party is in power they should at the very least

604
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
Mentioned that they care about Empower but when they are in power

605
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,448
Forget all this building a couple of quick clarification

606
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,544
One very important to recognize that right now

607
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,872
Alex's brand is moving away from the Republican Party

608
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
Because it does not look like a trump nominee is going to be the

609
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
The 2024 candidate that people are going to coalesce by

610
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
So I believe there's that fracture

611
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Fracturing

612
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Happening

613
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
And Alex is soon to be above the left-right paradigm

614
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
We'll get back to that

615
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,144
Who won wriggles out of this b******* whenever you want to say like complaints about the Republican party yes

616
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,752
Absolutely valid criticism although Alex will be deflecting that in the future

617
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Trumpet

618
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Party Patriot party whatever the

619
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
Until they have an official name it's going to be difficult to make these darts hit the right spot

620
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Further notice

621
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
That's fair enough

622
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,648
So yeah I also like the idea that Alex is talking about real world

623
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
Presumably real world

624
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Let me get back to what I was talking about

625
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,496
You know what else we got

626
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
We have some pills

627
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
So this this next Clippers is fun

628
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
This was a something that I decided to

629
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Have a little bit of

630
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Addicted to the bottom of

631
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
The whole lot

632
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
Sure I remember it's out reading a headline

633
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,672
Permanent

634
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
Infowars.com

635
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
And it links to BBC CNN

636
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
I could have told you that

637
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
Bill Gates the last year

638
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
He said it's never going to end

639
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Applebee's

640
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
This is a Paul Joseph Watson

641
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Sun article on Infowars

642
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,736
And I found this to be a great opportunity to illustrate how Infowars misleads that doesn't actually cover the news

643
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
That they're even

644
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Pretending to

645
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,672
The second half of this article to Paul Road is just the standard antemasque stuff you find it pretty much any article on their website today

646
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Do with masks

647
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
So I'm just going to ignore

648
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
All that

649
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
The actual headline is quote

650
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Health experts

651
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,912
Encourage CDC to implement permanent mask mandate

652
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
This article does not lie

653
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
BBC or Sienna

654
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
In fact the entire story is based on what article from

655
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
The Providence Journal

656
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,944
This is an outlet from Rhode Island published in December 2020

657
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
With the headline quote

658
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
I think about life without a mask

659
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:28,416
Think against a Rhode Island experts North Korea hit those boat balance

660
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,488
Leaving aside the fact that this is almost

661
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,072
5 months old as an article in Infowars pretending it's news

662
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,680
If you look deeper into how the original article is misrepresented you get an even better sense

663
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
The propaganda that's being

664
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Deployed here

665
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
The two experts at work

666
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Consultant for this Providence

667
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
Journal article Nicole Alexander Scott

668
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
And dr. Leonard a mermaid

669
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,528
Neither of them at any point seemed to be encouraging the CDC to make mask wearing permanent or May

670
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Dory

671
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
As the headline might lead you to think

672
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
You would think that's where they would be going right

673
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,232
Here's the part of the Infowars article the quote to dr. Alexander Scott

674
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
Quote we've seen benefits of masks

675
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,888
Americare Health director Nicole Alexander Scott told the property

676
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
It's Journal

677
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
So there may be a new form of normalcy wear masks

678
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Don't necessarily have to go away

679
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,592
This is all good and well as that passage does appear in the actual Ark

680
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,152
However consider that Infowars Lee

681
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
Their first line of the story is quote

682
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
Health experts are insisting that the CDC

683
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,880
Should Implement permanent mask mandates even after the covid-19 pandemic end

684
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
That doesn't seem like

685
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
Alexander Scott is insisting that the CDC Implement anything

686
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Commenting with her maybe utility ink

687
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Continued mask-wearing

688
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
Obviously to cut down on transmission of

689
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Annual flu

690
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,312
This Sensational rising of almost half a year old comments made by a Rhode Island doctor that Alex apologize Watson

691
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Never heard of before

692
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
That's bad enough

693
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
But if you go read the actual articles there's another quote from Alexander Scott that Paul is intentionally leaving out of the article

694
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
Cuz it doesn't serve the purposes of the propaganda

695
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648
She was like woah woah woah before you take me out of

696
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,976
Text I know Paul Joseph Watson is reading this

697
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
I can't hang

698
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Providence Journal article

699
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Quote

700
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,120
Alexandra Scott said State Health officials have much.

701
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,936
Consider before taking the final position on whether mask-wearing should

702
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
To continue after

703
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Pandemic

704
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,032
I want to reserve the ability to research

705
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,384
And see what are some of the things that we've introduced because of the pandemic that are valuable to continue

706
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,176
She said she hopes

707
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
The public would see

708
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
See the benefits of mask-wearing if it's

709
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Continuances recommended

710
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Quote my help would be

711
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
My hope would be the folks would

712
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
See the value of

713
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Continuing that you said

714
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
It's unlikely to be a definitive mandate

715
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,232
But we want to be driven by the data and the Sia

716
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
That's like

717
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168
What if you're heartless soulless monsters corporate boss forces you to go to work regardless of whether

718
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
Or not you were feeling ill perhaps

719
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Instead of the old way

720
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264
Waze before the pan

721
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
Pandemic where you would just show up to work

722
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Sneeze all over everything

723
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
You should try wearing a mask

724
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
Or if there's no reason for you to need to go into work

725
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,088
You can work remotely why not feeling well and you can be just as

726
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
Productive at home

727
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:13,280
Call any of these things are possible implications or ideas of what she

728
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,424
Could be talkin about seems like every work and it's important to recognize that she's very clearly talking about being driven by data and

729
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
In science

730
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
So that's clear

731
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Do you know that

732
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
She saying that they

733
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
It could be advantageous

734
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
There's not likely to be a definitive mandate

735
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
That position

736
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
Clearly articulated in the original article is

737
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
Completely misrepresented by the Infowars article because they are liars

738
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
We're doing this for prom

739
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,136
The second expert in the article is Doctor marble

740
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Here's what Paul includes

741
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,232
His comments in the Infowars article

742
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
And it begins with the including a mistaken reference

743
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
It's to dr. Alexander Scott as his

744
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Stop

745
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,264
His sentiments were echoed by dr. Leonard a verbal medical director of epidemiology and infection

746
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
Control it Rhode Island

747
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
Who said making people wear masks all the time was worth it.

748
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,200
Stop the spread of viruses other than covid-19

749
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,576
Quote within the lifespan system we're seeing far fewer of the respiratory viruses than we are used

750
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
To seeing at this moment in the calendar year

751
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,696
So it's impressive the covid prevention strategies are having

752
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
An impact on other rest

753
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Pretoria viruses

754
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
Which just makes sense they spread in a similar

755
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,656
It would not surprise me if that became a recommendation

756
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
From the CDC Eastside

757
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
It's a pretty low price

758
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,800
To pay to try to reduce the risk to oneself and particularly loved ones

759
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Maybe it had a particular risk for these sorts of

760
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Infections caused

761
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Nothing harm he added

762
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,736
It would not surprise him if the CDC made a recommendation

763
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
Continue wearing masks

764
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Does that justify the weed

765
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Quote health

766
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,976
Experts are insisting that the CDC should Implement permanent mask mandates even after the covid-19 pandemic end

767
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:51,840
Does that justify that you didn't hear the tone of voice with which he said it

768
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
He said hey

769
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
Wouldn't surprise me if the

770
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,544
CDC Macy's mandatory forever because I was insisting in behind closed doors

771
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,616
My question about whether or not that's Justified is not

772
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Rhetorical

773
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
It's not this is bulshit

774
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:13,088
Make it even worse as well because he also said some stuff at Paula's just conveniently ignore

775
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
From the Providence Journal article

776
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,536
Clue was dampened significantly in the southern hemisphere in those countries that had aggressive public

777
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Lookout measures

778
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
To reduce covid risk such as asking

779
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Myrtle said

780
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
The southern hemisphere Act

781
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Timer

782
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
It's winter

783
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
And Lucy's I'm coming six months ahead of the winter in the northern have a

784
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,920
Preliminary data shows the United States having a quiet flu season with recorded cases lower

785
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
Then each of the last

786
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
Sears at the same point in the season Marvel set

787
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Quote at the moment

788
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
We're seeing mirrors

789
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
Let's hope that continues to be the case no guarantee he said

790
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,560
Right now we are for this time of year see very low prevalence

791
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
But again

792
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
It's very early so it's hard to know what to make

793
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:05,568
Wow is covering dishonestly both of the experts cited gave very general comments

794
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,384
Defective possible that wearing masks could be helpful

795
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
Hitler in cases of the flu

796
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,760
But it was too early to say that we should let data lead us to our eventual

797
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Conclusion

798
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
Neither of them were saying that the CDC needs

799
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
To make mask wearing permanent

800
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
No one was demand

801
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Any kind of mandatory mask laws

802
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
This is pretty much always the case with Infowars articles

803
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
There may be an actual news Outlet story that they're basing their coverage on but

804
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Diversion they're covering is a

805
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Funhouse mirror

806
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Of the real thing

807
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,776
Distorted so it'll fit the bulshit narratives they want to push

808
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
I chose to cover this one a little more specifically because

809
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Is pretty glaring

810
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
It's super embarrassing

811
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Nepal didn't check

812
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,504
The date on the Providence Journal article before cranking out his outrage blog post

813
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
He's honestly hilarious

814
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
And here's another a paragraph from Paul's article just cuz

815
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
I'd like to poke

816
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
Keep in mind experts that he's a rapper

817
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Printing

818
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,304
Two Doctors in Rhode Island who spoke to a local paper

819
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
5 months ago

820
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Ears business from Paul's article

821
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,984
Came out this week so let me get that let me set the street and let me set the scene alright

822
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,872
So we've got these two doctors they're on the phone with a Providence of local Providence Rhode Island Journal

823
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
They're they're busy there at the house

824
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Hospital they're dealing with s***

825
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,296
They're talking to this person alright block of times.

826
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Then

827
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Cut 2

828
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
5 months later

829
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Alright here we are

830
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
Medical professionals are still attempting to have mask mandates become part of the new normal despite dr. Anthony fauci

831
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Acknowledging yesterday

832
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
Little B common sense

833
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
For the CDC to start relaxing measured

834
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Wait till now fauci is

835
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
What do you understand what's going on here there's a war going on

836
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Understand

837
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Sloppy s*** man you know how sometimes I'm like damn we can't let scientist named stuff cuz they accidentally made

838
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,792
Really intimidating things or we can't let scientist

839
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,400
Two journalists the same way they would two other scientists because other people will twist it because they

840
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
I can't really quite

841
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
You know and it's not there

842
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
They don't have that too

843
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Kind of socialized

844
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
That kind of thing

845
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
In this circle

846
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
There's nothing you can do

847
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
There's nothing you can do well I know I agree

848
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,248
Because the doctors did not convey information

849
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Really they just

850
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Still we're taking

851
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,160
You can't do the stuff that fall does

852
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,560
It's like no one can never talk again

853
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,888
Felt like she named it murdertown

854
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Fictitious plates

855
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
Temptation of something that did happen in as much as

856
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
Two Doctors in Rhode Island talk to a local paper 5-month

857
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
No it's free

858
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
This is this is 50

859
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Give people hearts

860
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Naturally

861
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Fifty Shades of Grey

862
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,576
So Alex on the new on the show here in April

863
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
All right get some other song

864
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
I'm sorry

865
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,792
Stanford study results

866
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Facts

867
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
New study suggests

868
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Where in Imagine effect

869
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
New study highlights face math problem

870
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Was safely in

871
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,296
If you're paying attention you'll notice that these headlines

872
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
These three add lines are all just different dumb blogs riding around headline about the same underlying story supposed Stanford

873
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Study that says that mask

874
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
So bad

875
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
If you're not paying attention

876
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
As I was already in

877
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Almost never is

878
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
There's a flood

879
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
Study showing that Master dangerous

880
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
You were right all along to be against

881
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,544
Three studies at least he's just name them just just

882
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,895
That's the impression I was just trying to create by repeatedly hitting

883
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
As if it's three

884
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Fun stories

885
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
Also this paper that mask was written by a guy named Bruce

886
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Ventra balance

887
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,391
Visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper

888
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
Between 2015 and twenty

889
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
16 at Stanford

890
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,791
Other than that he has no connection with Stanford and Stanford his work

891
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
Direction to take her name off this b*******

892
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
This is an important point to bring up

893
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,215
People like Alex in the right-wing media hate authoritative

894
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,847
The mainstream media the enemy of the people in the universities are just full of liars trying to push

895
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
The globalist agenda

896
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
And yet

897
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:30,271
Whenever they have the opportunity to pretend that one of their narratives is backed by the authority of the gums

898
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,623
Top scientist top scientists all over this way I want ever they can

899
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,671
Back there

900
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
Appealing to the authority of our real mainstream or academic in

901
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,887
Associate their ideas with a respectable source

902
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,727
Bulshit we normally talk about anyone who thinks that people like Alex or legit

903
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
Should really question why they do that

904
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
Yeah yeah yeah

905
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
This paper was published in a journal called medical hypotheses

906
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,943
Which is basically exactly what it sounds like

907
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,991
And outlet for French nonsense and

908
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
Unsubstantiated ideas

909
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,391
Neighbors trash the conclusion runs at odds with dozens of other more rigorously design

910
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,719
Studies is being falsely attributed to Stanford Notre to elevated

911
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Credibility

912
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
It's basically the norm

913
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Comes to information sources that Infowars use

914
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
Nothing

915
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
It's because

916
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,495
The underlying unspoken thing they're saying there is look

917
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
Even people who do work

918
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,919
Believe this and even people who work on this ship believe

919
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Princeton Washington Post

920
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
You know it's true because they actually have to work on it

921
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
Bulshit

922
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
So you're saying whatever you don't

923
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
You're a mediately implying

924
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
That you're lying all of the time

925
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Except

926
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Pull out 3 months ago

927
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,567
You cannot produce didn't want to get pregnant

928
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,663
Come on now causes autoimmune responses

929
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
Allergic reactions

930
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Labs

931
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Said

932
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,463
We suggest you don't take vaccines and you just get hurt immunity

933
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Oh really

934
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Make a vaccine

935
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
Babe brought enough for the protein virus

936
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
This isn't true

937
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,263
I was just making up his entire story about Weimar

938
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,567
Decided to spend their efforts to develop covid

939
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,943
In reality she actually read their statements it was a situation where they had to Camp vaccines

940
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,759
Switch the test subjects responded well to but quote

941
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,111
The immune responses were inferior to those seen following not natural infection

942
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
And those reported for other SARS CO2

943
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
Covid-19 vaccine

944
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
Start from scratch on new vaccine candidates were there already other promising vaccines coming to Market it would have been a waste of resources

945
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,959
For them so what they decided to do with a just a research strategy

946
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Focus on therapeutic

947
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
But they might be able to

948
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Develop

949
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,383
All of Alex's story about them saying you shouldn't take backsies in a vaccine for covid 2 possible

950
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,455
That's just completely made up from his imagination and it's fun

951
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
I'm sure the audience enjoys it but it's not real

952
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
Halo

953
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
Does bulshit anybody trust him when he says

954
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Anything about virus

955
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,231
Like honestly just tell me what a virus

956
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Steven looks like

957
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
Before you're telling me what viruses do

958
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
Diablo

959
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,823
The red horn

960
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Fabfitfun

961
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,407
That's also true

962
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
You nailed it

963
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
So

964
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,319
Alex narrative

965
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,903
Is trying to rationalize the covid deaths in India

966
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
Andre contextualize them

967
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
I'm as what he's

968
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
He's calling malnutrition

969
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,119
Don't worry about this week

970
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Midis

971
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
Ajm covid-19 Supply

972
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Salmon continues also in India

973
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
The reality of covid in India right now

974
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
Scary and it should be something that creates feelings of

975
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,735
Concern and care for people for the people in India

976
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,807
It also creates a real sense of the steaks the people are facing when it come

977
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
To the virus

978
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
These realizations are dangerous rally

979
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,951
Alex because his entire last year of workers but dedicated to minimize

980
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
The covid pandemic for-profit

981
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
And help is God King Trump not look bad

982
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,423
The informers audience cannot be allowed to think that the human tragedy in India is real because that threatened

983
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
The bottom line of Alex's operation

984
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
You see what you see here

985
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Complete rewriting of the

986
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Situation

987
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
You can keep the feelings of concern and care for

988
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
For the people of India

989
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
You're being lied to about why you

990
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
It's not about the virus

991
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
It's about malnutrition

992
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
You can keep that human empathy

993
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
But Alex has to protect

994
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
The business

995
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
You can see a sleight-of-hand really clearly here

996
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,047
In order to make his argument that all the covid deaths in India are secretly just malnutrition

997
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
He's referencing a May 8th

998
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,887
2020 article published by the Atlantic

999
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,215
Cancel warning of the possibility of salmon due to supply chain breakdown

1000
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,103
The actual headline is quotes world food program David Beasley warns of dire famines in Africa Middle East

1001
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Hey covid-19 supply chain

1002
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
Damage continue

1003
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,759
But you see how Alex amended the headline to add India in there because

1004
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
He needs to make it look like that for the narrative

1005
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,439
The word India doesn't appear in that article at all and even this article isn't just about covid

1006
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
It's also about other influences on

1007
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
Food insecurity like the flooding those happening in Sudan

1008
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
And the massive locust swarm

1009
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
It's a complicated humanitarian issue that demands attention

1010
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
But Alex's attempt

1011
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
To hijack that attention

1012
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
And use it as a prop for his covid-19 with narrative

1013
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Which is Google

1014
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
Ghoulish I say

1015
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Yeah the

1016
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,455
The fundamental thing that the right-wing has to do first

1017
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
The Earth

1018
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
Your family members could people you know you're like

1019
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
How is it that these people who are

1020
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
Person in in conversation so empathetic

1021
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
And caring and

1022
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
And kind

1023
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
How is it that large National issues

1024
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Monsters

1025
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,703
And it's like the right-wing has to redirect that empathy otherwise

1026
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
People will never buy

1027
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
People are never going to be like

1028
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:17,407
Hey yeah I think we should steal money from the poor and kill them you know you have to redirect

1029
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Yeah absolutely

1030
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,783
And it's what you see being done here

1031
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,087
Yeah and it just destroys people's brain

1032
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Really

1033
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
Destroyer

1034
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:32,767
Crippling of your ability to care for other people

1035
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,095
In a meaningful way

1036
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
And it's held up in

1037
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Supported by

1038
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Constant

1039
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
Miss goose

1040
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,775
Information

1041
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
But another art

1042
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,639
Coronavirus India's lockdown turning into humanitarian crisis

1043
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
German news dwu

1044
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
6/8 months ago admitting

1045
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
How did lying about that article

1046
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
The headline is real and is a real article

1047
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:03,487
Frompw but it's about a desperate situation that many migrant workers and

1048
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
India were experiencing due to covid lockdown

1049
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,703
Maybe you found themselves without work due to business closures and they were far away from their homes and Villages outside major cities

1050
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
Dad to that difficulty drains have been closed

1051
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,591
And although there was eventually a plan put in place to help Transit

1052
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
Going to stranded workers back

1053
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
Back to where it was not smoothly implemented

1054
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
This article doesn't admit that millions of starve to death

1055
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,623
It's a report that's meant to bring attention to an issue that some might not be aware of

1056
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
Analysis lying about

1057
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
Defenders indefensible narratives all the covid deaths

1058
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
India Arie

1059
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
That's what he's doing

1060
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Wow

1061
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
You know

1062
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Guess what

1063
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,703
It's just as horrific whenever he's doing it about a

1064
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,359
Truth never changes true I don't feel different about it because he's lying about Indian said the United

1065
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
F*** him

1066
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
So

1067
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,735
This clip is we're jumping to another topic

1068
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
I don't have set this club up

1069
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
This is weird man

1070
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,695
And I wish you any harm myself I'm not called revolt against you

1071
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
It's already

1072
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
Publicly

1073
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
I think Prince Charles self

1074
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Publicly

1075
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
Ourself

1076
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Maybe he's right

1077
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
Start the operation

1078
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Which is the final mop-up

1079
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Operation

1080
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,143
Is that plans see the drawings of the nerve

1081
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,751
I was not a biological with

1082
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:57,151
Along with him I was like this is a bit

1083
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,943
McCobb But ultimately

1084
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
With that

1085
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,087
But then we got into that then he was like and if they killed themselves

1086
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,415
I would agree that so everyone else should die

1087
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
Kind of weird that's what he said right

1088
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
Terms

1089
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,167
Of the secondary

1090
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
My

1091
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
Political position

1092
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
My beliefs

1093
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Are not influence

1094
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103
Spy public spectacles

1095
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
By political enemies

1096
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
Kill themselves

1097
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
I will join

1098
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,623
Is his voice I respect how I read it I got it

1099
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,463
My beliefs are so fungible

1100
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
That's all it takes

1101
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,559
Trump liquor gets up there and slaps himself in the face

1102
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,959
Still juicy what I do for this country

1103
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
Now that he's not president

1104
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
He has finally become the president

1105
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
The United States

1106
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,639
What the hell is this I mean I I obviously don't believe him

1107
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
But he's still saying it

1108
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
Tweakers say out loud

1109
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
So we have high-minded issue

1110
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
The cover on the table 20

1111
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,671
6 show

1112
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
Disagree with you but keep going

1113
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
Because that was me because

1114
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
I'm pretty disconnected

1115
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:25,215
Pop culture as a whole even realize the Oscars happen

1116
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,287
Write priority

1117
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,359
I heard about the Anthony Hopkins

1118
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Insertive kerfuffle

1119
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:38,271
I have no interest in the Oscars didn't before and I really hate Oscars drama

1120
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
I don't know if it's not it's not something

1121
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,135
Necessarily a huge part of

1122
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
The stuff that takes up space in my mind totally

1123
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:50,047
Alex hates the media he hates movies he hates Hollywood

1124
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
He thinks about it

1125
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:58,239
The most important thing in the world

1126
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
This is

1127
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Regina King

1128
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
From actress

1129
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,711
Call pissed-off up

1130
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,575
She's a good person she's up against those bad white people

1131
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,487
Thunderbolt Sodom March against

1132
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Wear fancy

1133
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
$5,000 dresses

1134
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
Private jet

1135
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
About evil America

1136
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
Produce so much wealthy live like that

1137
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
Africans are starving to death

1138
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
By the tens of thousands every day

1139
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
You can see how Alex is criticism of Regina King is 100-percent racially-based

1140
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,671
Know anything about her as a person or what sorts of

1141
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
The charity works you may be involved in

1142
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Always uses a black woman

1143
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,583
And saying something that he doesn't like and his response is racist outrage

1144
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,887
So in her intro speech

1145
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,447
The king mentioned how difficult the last year has been

1146
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,775
And how is the show converted the different she might have traded in her heels

1147
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
For marching boots

1148
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,175
This statement is experienced by Alex as her saying she would have been marching against the evil white people because

1149
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
Everything in his life is filtered through the lenses

1150
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
White victimhood

1151
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
Yeah it does seem like the people

1152
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,599
Yeah that's not good

1153
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
Also don't come after

1154
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Regina King

1155
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
Somebody want to come

1156
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
She's amazing

1157
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,583
I don't think Alex knows anything about her he knows nothing about her

1158
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Doesn't even know

1159
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,215
Who this next person is declaring an idiot

1160
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
Telling people that there's an

1161
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,895
Disproportionately police shoot black man

1162
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
When it's actually the other way around

1163
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,295
On average the police in America everyday kill three people

1164
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,879
About a thousand people a year

1165
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,231
Those people happen Edition fortunately

1166
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,839
James Baldwin

1167
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:04,191
The most despicable thing a person can be as indifferent to other people's pain

1168
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
I just ask that you please

1169
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Not feeling different

1170
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Please

1171
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Don't be a dick

1172
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Literally up there wearing

1173
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
Clowns

1174
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,271
I guess I wasn't being indifferent to people's

1175
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
Spain as much as he was being hostile towards it and buying its validity

1176
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
People's Bank

1177
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Alex is wrong about those

1178
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,303
Statistics because the very important word he doesn't understand

1179
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,839
Proportion exactly

1180
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
You refuses to

1181
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Statistic

1182
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
Incontact

1183
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
It's because if you do that his arguments fall apart in

1184
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Also that was travel on free

1185
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
The writer-director who won an Oscar for best live Act

1186
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Action short for two discs

1187
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Austin strangers

1188
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
He's just another idiot

1189
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,015
Because he's a black man attempting to appeal to the better side of people's Humanity

1190
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Almost comically racist Behavior Analysis Bart

1191
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
It's not surprising at all

1192
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
I mean it's just install gnashing

1193
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
How

1194
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Portent

1195
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
Skin color is to him

1196
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
While at the same time

1197
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
He is that

1198
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
He's not racist

1199
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,447
Like if you bring up the color of someone's

1200
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Skin

1201
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
That much

1202
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Yeah

1203
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,383
Just spend a little while

1204
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Complaining about the Oscars butt

1205
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,271
Well sure there were black people represented at the Oscars and we can

1206
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,695
Back in my day we used to win an Oscar for films like Birth of a Nation

1207
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,023
Because they changed film set of our forever and that's

1208
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,839
That's why the only reason I look better

1209
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Sure

1210
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,423
He gets on to another topic

1211
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
Or does he

1212
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
Here's video ladies and gentlemen

1213
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Tennessee

1214
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
Police officer

1215
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,575
This is just crazy though to watch this on phone

1216
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
We have some very exciting news

1217
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,327
Best selling products is turmeric we have

1218
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095

You forgot the store you

1220
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
Not sure what I'm supposed to talk about

1221
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,495
Just in case you were wondering turmeric

1222
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,079
Okay bye I forgot the story so I'ma Do a plug

1223
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,407

1224
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
360 friend

1225
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Lewd

1226
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,551
Declared it over for Humanity a year ago

1227
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Lone Survivor

1228
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
That is been born

1229
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
And now he has a new story

1230
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,183
32 towel

1231
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
And it also is understory out

1232
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,351
Dominos.com

1233
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,399
Health Ranger post

1234
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Microscopes

1235
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
Covid-19

1236
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,591
Mysterious

1237
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,383
Others have scanned them

1238
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
And found similar

1239
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,967
Weird things

1240
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,087
There's also German

1241
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Researchers have tested

1242
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
What's in the Pfizer shot

1243
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
Hamilton

1244
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
Intestinal cells

1245
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,911
Clearly this is getting weirder

1246
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
And weirder

1247
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
A stranger

1248
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,847
So I don't know what this it has to do with vaccine this is just mic test

1249
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
Some pictures of masks

1250
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Send swabs

1251
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,991
Stop the moving

1252
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,319
Stuff in the swabs and

1253
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
That's not from studies

1254
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
That was from a Tik-Tok

1255
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
A video that came out in January

1256
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
It's been pretty debunked by scientists with the underlined claim that video is the people were being intentionally given Morgellons disease

1257
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Covid swab

1258
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:51,263
The conspiracy was so dumb and evidence was so laughable this one didn't really stick what it did get a lot of attention

1259
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,591
The kind of makes sense for someone like Alex or Micah try any of

1260
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,383
A little bit

1261
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,711
That's if you can whitewash it a tiny bit put a respectable son

1262
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,015
See if you can make some money off this fake

1263
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,855
Tik-tok-video delusions

1264
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
The grandeur

1265
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Allah Allah

1266
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
However it does

1267
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
Seem like these guys wake up every morning and they're like

1268
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
What could I do today that makes

1269
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,423
Jordan fantasize about owning a flamethrower

1270
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,983
Jordan and Elon Musk closer

1271
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,847
Let's see what it really is going to take for Jordan to buy a flamethrower

1272
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,455
Natural news articles this is about a little self-conscious about

1273
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:36,319
In a caption for the microscope image supposedly of a fiber and some Masky was looking at

1274
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
He adds quote

1275
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,695
We do not know why these fibers are there and we are not claiming them to be more challenge

1276
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
Viber okay

1277
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,559
Alright I applaud that attempt to be taken seriously although I

1278
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,167
I think it's difficult when that other captions for an image of a mask says

1279
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
Quote some areas of the carbon

1280
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,799
Fiber strands appear to surround exact looking objects

1281
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,871
But they might Simply Be bumped Textures in the white

1282
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,151
Fiber layer

1283
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,479
Oh my God that's that's like saying

1284
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,879
That we don't know what the screenshot is from we think it is absolutely an alien spacecraft

1285
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,695
It could be from a video game that's also possible

1286
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:22,143
The Weeknd Mike released a series of completely meaningless microscope images of things that he speculating RC

1287
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,471
One of them was that picture of fibrous Transit amass

1288
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,055
Ask which I may be exact or maybe bumps in texture for

1289
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
By Monday

1290
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
He published a blog post on his website about these images

1291
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
An exact same image has this text along with it

1292
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
What is this

1293
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Exactly

1294
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,111
Structure in this first photo look carbon-fibre Mass

1295
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,207
Gone is a very sensible suggestion that it might just be bumped

1296
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,743
Textures

1297
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,791
To push this exact ideas being the

1298
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
Primary in the listeners and readers Minds

1299
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,239
I'd Solvay this is the same s*** though like I don't understand how it is that you can have any page

1300
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:03,359
Be a f****** moron and everybody's like nah look at that idiot

1301
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,687
Space but then you let Mike Adams talk about microbes

1302
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:12,063
Difference of big versus small

1303
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
You're not wrong

1304
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,719
This is essentially what I would call self-driven narrative escalation

1305
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
Mike is engaging in

1306
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,375
In the first instance you implant the idea that something might be really suspicious though there might be totally normal looks

1307
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
Donation for it

1308
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,775
When you touch back on the idea the normal explanation is gone and the speculation entirely revolves around the

1309
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,103
Suspicious possibility where the burden of the conversation

1310
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Becomes this

1311
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
Proving that this is an egg sac

1312
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
Instead of the responsibility

1313
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
A being on Mike

1314
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,759
To prove that it's not a bump

1315
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,575
That's basically the propaganda smash

1316
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Guitar playing

1317
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Where the burden

1318
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,951
Proof is ignored and maybe your problem instead of theirs

1319
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:54,303
Without using this rhetorical tricking ones like it people like Alex in Mike's game

1320
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,607
Collapse immediately

1321
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,423
Anything that they say to any kind of reasonable standard

1322
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
The pope was arrested

1323
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Year ago the fake Pope prove me wrong

1324
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,407
Do you recall that it was over for Humanity in there would only be lone survivors

1325
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
Feel like

1326
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
We are some of the few people who recall that many people just ignore you might also recall that Mike Adams was

1327
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,647
From Infowars for months because he and Alex

1328
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,463
Disagreed on whether or not covid was real

1329
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,279
It did seem that there was a disagreement there

1330
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,327
Advocating

1331
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
Take Veterinary products

1332
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
Is Mike knuble

1333
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
I want to I want to say something really a

1334
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
If they had done nothing

1335
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,111
Because natural innate immunity would have already caught

1336
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Record this

1337
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,023
6

1338
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,607
Alex

1339
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:07,007
That would make Jordan want to buy a flamethrower

1340
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,479
Guess what here's what it is everything I've ever said is a lie I believe the opposite now is over for Humanity

1341
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,295
Going to be Lone Survivor but now nothing

1342
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,575
Then everything will be fine

1343
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,463
Cool that that really is something that's just rated

1344
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,815
Should get you like that should be more against the law than yelling fire in a movie theater

1345
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Like you can't do that you just can't

1346
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,263
I just think everybody should boom I got them that's why

1347
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
The reason that rich people avoid poor people

1348
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
Too much Brewing

1349
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
I think that my

1350
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
His progression

1351
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:51,807
From the initial article where he posted these pictures to the Monday

1352
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,831
A blog post

1353
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
That overhyped

1354
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
Escalated thing

1355
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:00,511
I thought that was pretty responsible now if you listen to this his appearance on Alex's show is

1356
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Is going to be taking

1357
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,303
Swings even a step

1358
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Further

1359
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,399
It's mind-blowing Alex there are little hooks

1360
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
There are little gripper

1361
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,239
Fibers red and blue fibers

1362
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,079
In the nasal swab

1363
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
I did Altra Violet photography I did iodine standing on some of them to show the contrast

1364
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
It is mind-blowing

1365
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
What's in these Mass

1366
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,551
This is all getting inhaled Indian songs

1367
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
And the little hooks are grabbing onto your lung tissue

1368
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,927
These things are designed to cause

1369
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
Not to help

1370
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
And they do not block

1371
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,559
Virus transmission

1372
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,607
Where we are Alex right now

1373
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
So give me a riddle post with a pictures

1374
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
The game was asking

1375
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,495
It even answer the Declaration that quote

1376
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
We don't know all the

1377
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,847
It's all about making you worried about microscopic

1378
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Images

1379
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,919
And speculating about what they could be well hiding

1380
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,991
Behind a very clear statement that we don't know what these things are

1381
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,063
By Monday Mike Stone had changed

1382
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,671
When was the Declaration that the answers are still on clearance place was this declaration

1383
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,255
It's clear that the masks in Schwab's are transferring

1384
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:08,351
Materials to the body not merely sapling materials are filtering materials

1385
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,935
In other words masculine swabs are themselves medical interventions

1386
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
With unknown health

1387
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,591
It seems like with no new information and no real explanation at all

1388
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615
Micah gone from Quest

1389
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
Straining to definitively stating thing

1390
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,247
And now your duty is on Iowa to show escalating these definitive state

1391
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
Mitsubishi can't backup at all

1392
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,599
This is how the game is played for these people

1393
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
They're Liars

1394
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
And there lies Escalade

1395
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Because that's how you

1396
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Continue to profit

1397
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,255
The well-established game that they've played

1398
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
Many many times

1399
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Can we watch

1400
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,839
Cowboy

1401
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,847
Flooded find them in a restaurant

1402
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:56,479
Like I really don't know how loud I could audits why it's a priority

1403
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,879
It's one of those things Dad where everybody knows up very loud

1404
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
But because I realized

1405
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
I have no idea what

1406
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
The ceiling

1407
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:11,583
Oh you don't know the basketball

1408
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,471
Really let loose I would like to know how loud I could be and if I saw one of these people in a restaurant I think we might

1409
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:23,103
Discover it's like in Mortal Kombat being pushed to your limit to find a time

1410
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,199
Grow mechanical arm

1411
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
So

1412
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,063
You know we got two people getting vaccinated Mike says don't do it

1413
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
Don't do it

1414
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
Doubt

1415
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
Sure sure

1416
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,695
Going to be a dying off

1417
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
Vaccinated people in the fall

1418
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,887
Find something for Humanity who got vaccinated there will only be non-vaccinated people find yep that's

1419
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Kind of it now

1420
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,727
Alistair going to see the hospitals in the fall

1421
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,103
Probably filled with people who are dying from this

1422
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,127
Dependent enhancement

1423
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Side

1424
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
You nailed it

1425
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
If you check

1426
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,927
It's only going to be people who have been vaccinated

1427
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
Better in the hospital's at that time

1428
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
In waves

1429
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,863
It is not a good situation other this is part of the depopulation agenda

1430
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,423
This is play out of the next 2-3 years

1431
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,751
Is no undue

1432
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:29,407
There's no undue

1433
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
Play some

1434
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,623
Miracle

1435
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,439
Bill Gates in the UN have set things in motion now

1436
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
Turn off my

1437
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
You can't turn this back

1438
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Okay well I guess

1439
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
When you're wrong this is

1440
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
Over for Humanity

1441
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,775
I get so frustrated

1442
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,871
With this bunker and whether or not it's setup cuz I change it

1443
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:05,247
Either set up or I haven't finished

1444
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Full of survival food

1445
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
Take off of work

1446
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,999
Corsica is f****** with people

1447
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
It's insane

1448
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:22,655
Also if he's taking off time in the near future I would suspect that it's not because of Bunker preparation

1449
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
It's lawyer

1450
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
I think maybe that

1451
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
That's more more likely it's

1452
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
It's funny how it's almost like a

1453
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
Glitch in humanity

1454
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,407
Where we never really think about how much

1455
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,455
We rely on shame just alike

1456
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:41,087
Living in a society where if you have no shame it's almost like a

1457
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
Glitch in The Matrix like you can just get away with

1458
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Anything

1459
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,719
Because people just assume that a human being

1460
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,047
If they said that he was over for Humanity

1461
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Movie Lone Survivor

1462
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,375
I've been with so wrong they didn't

1463
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
Get to go back on the show for a while

1464
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,471
For them to come back and make

1465
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,799
Similar claims in the opposite direction

1466
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:07,199
Are you human being would feel shame over that here you would think that somebody would be able to regulate themselves if I like

1467
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
I should just

1468
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
Stop listening

1469
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:17,439
Watch it because I think it if you were that wrong the correct response would be to reflect

1470
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
You wanted him to be like

1471
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:23,583
Why was I bad what is it about my method of finding information

1472
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
Discerning truth

1473
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,679
What is it about that that was so wrong

1474
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,983
Is it that I don't have a process

1475
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,775
Oh no that's a problem

1476
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:36,127
You know what happens when you're in when you're making one of those papers

1477
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
For a science for school

1478
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
You know or or

1479
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Go with earlier

1480
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
The Stanford

1481
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Situation

1482
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:49,183
They felt shame attached to it

1483
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
And we can't let it happen

1484
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Right

1485
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
Cuz they were

1486
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
For no reason

1487
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
Mike

1488
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Pretty shity

1489
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Sure

1490
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
Alright I believe the

1491
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
Rapper DMX die from

1492
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Covid vaccine

1493
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
That was in diagnosis a heart attack

1494
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,383
Write this would be an appropriate time for you to bark

1495
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:13,247
Yeah go fuc yourself

1496
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Mouth yet

1497
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:19,647
Get his name on social media but there's no evidence

1498
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,671
The DMX got the

1499
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Covid vaccine

1500
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
And even if he did which

1501
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
They don't even know

1502
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
There's no way you can

1503
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
Approve that

1504
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,071
Contributed.

1505
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
This is just

1506
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
Disgraceful

1507
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,167
One last clip a mic

1508
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:34,239
I hope he's gone for long time

1509
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,079
Tell my parents on your show today

1510
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,871
This is an extermination agenda

1511
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,175
They will come for you

1512
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Sooner or later

1513
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Already

1514
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,271
You need to get out of the blue cities

1515
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
Get out of the blue States

1516
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,111
Get to someplace where you can have some self-reliance

1517
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,439
You need to get real assets because an economically

1518
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
Collapse is coming

1519
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,815
They're going to confiscate all the dollars in bank account

1520
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,655
Get to get scared of everything get out of the Cities get to

1521
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
If they're all the money is gone

1522
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:10,591
So this episode started with Alex Zhang that he was going to switch it up

1523
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
Yorkshire

1524
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,151
No

1525
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
Didn't take any calls

1526
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
I'll talk to you a dumb idiot

1527
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
What's the name I got them

1528
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
Complained very racist Lee about the Oscars you got it human tragedy in a foreign country

1529
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,439
Free zone

1530
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,535
Prophet that's the way to do it that's a real that's a real What would

1531
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
Call that Triple Crown

1532
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
I would say

1533
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,911
For the cycle

1534
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
No

1535
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,727
So we get to the 27

1536
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,751
Starts up

1537
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,311
And totally different man

1538
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
Totally different vibe

1539
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed historic transmission I know I didn't think

1540
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,831
I got deep research and I've had major

1541
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,623
Epiphanies the last

1542
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,159
24-hours movie my bed

1543
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,815
Major Epiphany is in the last 24 hours

1544
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Unabomber

1545
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,655
To then being like the next day I've had some major of hip

1546
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:13,311
It's cuz that makes me feel like you've just escalated your Unabomber planning you're feeling better about it makes me wonder if

1547
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
What's the

1548
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,711
It keeps doing the University

1549
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,343
So many shows begin with

1550
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,415
I had a vision last night

1551
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,975
Spoiler alert

1552
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
You know something

1553
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,303
Really should

1554
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
Annoying

1555
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
Is that

1556
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:43,263
How often he says that he's transcended things

1557
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
You realize that bite

1558
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,383
Any definition of transcending

1559
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,407
You would not be

1560
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,943
We doing your show right

1561
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
You would have stopped yet

1562
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,247
Because you're above

1563
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:01,695
That's how it work if you want to be like so bothered by petty little things

1564
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:08,095
Regina King Oscar's giving a speech

1565
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,495
White identity feared victimhood

1566
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,567
Derek at the office is a real f******

1567
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,871
That's where you're wrong it was

1568
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,687
Okay bus fare

1569
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
Blues man that's why

1570
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
That's what this is such a big

1571
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,063
Here we are

1572
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,903
Very calm here because this is so important and so huge

1573
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
And so illegal

1574
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Over the top

1575
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
That if we just

1576
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,607
What does information out there it'll become normalized

1577
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
We must soak the shin we must cogitate on

1578
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,263
Mold around psychologically spiritually

1579
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
We should pray about this

1580
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
Cuz this is all now

1581
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
Revealing itself

1582
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,199
Coming out the open

1583
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,527
I want to beat up whoever taught him to work cogitate

1584
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
Really annoying

1585
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087

Shutter

1601
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559

1609
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:17,887
Yeah I noticed that I have this little take where I say two things are interesting

1610
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:24,287
Realized

1611
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:32,991
I have news that will shake the foundations of reality it seems almost too easy to point this out buddy

1612
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
If you weren't interested in it

1613
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
It would

1614
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
Be in the shower

1615
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,135
It's true so it is still a little bit

1616
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,207
Here's the first story that Alex

1617
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,743
Alright let's

1618
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:47,071
Let's do this man

1619
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
Rapid fire baby

1620
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,703
We go out until a the master never coming off until you say no

1621
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,495
Bacterial pneumonia

1622
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,543
It's psychologically screws up children

1623
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
But it doesn't protect you

1624
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Call Cindy's now saying that

1625
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
You need to go out

1626
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,551
Walmart

1627
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
You need to stop

1628
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
And he's been too liberal there the point is

1629
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,327
This is child abuse

1630
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:27,263
Walmart okay

1631
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,311
Alright

1632
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,871
Easy just really how quickly the party of

1633
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,151
Personal responsibility

1634
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,199
Turns into the party of

1635
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,039
Children because their parents can't

1636
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Take care of them they're wearing a mask

1637
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,927
Yes stop them from wearing mask

1638
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,023
The party of personal responsibility

1639
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,863
The first story is a Tucker is antimatter

1640
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Great okay

1641
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679

01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,751
Here's the big super supreme enchilada

1643
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
That to enchiladas

1644
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,431
Medical doctors all over the world from Germany to Canada

1645
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,783
Let's say they are being arrested by the police

1646
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:15,647
That's coming up

1647
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
The children are endangered

1648
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,767
In their mental physical and spiritual well-being

1649
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,583
This headline appears

1650
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
On a page

1651
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
On the web

1652
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
Website

1653
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,263
Daily General news.com whatever the f*** that is

1654
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,823
I know that I need to go to the general

1655
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,127
To get some insurance

1656
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,967
Also the one of the problems is that this webpage

1657
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Is no longer there

1658
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:46,111
The 404 page doesn't exist that's a problem snapshot back machine

1659
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,135
And I find all of this

1660
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Quite suspicious

1661
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,487
Interesting Lee I found an article on Gateway pundit

1662
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Clearly about

1663
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,535
The same story but with a

1664
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
Slightly different headline

1665
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
German police ransacked the home of

1666
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:04,287
Judge after he agrees with evidence in court the children are endangered in their mental physical and spiritual well-being

1667
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Location to wear face mask

1668
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
You notice a difference

1669
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
No longer physician

1670
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,943
Yeah that's

1671
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,735
No I think police should read

1672
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
Felicia braids

1673
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:20,159
I can't find any news sources on this that actually find credible of about the story but the narrative is presented on Gateway

1674
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,719
A pundit type Outlet is that this judge named Chris

1675
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
Detmer

1676
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
Had his house rated as

1677
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Retaliation for ruling

1678
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,351
The covid-19 related cautionary measures

1679
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
Like masks

1680
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
Could not be enforced in school

1681
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
It's only related to two schools

1682
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:38,591
In this area

1683
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,639
Happen I think I I can be

1684
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Be comfortable with

1685
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
Something that I've seen on that

1686
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,527
Applicability or

1687
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,343
Good stand-up air to hearing in a higher court that remains an open

1688
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,439
I can't find any information about a possible Ray that I feel

1689
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,255
Believe in something as suspend judgment on this until there's more detail

1690
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
That said

1691
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,863
Alex is telling the wrong version of this story

1692
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,167
He said it's a Doctor Who provided evidence

1693
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,519
The story is that it's a judge who handed down the opinion in the case

1694
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:13,919
I suspect one of the Alexs interns found the story on a site like daily General news before it was fun correctly

1695
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:18,015
So he's reporting the wrong version of that story here

1696
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,063
The big supermassive enchilada

1697
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,415
Great isn't it such like a small emblem of his world

1698
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
I've just like

1699
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,767
This is happening all around the world from Canada to Germany

1700
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
Near like okay

1701
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,863
Hydraulic up their country

1702
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,959
So here's the what's another

1703
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
Chilaquiles right here

1704
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,079
Joe Biden house yesterday he's going to send Aid to India

1705
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,151
It's not vitamin C if not vitamin D

1706
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
Lockdown

1707
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
It's not

1708
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Oxygen bottles

1709
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,879
What

1710
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
Is the population

1711
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Nearest shipping

1712
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,007
Millions of doses

1713
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
Fast food

1714
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,136
First things first the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is actually developed by the Sarah minced

1715
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:27,904
Attitude of India

1716
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,696
Andy's produce there under the name Covey

1717
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
Windshield

1718
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
That vaccine is always been

1719
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,816
Been approved for use in India wasn't one of the country's that's

1720
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
Suspended it

1721
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,120
The reason we're sending a bunch

1722
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,424
India's because in order to make sure the vaccine

1723
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,520
Could get made countries like the United States agreed to purchase a ton of them in advance

1724
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,360
Along the way various countries got to decide which they would approve

1725
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,384
For using their country

1726
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,200
And it resulted in the situation we're in now

1727
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,248
Arnold doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine

1728
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,296
But it's not approved for use in the United States

1729
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
It is effective

1730
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Music nature

1731
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
It's one of their approval

1732
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,184
Send it to them

1733
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
As opposed to letting it go to waste

1734
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
What's good

1735
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
Nonsense all he wants but

1736
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
Not the story

1737
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
It's not that what he

1738
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,472
Do we have one more also it's

1739
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Just to be clear

1740
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
It is not like

1741
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
They're putting them all in

1742
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,104
Boxes right now and they're like

1743
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,712
Getting all these little thyroid millions of vials and all these big boxes there

1744
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
Visa expires they don't even exist yet

1745
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
Okay

1746
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:36,768
So that was the chilaquiles then what are we got a chili relleno I got another another dish Saturday

1747
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Schools around the world

1748
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,144
Experimental

1749
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,192
MRNA gene therapy

1750
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,496
Because it can cause the spread of real

1751
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Viruses

1752
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,336
Not even your precious Wall Street Journal

1753
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
Big

1754
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
Deal

1755
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,064
Ladies and gentlemen this isn't true there was one school

1756
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,368
In Miami called The Center Academy

1757
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,928
That's been vaccinated teachers I'm interacting with students

1758
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:10,560
It's a private school that was opened in 2019 and it appears to be run by nuts so I'm not too surprised to hear

1759
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:16,960
But it's pretty funny that Alex is exaggerating this into a phenomenon where all over the world schools are Banning vaccinated teachers

1760
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
Ridiculous

1761
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,264
Wow

1762
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,032
Man

1763
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,336
You can just be a dum-dum anywhere and Alex

1764
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Will find you

1765
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:28,480
So we had our boy the health Ranger unless episode

1766
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,760
And now we got another

1767
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
How we going to up

1768
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
The game

1769
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:43,584
Off of the internet as we know it

1770
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,888
So he's not banned off the internet as we know it

1771
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,544
He still has a verified account on Twitter banned on the internet as we know it

1772
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,824
If his own pages

1773
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,688
Yeah it's still up there verified confirming that I

1774
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712
Checked out his pint

1775
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:03,040
Sweet Woodruff caption video proof that I'm on a no-fly list

1776
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:06,112
My experience with this is a little bit different

1777
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,928
Here's a little clip that maybe like that or no

1778
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,976
And there's no way I can get on this

1779
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,584
With Southwest

1780
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
But maybe

1781
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
Delta Maybe

1782
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,056
Did they give you a reason

1783
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
It's a no-fly list you said

1784
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,504
Next video coverage

1785
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,320
Tell the truth gets out when you speak out of you take cash

1786
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:40,160
Here's the article from infowars.com

1787
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,464
America first found

1788
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,792
Put on

1789
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,864
And I told him why

1790
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
You were at the Kappa

1791
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
Even in the

1792
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,496
Capital

1793
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,616
Himself at the airport doesn't show the

1794
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,200
I'm saying why or even that he is on a no-fly list so

1795
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:08,320
Weird it's weird it's weird the proof that is being presented doesn't seem to

1796
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,744
Bulshit the time that I saw all that trending nonsense about

1797
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
That what that's all based off of

1798
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
What

1799
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
That he's on a no-fly list

1800
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
His own video

1801
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,544
Am I guess you act will Google talk about a little bit more he was trying to go down to a DeSantis rally and

1802
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
Florida he wasn't allowed to fly

1803
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,408
Better theories as to why

1804
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,456
I want snakes on the show

1805
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,760
But Alex has to spread some other b*******

1806
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,320
They're intimidated

1807
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,672
Witnesses in the show on trial and throwing Pig blood on what they think their house is

1808
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
11 with the mob intimidating

1809
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,448
What do you think you're not he's got to go free I'm G black or white

1810
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Because of that

1811
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
Alex has this story

1812
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,520
Completely wrong

1813
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:06,432
I still see no evidence of any jury intimidation in the Chauvin case but Alex's specifically lying about one comment that was report

1814
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,504
Where did where someone referred to as a Chauvin juror said quote

1815
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
I did not want to go through all the rioting in

1816
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,832
Destruction again and I was

1817
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,624
Concerned about people coming to my house

1818
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
If they were not happy with the verdict

1819
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
Liars like Jack Pacific

1820
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:22,048
Quick started passing it along on social media understory spray pretty far that way

1821
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
It's almost certainly without

1822
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,864
What's the covering as real news here

1823
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:28,960
The problem is that this person wasn't a jury in the juror in the trial

1824
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Choose an alternate

1825
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,288
Play definitely no role in the

1826
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,104
Good sighting of the case and the comment was taken out of

1827
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:40,992
The full context of that quote is her response to a question posed by a local Minneapolis news Outlet

1828
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,784
About whether or not she wanted

1829
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
To be a juror

1830
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,600
I had mixed feelings

1831
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,440
There was a question on the questionnaire about that and I didn't know

1832
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:55,840
Because the reason at that time was obviously I didn't know what the outcome was going to be so I felt like either way the outcome was your go

1833
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,632
Going to disappoint one group or the other

1834
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,192
So I didn't want to go through this whole rioting and destruction

1835
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,216
Then again if you know

1836
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,800
A little concerned about people outside my house if they weren't happy with the verdict

1837
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:08,128
Discussing the idea whether or not she wanted to be

1838
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Epoch time

1839
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,200
Totally reasonable fears

1840
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,504
Stu has been Twisted by

1841
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,368
Liars like Jack the soba can be misreported by Alex in order to try and argue for

1842
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Getting

1843
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
Chauvin

1844
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
Of course

1845
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
Because of course

1846
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,792
So are we get to Nick Williams

1847
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:30,144
I just do that cuz Alex likes to pronounce his name

1848
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,192
That hard you and I

1849
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,776
And he's going to tell the story of

1850
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
What happened to him

1851
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
Airport

1852
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:43,712
And I will say that I don't know I don't know if this did happen it certainly not in the video labeled

1853
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,016
Proof that I'm on a no-fly list

1854
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
This is his proof you think it's

1855
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
Be in the video story

1856
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,672
It sounds like the story that someone like him would tell

1857
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
But it certainly doesn't match that

1858
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
Wow

1859
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,024
Cuz she said you know is there anything

1860
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,400
American before

1861
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,496
Nothing like American Airlines

1862
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,800
I've been flying pretty recently

1863
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,616
She said okay well I'll give them another call

1864
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,432
And they relay the same message I'm not able to

1865
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:18,272
You know honestly the political guy

1866
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112
Because I'm not supposed to say that

1867
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:28,512
Stuff is out of control and corporations

1868
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:35,680
Yeah sure okay psycho these are absolute

1869
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
Absolutely

1870
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
Lunatic

1871
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:44,128
This is not the video but this is the story

1872
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
He goes to United

1873
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,968
I guess what this isn't in the video either Comstock

1874
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,296
From someone from Southwest

1875
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,648
I went over to United I went all the way over to the other terminal I booked

1876
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,952
10:40 a.m.

1877
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
To Palm Beach from O'Hare

1878
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,328
I went up to the counter and she told me the exact same thing she was on the phone with

1879
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
The TSA for half hour

1880
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
I'm sorry

1881
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
And she goes and you know what I just Googled you

1882
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,008
And I think I know why that is that's what she said

1883
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
I'm so sorry but

1884
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:18,176
Can I go to the TSA

1885
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,456
Nobody could talk

1886
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
Talk to that's it

1887
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,320
So I'm on the no-fly list and

1888
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,600
Capitol on January 6th

1889
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,904
Okay I don't see

1890
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,512
Indication that any of this is real.

1891
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,304
Suggest

1892
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
A bunch of nonsense

1893
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,376
No but I should get at a

1894
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Text alert if I know he's in Chicago

1895
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,496
He lives in Chicago I know but like where I can

1896
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
You know

1897
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:51,456
You know what I'm saying like Homeland on Prime is sending me something right now

1898
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,296
I'm not going to say what it is Amazon Prime free with this if

1899
01:28:55,552 --> 01:29:01,696
The only use of that information is avoiding wherever he is absolutely

1900
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:06,048
Been like this kind of talk man

1901
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,584
Recaps Nick Story

1902
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,144
Two giant assumption

1903
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
Spell in here

1904
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,776
No fly list they admit it's because you weren't

1905
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,872
So no fly list

1906
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,664
Recovering the capital

1907
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
Those are the assumptions

1908
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:26,528
Right there's no reason to suspect that Nick is on a no-fly list because of the event

1909
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
January 6th

1910
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,880
A lot of folks might have forgotten by now but

1911
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
In December 2020 nickname

1912
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,536
Big deal online about getting kicked off a plane for not wearing his mask correctly

1913
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,096
I told the guy on the plane. f***

1914
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
You and eat s***

1915
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Bat-Mite

1916
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,168
I have something

1917
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
Things to do with it

1918
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,032
You were in that first clip that Nick was talking to that is it something to do with masks

1919
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,872
Obviously cuz you got kicked off a plane Alex months ago

1920
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:58,528
I don't know if he's on a no-fly list I would assume he's not since the simpler explanation is that he's a public figure

1921
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,624
Who made a big deal out of an altercation he initiated on a plane

1922
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,904
6 months ago

1923
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
Stunt

1924
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
Yes I would say that maybe Airlines alike

1925
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,328
How about that wasn't on my Airline

1926
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,632
I would maybe not let him on

1927
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Based on

1928
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,424
Soda public

1929
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,312
I don't want to deal with that I don't know you have the right to refuse service to assholes so why would you want that

1930
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,104
Even the possibility of that happen

1931
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,968
Coming against you know that he's a provocateur

1932
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,016
Didn't happen is really funny

1933
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,064
Him trying to be like oh is there a mask

1934
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,416
No I said

1935
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,488
It is next clip Alex

1936
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,280
Channels Reagan

1937
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,328
In a very inspirational Way You Are

1938
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,984
Ronald Reagan

1939
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
Call Matt Walsh

1940
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:00,992
Figure

1941
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:05,856
Not mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall I say

1942
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:10,208
Biden tear off that mask off your dirty bandit face

1943
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,024
I don't think that's going to resonate through time

1944
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
Inspiring

1945
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,608
This is inspiring

1946
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,680
To be one of those that you know when those montages where they do like

1947
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,240
All the greatest Generation kind of s***

1948
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,312
And they go through all that and because there's a big most to history

1949
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,592
That is going

1950
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,944
50 years old I'm 50 years from now that will be in the real

1951
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,504
Show me your dirty Bandit

1952
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,600
Do wrong

1953
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,392
So Alex at this point talk

1954
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,440
What's to a Canadian

1955
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
Preacher

1956
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,256
Who's had the police show up

1957
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
A couple times

1958
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Because he's not following covid

1959
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,352
It's not the

1960
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,680
The same Canadian Churchill we talked about

1961
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,216
How many Skippers cuz it's it's

1962
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Who cares

1963
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
Another

1964
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,824
If you're free to go. Infowars Europe

1965
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,152
Piece of s***

1966
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,224
We have also Alex

1967
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,760
Just getting into this weird thing released

1968
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
Planing about

1969
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:09,856
The last enjoyed they're all they're all demons out

1970
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
I'll describe yoy

1971
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:17,024
Friendly's with their masks and I see them with their hatred in their pedophilia and

1972
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,096
Left into evil now

1973
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,656
Little superhero the kind of mid-level

1974
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,472
A leftist is Robert two purposes

1975
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,592
A devil worshipping Google I don't know what's happened to him

1976
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,040
All the main cities

1977
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Black matter

1978
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:47,488
Do dinner even the low-level if this is just

1979
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,560
Trickling down just be like the top level is.

1980
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
No now we're all demons

1981
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,912
Every single one of us. Good and we're gone

1982
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,984
For us

1983
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,824
Thing that can be done for us dad

1984
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,592
Bat-Mite

1985
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
You know

1986
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,640
It doesn't

1987
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,944
So

1988
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,736
The beginning of this episode.

1989
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Albertsons

1990
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,040
Promise you had an epiphany

1991
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
Skip 24

1992
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
Stacks of paper

1993
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,928
I haven't gotten one today

1994
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,048
Jame I mean

1995
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
Take it over

1996
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,848
By the way we don't find ourselves and won't be here

1997
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,176
A lot

1998
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,992
Avenue Great t-shirts get through those

1999
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
24 stacks

2000
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:45,088
You know what a certain point I think you would recognize

2001
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,112
That like

2002
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
I never get through the

2003
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
First Act

2004
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,976
Maybe two stacks is the max

2005
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:57,632
Everybody needs a little setback you're delusional

2006
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:04,032
Many of them have that bike on the desk you know they're wearing

2007
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,080
Lapel mics

2008
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,152
It's like you okay do you prepare a meal for yourself right

2009
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,688
And every night you make

2010
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,736
Temp service

2011
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Through

2012
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
Three-quarters of one and then your eye

2013
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,344
Play all their food

2014
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
Event

2015
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:22,208
Next day you're like all I got all this food here is it going to be great I got all this food

2016
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,024
You get through maybe half of a service time

2017
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,816
Cuz baby you're not hungry that night

2018
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:32,192
There is a there is a paper mill in Oregon that relies on Alex

2019
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,752
Exclusively that brings me to my next point

2020
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
He better be f******

2021
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
Recycling

2022
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,640

2026
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,904

Filmmaker one of the first big survivalist on the top

2028
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:02,400
Survivalist

2029
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
Thought some of the

2030
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,568
Who's a little extreme well now

2031
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,848
It looks like

2032
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
He's been

2033
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Dead on

2034
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:16,992
What are those extreme conclusions

2035
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
You know what here's my new pet

2036
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:24,416
Here's my new pitched and all right before these assholes get to say a goddamn word about being a survivalist

2037
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,184
You have

2038
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,976
To go on Naked and Afraid win

2039
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:34,656
That is it if you call yourself a grill

2040
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,216
I don't think Steve would make it

2041
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,776
So I love that Steve was on

2042
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,568
Because I've been

2043
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,360
Play this clip for you

2044
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,480
Sequel was recently on the Jim Bakker Show

2045
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,064
Just this clip I was going to make an episode out of it

2046
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:59,488
So boring

2047
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
Find it you are thankfully rightwingwatch

2048
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,304

01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:06,656
Particular clip where dude get ready

2050
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:12,544
Steve Quayle for giving us an excuse Mike down okay have your mind blown by Jim Bakker and Steve Quayle

2051
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
Zombies

2052
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,384
That are on the Earth

2053
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:22,528
Are disease like any other disease that affects people and they become like

2054
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
Zombies

2055
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,320
Is that right

2056
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
Forgive me but that's only part

2057
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,672
Two-story zombies

2058
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,208
A zombies also have the

2059
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Evil

2060
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
Spiritual entity known as demon possession

2061
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:34,816
Okay

2062
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,632
Because there is no rationale

2063
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,912
With a zombie

2064
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:44,032
The best way to explain zombies blood loss desserts

2065
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,592
The appetite of demons Express real human

2066
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:52,480
It should be astonishing the people that the richest people in the world not all of them but some of them

2067
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,784
Are into a call ceremonies

2068
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,064
Where they have

2069
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,088
Did you know

2070
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
Blood

2071
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Bats

2072
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,160
That's extract

2073
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
From a tortured child

2074
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Abasi

2075
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
Appetite

2076
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
Demons Express true human

2077
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,144
The ancient world

2078
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,192
With monsters mythology

2079
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
Call Andrea

2080
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,520
And this is something that is

2081
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,288
Really

2082
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,824
Important to get through

2083
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
V

2084
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Disease

2085
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,176
Basically

2086
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,712
Destroy

2087
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,248
The human defense

2088
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,296
God gave us the fastest human

2089
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,088
To resist the devil and he will flee

2090
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
When your

2091
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,416
Inviting

2092
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
What's the word I want

2093
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,744
Embrace

2094
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
Abject

2095
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
Demon possession

2096
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,096
Giving yourself over

2097
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,120
2

2098
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
B & habitat

2099
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,448
Bebe

2100
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,520
By the demons who them become your inhabited

2101
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,336
It's a too full what I'm saying Jim

2102
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
Yes they can induce

2103
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
Zombie-ism at least the appetite

2104
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,248
At the end of the thing it's

2105
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
Both hands right hand

2106
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,856
Simply is

2107
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,416
The evil spiritual possession

2108
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
That

2109
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
Zombie

2110
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:11,584
Steve Quayle just this month was on Jim Bakker Show

2111
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,608
Wow

2112
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:19,776
I do appreciate how much of Christianity does seem to get their idea of the

2113
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,080
World from like the hellblazer comic

2114
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,640
John Constantine is also a

2115
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
A factor

2116
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:29,248
In Jim Baker's reality I would love that conversation

2117
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:33,344
Taking place outside of a televangelist studio

2118
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,624
Disgusting

2119
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,952
What does make a zombie a zombie

2120
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:44,352
Maybe have that conversation

2121
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:50,752
Zombie Baker and Steve Quayle

2122
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Position on that

2123
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
What

2124
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,104
F****** weirdo

2125
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,456
This is spam

2126
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,576
Christian's all uniformly be like

2127
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,880
We can't be associated with this

2128
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:09,952
Because if we really do allow zombies

2129
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,536
People are going to put that together with the rest of the bulshit We Believe

2130
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,584
Other be like maybe Christianity stupid

2131
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,168
Or you know like meme that Jesus a zombie

2132
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:25,568
Exactly it's like okay if you start the if you start adding too many mythical elements into it at

2133
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Especially ones

2134
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,152
That are referenced in Night of the Living fukka

2135
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,456
King dead what your best

2136
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
Best order of business

2137
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,528
Is if your religion

2138
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:39,392
Don't incorporate any universal monsters

2139
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,160
No Mommy

2140
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:46,048
At no point in time to Jesus say we're coming to get you Barbara no Dracula that's not going to happen

2141
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,376
So anyway I don't respect Steve Quayle

2142
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,424
At all no

2143
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,776
And so we just have a series of him saying things and talking to Alex that I have

2144
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,568
No interested

2145
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:00,640
Tree that's real

2146
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,664
Consideration

2147
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,968
You think zombies are real

2148
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,784
Depopulation agenda

2149
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,832
This is what's really important

2150
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Ladies and

2151
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,392
This is all about one thing

2152
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,696
It's about the depopulation the world

2153
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,232
From 7.9 billion

2154
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,912
That's a reference to the Georgia Guidestones with Bradley

2155
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
Steve Quayle believes

2156
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,984
Sorry live

2157
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
Sir

2158
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,544
I do love how

2159
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,312
The globalist

2160
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,104
Love around number that

2161
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,128
It's easy for

2162
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,688
Ridiculous idiots to understand

2163
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Convenient

2164
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,016
How ridiculous idiots are always given

2165
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,552
Nice round number

2166
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
That's great

2167
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:47,488
It's great so that no one can ever find

2168
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
Certainly proved a lot of stuff

2169
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Steve does to

2170
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,984
Got the sense from listening to this that Alex's whole story about him seeing fish people with human eyes

2171
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,008
Story crib

2172
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:02,336
From Steve

2173
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Interviewed

2174
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,688
One of the Intel world's most famous

2175
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
Assassins

2176
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,088
How do you say laboratory summon the most Seeker

2177
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Places

2178
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,720
Deep underwater in the jungles

2179
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:19,744
Borneo

2180
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,608
I've seen things in kg

2181
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,400
Half human half

2182
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,472
By the way the lion men of Moab

2183
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,752
Liberty

2184
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:34,336
But he said these creatures were calling out to me

2185
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,640
Help me help me I'm human

2186
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,920
Any start a week

2187
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,712
This is a CIA guy

2188
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
But there was a human

2189
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
Stop

2190
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,720
Makes a stick in my spirit

2191
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,024
Okay so your story

2192
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
That you're telling me

2193
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,352
One of the best assassins

2194
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,632
One of the best assassin

2195
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,424
For the CIA someone

2196
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Who's the best

2197
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,240
Killing me

2198
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
People yes

2199
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,360
And especially for the CIA so you know there's no morality within this person

2200
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,944
I wouldn't assume so if the other details of this

2201
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,968
The story are correct

2202
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
What is Breaking Point

2203
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:17,088
Panera Bread

2204
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,112
Was

2205
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,416
Half man half man half life

2206
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,208
By the way

2207
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,488
No reason

2208
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,256
No reason

2209
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
What's the weather

2210
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:32,192
To a dandelion memorable apps no cuz these are genetically created now right not the lion

2211
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,544
Reconstitute the goddamn lion Manuel

2212
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:43,200
You know that might be part of his argument in my blood

2213
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,480
Steve's argument

2214
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Is

2215
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
That is

2216
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:53,184
Biblical times before the flood they were making human-animal hybrids

2217
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,512
Emmett history is repeating itself now

2218
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
That's where we're at

2219
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
Yeah

2220
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:05,216
Yep so anyway if you're a Christian you got a cop to The Lion Man that you believe that lie in Metairie

2221
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,312
So

2222
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,896
Look there's some similarities

2223
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,968
Between what zombies alignment already in

2224
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,736
Steve Quayle

2225
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,064
Okay

2226
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,392
Some similarities

2227
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,440
Between with Steve believe

2228
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,720
And let's say

2229
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,000
Today we insure

2230
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,536
Could be he thinks that there's a

2231
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:31,840
The difference

2232
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,144
Between

2233
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,912
Exposition

2234
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:41,312
Is my position is

2235
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,872
Before Noah's flood

2236
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,688
Incorrupt

2237
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:52,832
Now we are seeing in The Book of Enoch that people used to say wasn't true

2238
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,880
But it got leaked out

2239
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
The Weeknd

2240
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
The Dead Sea Scrolls

2241
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,424
What

2242
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:14,080
Anyway yes Steve breaks off from Ancient Aliens

2243
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,872
You love

2244
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,896
I do love

2245
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,920
The combination of

2246
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,944
Defensiveness

2247
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,480
Confidence in his position

2248
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:24,832
Wild Thing something so abject Lee ridiculous

2249
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:30,976
You are trying to be taken seriously and you need to clarify your position against the Ancient Aliens position

2250
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,048
You're underwater man

2251
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,352
Look these Ancient Aliens people are crazy

2252
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
I believe

2253
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,656
That before the flood

2254
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,704
Aliens came down

2255
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,240
That's stupid

2256
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,032
See what happened is Before the Flood

2257
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:49,920
Interdimensional Angels came down and built the pyramids shows up

2258
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:57,088
This fiddling around with human and animal of the hybrids and what have you created

2259
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,392
Right

2260
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,928
What's going on

2261
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Golden time

2262
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,512
And it's going on again

2263
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,632
I'll just let this Blake

2264
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,936
The Human Genome Project

2265
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
What's to ID

2266
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,800
Angel

2267
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
Have sex with Earth women

2268
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
Produced a hybrid hybrid

2269
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,736
World of Warships

2270
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
Obviously

2271
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Now

2272
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:30,368
We're coming to that point where we're messing with genetics

2273
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,416
So I see you scribbling notes

2274
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,720
I just I just want to make sure that

2275
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Forever

2276
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,816
Throughout all of history written down in this notebook

2277
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,376
Is the Human Genome Project was about

2278
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:48,288
Ameri clarifying the Nephilim DNA or whatever

2279
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:53,664
Sure that no matter what happens what it was all about man the Human Genome Project

2280
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,688
Who's trying to find

2281
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,712
Thor

2282
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Trying to find

2283
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
Heracles

2284
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,600
Make

2285
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,904
Since I really really

2286
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
It like

2287
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,976
And I I mean this

2288
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,512
With

2289
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
All

2290
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,816
Non respect

2291
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,376
This is sad even for Alec

2292
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,704
Text to listen to

2293
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,032
Yeah cuz it goes against his interdimensional theory

2294
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,848
I think that all of its own on

2295
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:29,248
Specific that you you have a really hard time

2296
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:37,696
That's a good I think you should keep that in your backpack I understand that because you work from sort of a grounded place of reality

2297
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:41,024
Speedpaint

2298
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,328
Yeah I think they could make this work

2299
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
If it matters

2300
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,984
When you have no shame it's like a glitch in humanity you can figure it out

2301
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,752
Yep

2302
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:54,336
Steve is this guy who like I really think

2303
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,152
That I mean we've listened to him a little bit in the past

2304
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
And he has

2305
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,992
Worst version of think

2306
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,272
He's a prophet than out

2307
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Like

2308
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,576
He legit emedley is

2309
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
Just like I know all God

2310
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,208
Story is that God gave him a vision of everything but

2311
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:14,048
These things up

2312
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,096
Justice like

2313
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
This clip

2314
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,424
I think is just a guy doing an impression of a prophet

2315
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
The day will come

2316
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,288
Mark my words when even vitamin

2317
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,080
Will be made it illegal

2318
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,616
Possession of item

2319
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,480
Speak in the name of Jesus

2320
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,504
Capital offense

2321
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,064
Everything is going to be a cat

2322
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Our schedule

2323
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,696
To be terminated

2324
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,744
Terminated

2325
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,792
I would like to mark his words about

2326
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,328
Possession of vitamins

2327
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
Becoming

2328
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,912
B12 get it out of there

2329
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,216
Summary execution

2330
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,008
If you have riboflavin

2331
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:59,104
Vitamins in just food

2332
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
You can't have it

2333
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:05,248
Are you talking about regulations for the supplement industry

2334
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:08,064
And I think that's something that terrifies you more than

2335
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
Anything in the world

2336
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
Little bit different

2337
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:13,440
This is a nonsensical interview with

2338
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:18,304
Who has a bunch of really stupid ideas about dumb s***

2339
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
Was about

2340
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
Angels

2341
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
Great

2342
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,400
Also zombie scientist

2343
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,704
Bobby's got together

2344
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,520
We can't not know about these angels

2345
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,544
Who f***** women

2346
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:32,128
In the past to create Thor we just can't not know

2347
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,712
Zombies zombies are also in play

2348
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
And all this is gray

2349
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
But

2350
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,648
I think there might be ulterior motives to this interview

2351
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,720
This clip

2352
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:50,816
Took off my headphones and walk out over yourself

2353
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,864
I want to talk about

2354
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,912
A work phone

2355
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,448
I don't think you

2356
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:02,336
You know that we're having trouble finding ourselves you said listen is one of the best deals that I sponsor someone for many years

2357
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,808
It's not why you're here you just mention a new function

2358
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
Excited about osher sorry you got me a satellite

2359
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:22,048
Talking about your dumbass ideas

2360
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,328
Wow

2361
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:29,728
Wow Alex you're really willing to let him go that long just so you can sell a satellite phone for you

2362
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,264
Yeah that's not good

2363
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,080
I don't know what the deal is here with the

2364
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,640
This phone exactly but

2365
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,920
Infowars phone.

2366
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,712
Redirect

2367
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:42,528
Stewart website satellite phone store

2368
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,808
I don't know if they have it

2369
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:50,208
Infowars promotion going on but if they do they're keeping Infowars and Alex's name the f*** off at

2370
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:57,632
I don't I don't know what's going on I guess Steve Quayle got him a sponsor and now

2371
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
Getting meeting

2372
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:01,216
For that company whenever they're getting together having like

2373
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
Okay

Sound on the hook for about 5k

2377
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
Alex Jones

2378
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
From Infowars

2379
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
Are we

2380
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,784
Are we there yet

2381
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,600
Are we that far.

2382
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,952
We'll take the only explanation

2383
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,768
That's outrageous although I do think there is a a certain

2384
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,304
Delicious

2385
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,328
Of the

2386
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,376
Trajectory of a guitar

2387
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:31,936
Just saying the stupidest s***

2388
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:37,312
You are feeling bad for that day off of courses

2389
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,896
Well I really really feel bad now

2390
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,944
Jim Bakker

2391
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
That satellite

2392
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,504
The phone sponsor

2393
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:50,368
That would explain his recent airtime is a middleman

2394
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,160
Hey I get you this

2395
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,208
You get me some air.

2396
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
Yep

2397
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,560
Anyway Jordan this has been an exploration of the

2398
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:02,656
The beginning of the week on Alta show I'm excited to see the response

2399
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
Monster the Giuliani real

2400
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:07,520
And I apologize if we don't have that on this episode of it is just too much

2401
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
With this

2402
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
With this bulky

2403
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,360
Bulshit but Alex is doing

2404
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:17,248
No we're either going to have to focus a lot on the Giuliani raid or it's going to be one of those things where he mentions it

2405
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:23,648
Says that it's unfair and then does not speak of it anymore might say that it's the end of the world and he might not talk about it at all

2406
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:27,232
Range is Uno's

2407
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:30,560

2413
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,600
