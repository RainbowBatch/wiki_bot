He's a weirdo

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
On Christmas

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,688
It's be expected a weirdo

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Before we start the show to give a couple thank you was out there

26
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
To folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
First of all I'd like to say

28
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Not Alex Jones

29
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720

Thank you so much Christy thank you very much if you would like to show we would appreciate

00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
Now, I should tell you

45
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Skip this chair

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Two chairs for

47
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,760
I got another gift that is a gift and a curse in a responsibility

48
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
We received donations bumped into our neck patreon

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,792
Terrified

50
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
To put this out to the world

51
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
People have been requesting

52
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
That I write a book

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
Or we write a book about Alex

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
For that matter

55
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
There's not as much as utility in this podcast as I would like there to be

56
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Well yeah for the people to get the information that we're putting out into the world have to listen to a lot of our podcast

57
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,232
To get the information

58
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
223

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
It's not

60
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,263
Not is the most digestible usable application presentation of the information that we're

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Uncovering in the

62
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
That that we're learning about

63
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
Answer one of the things people have suggested was that book idea

64
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
You and I are Leon

65
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
We're interested in the idea of it

66
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,695
There wasn't a way to make it engaging and

67
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Informative book

68
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
It wouldn't take us both our entire life

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Or whatever

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,143
Probably killing each other because of the meetings about

71
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543
Meat using the passive voice

72
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
And then I would scribble in screams in the margins

73
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
Where to go

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
Around the idea of like what other ways would there be to present the information in a way that

75
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Could use like

76
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
Let's say you're having an argument with somebody

77
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Narrative

78
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,191
Chip

79
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
Listen to 45 minutes

80
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Debunking of x

81
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,359
Hotwire

82
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Sure and hopefully maybe

83
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
It's not it's not the most helpful

84
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Answer what I decided to do is I decided to start building

85
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,903
I started to do that and I realize I don't like

86
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
The wiki structure

87
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Necessarily

88
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
I find it very difficult

89
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
To manage

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Unwieldy

91
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,119
But I've begun and Don Most

92
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Work is never good

93
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
To be done

94
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
I've created a database more lies

95
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Infowars

96
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
It's a work in progress

97
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
But because we've crossed this goal I will start

98
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,831
I'll start making it available on knowledge fight.com

99
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
I hope

100
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
By the first

101
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
My goal is the first of the year it'll go by

102
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
That's what is the

103
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
The timeframe of lead-up that I probably need

104
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
A few things

105
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Hollister

106
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,471
What have you got on now it's right. Combat

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
We'll go to our

108
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,663
Tons of information

109
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
A large portion of my time over Christmas

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
Compiling and writing

111
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Esoteric

112
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
I am grateful to

113
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
Level mainly because Dan has been writing this

114
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
For forever

115
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
And if you had

116
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
I don't think he ever would have until he was like

117
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
5 probably

118
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Fairly right I would kick

119
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
The can down the road or need to do

120
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
From the jump

121
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135

122

Armoire

124
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
The times that we've studied

125
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Like 2009

126
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703

Are going to be a lot more of that but it won't only be that time goes on I'm going to

130
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
To continue

131
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
To add to

132
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
These databases

133
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Stuff like that

134
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
Much more thorough

135
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
It's it's whatever Institute

136
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Wow

137
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
That's an unfair comparison

138
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Anyways everybody

139
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Force my hand on this

140
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
We'll see

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
But that that is

142
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
Is, what is to come today

That's out the middle of nowhere

195
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
Every detail of

196
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,383
Read story except for this problem

197
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
Literally nowhere

198
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I don't know

199
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Alex hot dog

200
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Or Nacho

201
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
First of all

202
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
Hours early are you

203
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Goddamn

204
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
Movie theater

205
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:36,127
That was a gas station

206
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
For five years

207
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
A lot of x

208
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
It is

209
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Is that he is

210
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Telling this story

211
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Other than to like

212
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Preemptively make sure his wife thinks

213
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Wasn't going to the park

214
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
Wasn't drinking by a dumpster

215
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
It's fascinating to me

216
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,335
Depending on what narratives and what sort of feeling he needs his audience

217
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
He will tell

218
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Almost identical stories

219
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Sbat

220
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
I went out in public and everyone Bob.

221
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
They were calling him a Russian

222
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
All the time

223
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
But they're either angry at him or love him depending on

224
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Ingredients

225
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Inspire hope

226
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
It's almost like he has these paranoid projection

227
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Things that are dependent on how he

228
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
He's feeling at the time like

229
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,847
Feeling good he's with his family they're enjoying Christmas

230
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Surrounding him in there they're giving him nothing

231
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
He's feeling bad like

232
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
He just met with his lawyer

233
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
Evil people left it

234
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
Paranoid projection Theory might be right because

235
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,911
Talkin about this in this nightclub he says things that I think are even left like

236
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
First one

237
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
There was Hysteria

238
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
Elvis Presley was there something

239
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
2 hours

240
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
National Airport

241
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,527
Zeitgeist

242
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
What's going on

243
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Merry Christmas

244
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
Flight attendants

245
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
The PlayStation

246
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
Such Liars

247
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
So the notion that he's walking around the Denver International Airport and people are it's like

248
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Copa b-sides

249
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
And the people are walking up to him

250
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Under their breath

251
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Keep it up

252
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
I think you probably

253
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,615
Some of that yellow

254
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Also by the way

255
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,015
Having people say Merry Christmas to you Wednesday are in the service industry

256
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Surprise eggs

257
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,463
Or even the pilot door open

258
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
Stuff

259
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Is. Like

260
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Flirtatious

261
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
If not it does

262
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
Is white supremacist code

263
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Easy to break

264
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
That is that is not the windtalkers

265
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Is that we're dealing with

266
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
Your code for being cool is like

267
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Merry Christmas

268
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Bro

269
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
You got me alright

270
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
And the world is like

271
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Fine whatever

272
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
So Alex you may be bored

273
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
The rest of the world

274
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Crows

275
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
The real

276
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
That's all good and well

277
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Call Alex

278
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Was out of town

279
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Please car

280
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
That is light him to

281
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
Very weird moved here on Christmas Eve

282
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,119
I was driving to work has gone to the ER

283
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
Who would have been driving your car

284
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
Your kids are not old enough to drive your wife was with you

285
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
Your real wife was with you

286
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,455
Closest King Sooper

287
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Serious

288
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,599
Where I found it but there was one

289
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
That's a little all over the place but you know

290
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
Someone stole his car and put it on a

291
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
If you are backing

292
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,303
I'm song Happy Christmas War is Over

293
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Said that he's curious about it

294
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Cuz he's left his

295
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
They are supposed to hate

296
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
Stop War

297
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Fruit amore

298
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Here's my issue with the

299
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Haha

300
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
And you get in there.

301
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
And you noticed ER is on

302
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
And then you listen to a couple

303
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
That means that NPR is shifted to a FM for Matt and I are just playing Christmas songs in a play

304
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
Supposed to be in like all things considered

305
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,479
So we'll get into the war thing here in a minute

306
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Cuz that's nonsense

307
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Particularly

308
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Fuse by the scrimmage

309
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
Justice Reform things correctly Alex

310
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
To take on the criminal justice

311
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Reform Bill

312
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Was that

313
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Put all this language in there

314
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
It specifically said we're going to keep black

315
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
People specifically in jail for three times as long

316
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,151
Before

317
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Fixed it

318
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Using his

319
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Incredible power

320
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
To understand legislatively

321
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
The first absolute good thing the bipartisan legislation passed

322
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,119
That would work to ease mandatory minimum sentences work harder and Rehabilitation of offenders instead of punishing

323
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
To give Trump any credit

324
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,799
Leftist

325
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
I've been pushing for for a long time

326
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
And actually

327
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Obama's term

328
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
The new law called the first step Act

329
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,879
Retroactively applies changes Congress made to drug sentencing laws

330
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
20/10

331
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
Which experts

332
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Between 4000

333
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
6000 prisoners

334
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
To immediately qualify for

335
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Supervised release

336
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
That is to say that in 2010

337
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
That

338
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Stalked

339
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
By the variance

340
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
For like Kraken

341
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,480
Under Obama in 2010

342
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
Just passed what this bill does

343
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
First Step Act

344
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
It is really good as it makes

345
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
The Retro black

346
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
So that is a very positive

347
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Really just

348
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Extension

349
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Already

350
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Long before Trump people

351
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
On the way

352
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Pushing for

353
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
For quite a while

354
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
The reason for the varying sentences

355
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
For Coke and crack goes back to the anti-drug Abuse Act

356
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
86

357
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
After being passed overwhelmingly by

358
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
The bipartisan

359
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
It was like 9

360
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Percent above the house

361
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
Where is your people

362
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
Jamming up that

363
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
The inner cities that was a Republican or Democrat initiative inasmuch as

364
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,032
The Congress

365
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
Name of both parties

366
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,688
This bill

367
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
Touted as one of the bills I really

368
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Is it a band

369
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Pregnant prison

370
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
But that was a practice that is already been banned by the Bureau of Prisons

371
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
2008

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
Conversation

373
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
In the building

374
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
Wasn't already taken care of

375
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
It was by the Bureau of Prisons

376
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,616
More f***** up to realize that it wasn't

377
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
But it's not

378
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Who knows how well I bet they were

379
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Doing a great job of following the guideline

380
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
It's good to put that into law

381
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
But it wasn't you

382
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,488
Boy Scouts head

383
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
It is good but it's also not nearly enough

384
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,936
The actually relates to federal prisoners and does literally nothing

385
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,008
260 wrongful incarceration

386
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
Far far more people locked up in

387
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Obs

388
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
2.3 million prisoners

389
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
There are in this country

390
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
Only 180,000

391
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Federal Prison

392
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,320
Over two-thirds of whom are not even eligible for this program

393
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Which makes the Axiom possibly

394
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
Eclipse service to the private prison

395
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
All in all

396
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
Support the Trump did nothing

397
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
To make happen

398
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
Is anything the argument should be that Jared Kushner pushed

399
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,472
Does Alex wants to play

400
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,800
The reality is the opportunity to attach himself to something

401
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
Universally popular cost him nothing

402
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Could you through the day

403
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
So he did just that

404
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
No further

405
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Alex should not be in favor of the first step act based on his principal

406
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Excludes offenders who use firearms in

407
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Committing their offenses

408
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
You should believe that this is an unfair.

409
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Guns in jail

410
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
You were caught selling crack

411
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Can you had a

412
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
You're not eligible for the

413
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Benefits that will come from

414
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Alucard

415
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,432
Plus the Congressional budget

416
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
The plan will cost taxpayers

417
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
346 million over the next

418
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Because the released will be eligible for benefits

419
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
If Obama did something like this

420
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,840
Streets of criminals in order to set off social unrest

421
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Issue

422
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
I'm bringing it up

423
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Because that's the way Alex

424
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
What is rhetoric

425
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Generally work

426
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Obviously

427
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
The amount you'll save and not incarcerate

428
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,832
What makes up for the 3rd

429
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
He would use that number against Obama is

430
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
If you had a f****** chicken

431
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Instantly

432
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
So anyway

433
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
Say actually

434
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
That number is

435
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
It's going to cost

436
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
The taxpayers

437
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
Billions upon billions of dollars a year

438
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Right

439
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
But somehow the Federal Reserve is to

440
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Actually that is

441
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Who knows

442
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Expense

443
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
A large portion

444
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
To give Trump credit

445
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
He's the best

446
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
Even if you're a liberal you got to love video

447
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:15,168
You're going to do is me

448
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,288
Heard about Law and Order In

449
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Sing people being

450
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
It so short shorts

451
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Anyways

452
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
The Central Park five

453
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
But

454
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
We don't want to appear weak

455
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Strong

456
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,960
It's like I hate something

457
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Boats

458
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
I don't know

459
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Do you have that like

460
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Democrats are

461
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
That later but

462
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Credible

463
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Alex

464
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Love drop

465
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
He's not getting off the train

466
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
Yeah he's still on board real hard

467
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,056
My reputation is amazing is that come from the exact same people

468
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,360
Call America anti-communist

469
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Operation

470
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
Organic American people

471
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
The challenge

472
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,936
Remove

473
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:58,592
Our fingers around their throats

474
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:12,672
Merry Christmas

475
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:24,960
The name of our dear Lord's birthday I just want to let everybody know even though we are

476
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
We will choke the life

477
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,920
Message of Christ

478
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
So far we got lying about Criminal Justice Reform screaming about killing the globalists and prayer

479
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,160
About getting a hot dog in Tulsa Oklahoma

480
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
Wyomissing

481
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
This is the Christmas Eve Apple

482
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Is that right

483
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
I'd be fair Christmas Eve

484
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Everyday

485
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Put the present under the tree

486
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384
Intuit

487
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,736
Start and then you get festive later

488
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
He's getting it all out of

489
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,368
So when he goes home

490
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
But also

491
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Merry Christmas

492
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Instead of screaming about how

493
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
What makes for a better

494
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Extension

495
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Consistent

496
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
So he talks about how he's going to do

497
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Which is not

498
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Spells out what comes next

499
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
95%

500
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
Another battle in front of him

501
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Close

502
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
He's mentioned

503
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
Is before but just the way he says it is really fun

504
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,520
North Pole

505
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
Levels

506
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:33,216
Next level

507
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,592
OK Google

508
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
Secrets of the universe.

509
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
Raising your instincts

510
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232
Terrible take the whole thing

511
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
You know he should

512
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
104

513
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
For this I'm going to be

514
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
A dirty assholes

515
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
Sure sure

516
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,872
To be a Slave

517
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Problem

518
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Carly Shay

519
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
2000 Troost

520
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,392
Jordan Lee truck supplies armaments to

521
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,976
For allied with ISIS

522
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Decision

523
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
You not

524
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Like the idea of pulling

525
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
Troops out

526
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
General

527
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
Yeah always I'm going to be in favor of us not having fruits

528
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,024
Power vac

529
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
That is going to lead to

530
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Possibly the genocide of the

531
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
Now that's never been tried before

532
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:19,200
By removing a large number of troops

533
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Really really quickly

534
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,296
That could create a power vacuum

535
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,904
Let's let's just take a random this could have occurred as a hypothetical

536
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
I was going to go 2011

537
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,656
Great job with the Kurds

538
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
Generally been a very strong allies

539
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
Was going to abandon the Kurds in Northern Syria Isis

540
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Killing at least one Kurdish fighter

541
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
The girls are part of the Syrian Democratic forces

542
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,136
Is it a lion

543
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
Who are supported by Saudi Arabia in

544
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Guitar

545
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
In terms of providing arms

546
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,304
Switched alliances

547
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Sporting

548
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Is patently absurd

549
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Because if they did

550
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Conflict or Italy

551
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
This barge aspect

552
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
It would be over

553
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
It wouldn't

554
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Exist

555
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Understand his take

556
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
At all

557
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
This whole

558
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,784
Syrian situation I wish I had

559
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Way more of a grasp on

560
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Evereve

561
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,232
Possible like Angela a bit but at the same time I recognized

562
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,608
Even don't understand

563
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
We shouldn't have troops there

564
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
It's an illegal

565
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Remove troops

566
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
From that place

567
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Like the argument

568
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Bring them there are really it's

569
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Between us and

570
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Time to stop

571
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Are we

572
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
I mean

573
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
I think that I think that at the end of the day

574
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
Some of those questions will be answered

575
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
We may not like to see

576
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,536
Right

577
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,400
Absolute Auto forces in play in

578
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
In terms of

579
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
The situation in Syria

580
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,336
I even Hazard to say whether I'm for or against

581
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
The idea of taking

582
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Exactly

583
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,016
I can see an argument for and I can also see strong argument

584
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
To not do it based on the consequences but you'll come

585
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
It's not a perfect thing

586
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,536
The idea that the Kurds are allies with ISIS

587
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
This is absolutely not

588
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Save the Trump kids

589
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,216
Honorable and Noble

590
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Occurred

591
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
It just leaves them sitting ducks

592
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,664
Are supported by Saudi Arabia Qatar Russia Assad

593
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
People who will

594
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Now that the u.s. is

595
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Will have no incense

596
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Not

597
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Make Massif

598
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
People buy

599
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Possibly

600
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,584
Really really awful it like

601
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
Him choosing serious Pacific

602
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Definitely has nothing

603
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Foreign powers that a maybe

604
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
I'm sure he's going to

605
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Troops out of

606
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,664
Stop providing

607
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,016
I assume we're going to get out of so many of that

608
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Military bases all around the world

609
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
To do what do

610
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Would be that I don't

611
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Specific reason

612
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Would be picked up

613
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Call Sprint

614
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
Because Alex is conversation

615
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,288
Idea of life

616
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,896
You know they're going to wrap that up real quick financing

617
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
Much like

618
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
The run-up to the

619
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
2016 election

620
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
The plan will kick in

621
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Into place

622
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,440
Once everything's settled

623
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,536
He's still using that narrative is being like that's what's right

624
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
In front of us

625
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,864
Assad is going to allow democracy

626
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Thrive Anna

627
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Alex

628
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
Your your argument survey ston

629
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
Pieczenik

630
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,360
And now you don't even like Steve

631
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
But you're still using his narrative

632
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
Like it that's so fascinating to be that Alex is like

633
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Steve pieczenik was trying to convince

634
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,624
Text me just say that the Las Vegas shooting

635
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
He was trying to get me to

636
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
Make that money

637
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
But I realize that's not

638
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Alex went on air inside the sea

639
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
Steve pieczenik is probably still running CIA psyop

640
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
But hasn't taken a second

641
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Consider what

642
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,056
Pieces of his worldview were brought to him by

643
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
A question though

644
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
The idea of these Secret counter-coup

645
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:10,528
Our military

646
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
Decide where they were going to

647
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,744
Everybody's going to be super in a hat

648
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Steve told him and he hasn't even

649
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Tiny little bit

650
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
3

651
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
If he's been lying to me and trying to get me to godown Road

652
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Me to go down

653
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
What about

654
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Because

655
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
Completely destroy his support for

656
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
See I have

657
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
No problem

658
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
Because if

659
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
One thing that I

660
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Really learned

661
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Never

662
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Underestimate

663
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Soleil

664
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Why would he go back

665
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,976
I can change

666
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,072
Mr. Fact check

667
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:59,424
But various reason behind it and that is

668
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
If that pee

669
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
Domino fall

670
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
It calls into question still money

671
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Nvidia ended up support

672
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,432
Like I don't think you probably would have ended up supporting Trump if you didn't have that

673
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Fictional

674
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
Mythology of being the mouth

675
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Piece of the secret

676
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,344
Goodguys in intelligence Council

677
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,976
Nonsense going on the TV

678
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
It's crazy

679
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
But if it comes down to it and there is

680
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
I don't know

681
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
When that's going to happen

682
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
I don't know what that was

683
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
Even look like

684
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,992
Doesn't step down and have elections Alex

685
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
We're going to come tonight because there'll never be a satisfactory piece to where he's like I'm now it's time

686
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Just stay on because

687
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Is a strong leader that needs

688
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
To be in there right now

689
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
In order to

690
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Right

691
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
So

692
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
I don't know it is all a lot of nonsense

693
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Spite

694
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
It's not nearly as much

695
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Nonsense

696
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
Saudi Arabia

697
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,392
Previously

698
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,400
He said if you do it we're going to overthrow you right now

699
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
Okay

700
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Bingo bingo

701
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
Respond to that

702
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
Is the worst person on Earth

703
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Because

704
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
Do you understand the argument that he's make

705
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Taking their base

706
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
The truck basically brought women driving and takeoff

707
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Between understanding the definitions of the word

708
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
Using and understanding the argument that

709
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,552
These words

710
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
It's not

711
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
What

712
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia on May 20th

713
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
21st 2017

714
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Here are just some of the things that have happened

715
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Narrative

716
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,960
In November 2018 a national released a report showing

717
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Saudi Arabia

718
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
Tortured sexually harassed and mistreated several Human Rights Act

719
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
Of this year

720
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
The activists were flawed intellect

721
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,272
Attributed leading one of them to attempt suicide

722
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Heatedly Wiley

723
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,416
Unmarked in March 2018 Saudi Arabia arrested a number of women's rights act

724
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,000
Some of them were leading campaigners for the right to drive for women

725
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,816
Including Lugene Al health

726
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Aziza al-yousef

727
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
Innocence quote as the Saudi Arabia Saudi Crown Prince

728
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Is the world

729
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,800
Presenting himself as a reformer he's arrested women's rights activists who were

730
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Refuse to accept

731
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Is tokenism

732
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Leaving it to us

733
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
To make their voices

734
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Kenneth Roth

735
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Executive director ratio

736
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
In August 28th

737
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Team Saudi Arabia sought the death

738
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
Rights activists

739
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Israel

740
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
And for social

741
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
The charges the accuser of included

742
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Participating in protests

743
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,144
Chanting slogans

744
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
Protest in public

745
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,496
Arrested in December

746
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
15 she was held without access

747
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
Text with lawyer for

748
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,175
Her most recent trial was scheduled for November 21st of this year but she wasn't brought to

749
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,247
The court which is also what happened in her October 28th

750
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
Which is lifesum international rights organizations

751
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
Do you mean that she's already dead

752
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
4

753
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Some sort of Terror

754
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
Yeah I don't want to present

755
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
Republic

756
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
It's one of the other

757
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
She's fine

758
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Barring any proof

759
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
That's about as best

760
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
It seems that way

761
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,431
August 18th the Canadian Ambassador was expelled from the country

762
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,527
Africana Discord Minister tweeted in support of releasing jail active

763
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,647
Then there was the October star related murder of journalist Jamal khashoggi the atrocities being

764
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Competitive

765
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
And the list goes on and on with

766
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,767
Instances of Saudi Arabia being squarely on the wrong side of

767
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Human rights issues

768
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
Long after Trump supposed

769
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
They gave him a Stern talk

770
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
Nothing that Alex is saying makes any sense

771
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Fictional reality to live in

772
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
To justify why he

773
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,687
Used to be critical of Saudi Arabia

774
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Play the good guy

775
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
Because Trump has said that there's a good guy

776
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
So that's all

777
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
He's just trying to shift his narrative

778
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
By creating

779
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Any false reality

780
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
True in the world is suffering

781
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
No

782
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,679
Most of the Republican party has abandoned every ideals they ever stood

783
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Good for in order to

784
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
Witches ride the wave of a massive racing

785
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
Alex is literally carrying water for p

786
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
People who are try it working

787
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Thought it was

788
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
Brilliant move to be like hey

789
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,791
I will give all of you the right to drive

790
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Steve activist

791
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:51,423
Hempstead and secretly I will kill all of these activists so I never have to worry about active

792
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
Again and I'll never have to

793
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
To change anything

794
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Because that's the

795
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
The name of a

796
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Textbook

797
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Accompany

798
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Columbia Missouri

799
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Kush gig that I could have gotten when I was

800
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,927
If I could have gotten in there but the drug test

801
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,999
Fireman

802
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
I have taken the stuff

803
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,887
You know that's what's supposed to flush out your system

804
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
Never when I got my drug test results back

805
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Tested positive

806
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
For a number of steps

807
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Richards

808
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Little bit

809
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Anyway just memories flood back

810
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
I got you

811
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,527
Could have been

812
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,927
Clearly paddling a self-deluded narrative

813
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
About Trump and his actions

814
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Visa vie

815
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
The Kurds and Saudi Arabia

816
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
But

817
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
They are like the war party house

818
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
Liberal

819
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,551
He's a liberator really appreciate

820
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
Probably not

821
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
Trump is the great Liberator and all of you

822
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
You liberals have been caught

823
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
I don't know

824
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
How how can you

825
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
Just like how

826
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,703
I just I just don't understand

827
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:34,079
This is a real psychotic episode

828
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Same time

829
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,431
Nothing makes any f****** sense

830
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,735
None of what they're saying makes sense

831
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,855
Like I don't I just want to have a conversation that makes sense instead of a conversation where it's like

832
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,463
I'm actually president Alice from wonderland

833
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,535
She does it's fantastic and how dare you you evil suck

834
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,351
King rabbit what are you doing

835
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
No I just think we shouldn't lower

836
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
For the rich I don't know what to

837
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,895
I want to see an Alice in Wonderland with Alex

838
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Whose voice I think a lot of this might

839
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
Come down to to the

840
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
The stuff that we spoke

841
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,599
I think that perception might be in your head because of

842
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
So much

843
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
To the covering the proper

844
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Even though it is

845
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,327
I think that we have a little bit of

846
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Because

847
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Weezer so much Alex

848
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,495
No that's that's reasonable but it's the only other exclamation

849
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Is that

850
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,567
So much of the Republican party is

851
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
Either apathetic

852
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,455
To reading any news whatsoever which now that I say that

853
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
Nope

854
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,623
Saudi Arabia

855
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
I suppose that is a question that between two options

856
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,351
The first nevermind you're correct

857
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,911
Chicago and who started a question

858
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
Boo today

859
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:15,199
Like I I legitimately

860
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
Perpetuating putting out into the world

861
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
On Christmas Eve

862
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,111
This is Christmas Eve

863
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
I think it's very dangerous

864
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Really bad

865
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,999
I think his behavior is

866
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
I think there's a moral character

867
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Sometimes I don't

868
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
I don't really care too much

869
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
Good moral discussion about like him lying about

870
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Miac report

871
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,871
I'm not super interested

872
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,199
Morality of life

873
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
That like

874
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
That compelling abaca

875
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
Conversation

876
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Do you say

877
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
Or at very least

878
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
Normalizing

879
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Covering up

880
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,535
And I pray that is really bad I think that's actually

881
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
I think that's

882
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
Evil and that makes it all the funnier

883
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
Alex talks about how he

884
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Incapable of Eve

885
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Treacherous but

886
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,687
Myself

887
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
I just can't do it

888
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,319
Stone

889
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Shooting

890
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
That's pathologic

891
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
Ovulation and I don't even know who they are

892
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,703
You don't even know

893
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,751
If you saw it it's like

894
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Can't do it

895
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
The problem is

896
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,951
Literally

897
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,239
I'm starting a name out loud

898
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,823
I think he's actually being Blasphemous right now show loyal

899
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
That makes sense

900
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Not at all

901
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
No

902
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,807
Quantify

903
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,071
2020 all I can say is this

904
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,687
This whole thing this is all about

905
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,599
Alex's apologizing forever support

906
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
I can't

907
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
I can't do anymore at least not like

908
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
Play manager

909
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,727
Forever instrumental part in

910
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
Did the guy who ran

911
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,847
Other propaganda Outlet

912
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,431
To the point of getting me sued by hoppy Lucaya

913
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
TV Guide

914
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:33,599
Now is working to help Jer bolsonaro the guy is Brazil's Trump

915
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
Well we would say

916
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,023
Authoritarian rise around the world that Alex called

917
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,119
The Nationalist movement around the world

918
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,519
Steven has a huge pardon are they what the f*** are you doing Alex analyzed for a second

919
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
It's amazing

920
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
It's crazy

921
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
Dumb dumb

922
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
We even consider saying like

923
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
I couldn't

924
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
Dewey Villages are capable of

925
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
Debt relief

926
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,671
Like that is a malignant narcissistic trait

927
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
Like I can do no wrong

928
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
Of course I do

929
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
Minimized

930
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,911
But I

931
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Putik aspect

932
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Do that

933
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
Oftentimes when

934
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
You suffer from like

935
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,335
Guilt and shame

936
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
Accessories in your life and

937
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
Is there is a helpful

938
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,759
Little trick

939
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Then

940
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Not even

941
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Not even like

942
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Morally

943
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Your bed

944
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,655
If only because he went to a movie and you got a hot dog

945
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Why is it

946
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,799
Why isn't there so many weird

947
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Evil Republic

948
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
You mean

949
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Ketchup

950
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
So I don't know that that's

951
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Apologizing

952
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
For its supporting Steve

953
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
Everything about him supports

954
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,487
Brother stuff

955
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,727
Capable of evil

956
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,895
I don't know if you play sports growing up

957
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
When you are younger they gave you instead

958
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Duration

959
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Coaches the gave you

960
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Inspirational

961
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,023
I was out

962
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,167
What's that quote

963
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
My sophomore year set all kinds of inspiration

964
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Remember any of it

965
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,223
Just kidding. Probably right

966
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Time to lean time

967
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,063
Between

968
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
My response.

969
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
X

970
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,303
Give me to go the f*** home

971
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
And I like that kind of effort overcomes probably recognize

972
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
Almost everything

973
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
Is just something

974
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,175
From expressional poster

975
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:43,807
It's not some sort of hang in there

976
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Looks like released

977
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:51,487
Every coach says the exact same thing

978
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
List of cliches

979
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
Cliche that the coach told him is some sort of

980
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Profound advice

981
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
Trump is very fatalistic he believes he goes into this

982
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,799
Football coach

983
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,127
Poison your father

984
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,463
Well well well well well well well well well we got it we got it

985
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,023
You got put up to varsity because

986
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,863
You hurt people and they like that

987
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Great

988
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,447
Even so like

989
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
You're not supposed

990
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,479
Play football on Safeway very hard not to

991
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,807
That's a psychotic impulse

992
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
Yeah because people pads and all that

993
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:59,583
The people who play like high school football

994
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,679
That's someone who also may or may not have killed a couple dogs in their life

995
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
That is a lunatic

996
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,871
Coach told me he said 100% you don't get hard

997
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:24,927
Is going a hundred percent

998
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
When you get hurt is like one

999
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
Most Bush League

1000
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
Actually play sports

1001
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,935
Because you would know that

1002
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:42,591
You know how most of the NFL goes half-speed all the time that's how they became the the professional sports player

1003
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
That's why I like there's a toy

1004
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
25%

1005
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,759
Totally

1006
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,599
Go hundred percent

1007
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Stop it

1008
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
Because he believes in you

1009
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
He's ready to die

1010
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Punjabi shopping called a chain

1011
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:14,079
Call the brat shut down

1012
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:20,479
Michelle out

1013
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
So get ready for fireworks

1014
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:31,487
There's no pedophile card in the Tarot deck

1015
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,071
Used for playing War

1016
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:41,471
I'm not totally sure why are tarot cards something specific

1017
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
It's only his Christmas Eve episode perfect

1018
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,271
Perfect time for him to ramble about his Heroes

1019
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,111
Top of the esoteric magic devil card game deck

1020
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
The problem is

1021
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951
The Tarot deck doesn't operate the same way

1022
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:06,047
Cards does where the highest card is the better it is

1023
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,447
Also in normal decks

1024
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,775
The Tarot deck

1025
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,079
Want pickles or coins

1026
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
And swords

1027
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Each represent more or less

1028
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
A different one of the elements

1029
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,479
That's generally how both

1030
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
People look at the Tara

1031
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
And the King of Thieves

1032
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Denotes

1033
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Completely

1034
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,487
Also Kincardine draw needs a completely different thing depending on where the card is drawn in a reading

1035
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,071
And if it's drawn up right or reverse there's a lot of variables

1036
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
It's twins right

1037
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,359
There is there's

1038
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:59,551
The four suits are each a minor Arcana because

1039
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,343
Each suit

1040
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,159
Is Alex wanted to really make

1041
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
The emperor the emperor represents a powerful leader

1042
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:21,311
Respecting Authority as a leader you rule the firm but fair hand give a Clear Vision of what you want to create

1043
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,359
Did you organize those around you to manifest

1044
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
You listened to the advice of others

1045
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,943
So you prefer to have the final say

1046
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,503
Conflict doesn't scare you and you wouldn't hesitate

1047
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Use your power to

1048
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Protect those you care about

1049
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,135
That could have been a fun way for Alex to describe Trump

1050
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Those those Center

1051
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,463
And says remind me of this

1052
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
That people used

1053
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,535
The scam it's called

1054
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
You know

1055
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
Where it could describe literally f****** everybody

1056
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
There is a touch of that

1057
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,983
I don't want to go too far into like

1058
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,591
That's all I'm saying

1059
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,855
No hero Magic the Gathering

1060
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:11,487
Almost never knows what he's talkin about particularly

1061
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
Accidentally

1062
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
Into the worlds of these supposedly

1063
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
Evil things

1064
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Again

1065
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
King of cups

1066
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,495
It was like wipeout

1067
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,519
So

1068
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,871
You got very excited

1069
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
I forgot this coat was coming because

1070
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,015
Kind of

1071
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,599
I thought that was what we were working towards

1072
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,391
I forgot about this clip

1073
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,975
Alex should never have said this on air

1074
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,559
This is really really f***** up

1075
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,375
I mean there is Larry Nichols

1076
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,215
Blackmail Congress

1077
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
Everything song

1078
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:01,407
Alex shouldn't have talked about being debriefed by Russian intelligence agent said that on air

1079
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,967
Killing his dog

1080
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
Salon

1081
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,599
This one I think might have legal implication

1082
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,463
He's having Rodger Stone on the other end of the phone

1083
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
And they're talking about how

1084
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
All this Russian stuff is b*******

1085
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,095
And Alex accidentally

1086
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,655
Tell some backstage business

1087
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,263
Alex is reviewing something really really shouldn't

1088
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
I was there

1089
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
Fox News contributors

1090
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,879
So first things first Alex Rodgers business into the streets

1091
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,975
During the campaign he was a paid contributor in Fox News

1092
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,303
That's whatever

1093
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
Because of the time

1094
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
After

1095
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
November 2015

1096
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,263
That's the first time that Rodger fearon Alex

1097
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
Alexa

1098
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
I have to be in that timeframe

1099
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
Rodger was fired

1100
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
From Fox News

1101
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
He comes to Al

1102
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,111
I wish you would hire me for your good call Michelle

1103
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
So

1104
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,951
Rodger has come to Alex

1105
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,255
You've asked him for a job at Infowars

1106
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
Importantly he said he

1107
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
Did not read

1108
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Facebook was making

1109
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
The president's 20lb J Killing Kennedy

1110
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,103
In 2016

1111
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Epsom

1112
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,943
Rodger

1113
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
Communications Network

1114
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Call The Stone Cold Truth

1115
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
He was very short-lived

1116
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
So that probably is right around

1117
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
We're talkin about

1118
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,671
He asked Alex for a job he got him a show on

1119
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
Gcn

1120
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,351
Massage

1121
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,823
Amazon

1122
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,687
I'll try I do this talk show host

1123
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,783
Alex Jones has now just admitted on air

1124
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,087
Veggie Direction Rochester

1125
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,607
You going to try and portray that as like

1126
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:33,471
It's no big deal Rodger was unsuccessful in getting in touch with him meanwhile

1127
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
If it does turn out that there is concrete evidence that Rodger was in contact with them

1128
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,455
Switch

1129
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
I think they're strong indication

1130
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
That he was

1131
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,063
Put the actual evidence

1132
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,135
We'll see if it is which

1133
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
But if it is

1134
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,511
Alex has just put himself in prison

1135
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:02,911
Self first time I've ever been

1136
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:08,031
All around the world

1137
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:14,687
During the campaign Rodger Stone got fired as a contributor by Fox News

1138
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:22,367
If you bring me the most illegal bring

1139
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,023
Alex Jones

1140
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,095
Direct you to commit a crime

1141
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
For the Christmas gift to

1142
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
What happened

1143
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
Remember

1144
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Sure

1145
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:10,239
Starting attending that clip with I was there not going to play out well for you Alex

1146
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Here's what I also

1147
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,799
I didn't just

1148
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
I need to make sure that you know

1149
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
I was there when the crime was also committed

1150
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
Condition of getting a job

1151
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
With me

1152
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
Which if that's the

1153
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,879
Give Rodger a job

1154
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,487
If you can get me in touch with that Julian Assange

1155
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279
I will give you a job

1156
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Logically that I mean

1157
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,607
He did get a job

1158
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
Did he come through now this is a whole new indentation

1159
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,567
I'm sure whatever the reality of the situation

1160
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
With any kind of like

1161
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,503
Subpoena power and stuff like that they already

1162
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
It's no secret

1163
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
Official Channel

1164
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
But it's really funny

1165
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,951
On Christmas Eve with Alex Jones in studio

1166
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,791
Tried to get really defensive

1167
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,607
To contact Julian Assange dead Rodger Stone

1168
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,423
Clearly was telling him that he did contact

1169
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:16,287
I mean remember that one episode

1170
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
Alex stayed up super late in order to cover the WikiLeaks

1171
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
Bibigo dumplings

1172
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Either Galaxy

1173
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
This shows like

1174
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,439
I get why you use fake quotes

1175
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,487
Cuz you are

1176
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:43,423
Propaganda

1177
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
And everybody else who works behind the scenes it

1178
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,239
Infowars must be

1179
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Do so much

1180
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,847
Toomics like to keep this on track

1181
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
Do s*** like that

1182
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,687
Alex

1183
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
Don't say s*** about

1184
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:01,343
Can I get contacts

1185
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,231
I directed

1186
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
Oh I shouldn't have said that

1187
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,935
Was 100%

1188
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:22,335
I would have loved it if children I would love it if there was like you were watching it

1189
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,639
It was just sort of like everything's going normally on the shown

1190
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,199
No

1191
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,247
You came to me told me he got fired by Fox News

1192
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:35,135
But if you get me Julian Assange I'll give you a job and then just all of a sudden

1193
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:41,535
Let's go out to the technical difficulties

1194
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,863
I forgot to the lobby

1195
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:54,591
Gorgeous everybody divers over each other to hit that button

1196
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
Holyshit

1197
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:07,135
It's almost it's almost looks like Saved by the Bell just break the fourth wall in book

1198
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
And be like

1199
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,303
By the way I can turn back the Rock

1200
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
What's Rodger Kmart

1201
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Miniature dachshund

1202
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
Anything yet

1203
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,215
How to spell expecting Rogers be like

1204
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Alex

1205
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:31,199
She is just like

1206
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,807
You like I have always told the truth and I told the

1207
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:40,927
The house intelligence committee

1208
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,999
Probably like

1209
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,559
A deal put together where

1210
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Alex

1211
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,143
Donates $100,000 to his legal defense fund

1212
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Every time he runs

1213
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Legal defense

1214
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,007
Ever every time he goes dirty laundry

1215
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
So they don't talk

1216
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,455
Much more about this but they do spend a little time talking about that

1217
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
The Criminal Justice Reform

1218
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
And how

1219
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,671
Let's talk about that

1220
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,679
It's really extraordinary in Alaska

1221
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
Withdrawing

1222
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,415
In the ward legalizing marijuana

1223
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:54,655
He's a Republican president with a republican Congress

1224
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,703
He talks about marijuana reform

1225
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,751
I imagine that everybody in the Republican

1226
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,079
Control Congress again it is a 100% Republic

1227
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,359
Can control Congress

1228
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:09,759
And a Republican president and a republican Supreme Court

1229
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
Literally any Trump trump

1230
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,367
Says start talking about legalized

1231
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,183
He starts talking about medical marijuana and just from this

1232
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
Score from the Sun

1233
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
You just hear sound

1234
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:29,471
You see f****** Paul Ryan and Rand Paul put on like a Rastafarian

1235
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:37,151
Criminal justice system

1236
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
That is not

1237
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,487
True

1238
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
What does a

1239
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,071
Go far enough but yeah I would work

1240
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
Another pretty cool

1241
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
Because one of the first

1242
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
Is Bugatti

1243
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
Did you sort of an extension

1244
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,031
Things from the Obama era that are

1245
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
I already made

1246
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Which is good I'm at

1247
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
Like the Democrats

1248
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
Justice Reform

1249
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
Because Trump is

1250
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
In favor of it

1251
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
A sort of

1252
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,183
Credibility

1253
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,023
The largest voices and slide opposition were Kamala Harris who said that

1254
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,815
You didn't think the reforms went far enough

1255
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,887
But also didn't want your idealism allow quote

1256
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,983
Perfect to be the enemy of Good Witch is

1257
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,383
A good way to look at Elizabeth Warren

1258
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Because she also did

1259
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Didn't feel like it

1260
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Against the billets

1261
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
There's more we

1262
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,111
Literally all 12 navo to the Senate were Republican

1263
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,439
The same is true of everyone is a 36-in

1264
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
Not a single Democrat voted

1265
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,447
48

1266
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,519
So where is your argument there your argument is not

1267
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
Liberals are against this

1268
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Because Trump is for it

1269
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
It doesn't hold water this

1270
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Nonsense

1271
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
I bet there's

1272
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
There's no way you could

1273
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
Marco Rubio

1274
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,023
All that is just nonsense Rogerson

1275
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
John Stockton

1276
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
But

1277
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,607
He's not the only one

1278
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Dislike sklep Alex

1279
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Might have started

1280
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Christmas

1281
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:50,271
Nog because he's sort of burping his way to the dead pivot

1282
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,367
We're going to broadcast

1283
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
Trump's mind why he's doing this

1284
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,999
Why you standing up

1285
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,279
Are going to strike

1286
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,839
Back Trump if you want prosperity

1287
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
The Establishment denture a bunch of idiots

1288
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
Shredded Robstown please don't forget free shipping

1289
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:23,039
Free t-shirt

1290
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,879
The sales have been going so well

1291
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:31,487
That they are adequate

1292
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,511
Is not good

1293
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,583
I'm going to suggest the ark

1294
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,399
He was drunk when you put Rodger

1295
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
I have no idea

1296
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,495
But I'm certain he started

1297
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
And it's not just that

1298
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,567
The barfi

1299
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
There which is

1300
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,895
Glaring

1301
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
He was saying

1302
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:00,927
Pretty gross stuff

1303
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
Especially for Christmas

1304
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,231
We were talking about

1305
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
The globalist

1306
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,607
Got

1307
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
He's strangling

1308
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,703
It's a manly thing to strangle

1309
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
You decide

1310
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,247
He's not thrilled

1311
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Obvious performance

1312
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
First murder rap

1313
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
He's got to

1314
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
Get into another one

1315
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,415
He's going to do it to be sweet

1316
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:53,407
American Tire Biola

1317
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:59,807
Replicate they sell K2

1318
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:08,511
And you don't feel much like right

1319
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,375
And the meek shall inherit the earth

1320
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,775
Start biking

1321
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
Trailer given shelter in the manger

1322
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:30,783
Powerful stuff

1323
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,207
At the office whenever you want

1324
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:44,607
Look up usually likes

1325
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
Constrictors

1326
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:54,591
Please

1327
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
Make it look organic

1328
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:02,527
Because the radio station won't he worth it

1329
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
Get back

1330
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
F*** is this

1331
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,903
F****** done sensical murder rant that leads into

1332
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Him singing one line Rodger to bring it when they come back

1333
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,399
So f****** weird again

1334
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
Can't stress this enough

1335
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,751
This is Christmas

1336
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,871
Secret system holidays for Alex Jones

1337
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,039
I'm going to compare myself

1338
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
The very thing that state

1339
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
In my

1340
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,511
Breaking Rodger Stone

1341
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
He really brought it in

1342
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,095
725

1343
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
He brought in the way I wanted

1344
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
He makes

1345
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
But you've never lied

1346
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
Intentionally

1347
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
He has never

1348
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,639
Like because you know that whole Lee after his Apollo

1349
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:06,527
Miles Kwok

1350
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:12,927
Batman had 200 million

1351
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,767
I would like 100 million.

1352
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
But it was Sam number salt

1353
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,375
So OK Google

1354
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,703
Yeah he's now gotten into

1355
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
Damage control mode

1356
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
The apology which is

1357
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:33,919
Which is meid number told me bad things

1358
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
Right

1359
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,015
Knowingly lie

1360
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,599
Is the Disco to the minute-long

1361
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
And within minutes

1362
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Rodger Stone will say that

1363
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,975
Never knowingly lied about anything

1364
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,023
And then proceeded to lie

1365
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,327
Seconds later about Alex.

1366
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:55,935
Squeaky sword incredible smear

1367
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
I reported

1368
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,743
General McMaster

1369
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Trump

1370
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:27,167
Diet Cokes with a slow-acting sedative narcotic

1371
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,007
The timer

1372
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,463
Rodger Stone

1373
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,359
Tomorrow's weather

1374
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,967
Flight

1375
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,559
Just continue to recycle the same

1376
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
So it

1377
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
You say that

1378
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:33,727
He has never reported things that are he knows are not true

1379
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,543
15 seconds later he says that Alex

1380
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
Never said that no one died it's

1381
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Bad news

1382
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
You know that

1383
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
Because if I worked for Alex Jones

1384
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Let's say I didn't know

1385
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,063
Right

1386
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Back at the time

1387
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
The accusation that he

1388
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,767
Send it no one died and argued that quite a bit on his show

1389
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
I would probably go and check

1390
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,423
I would look into it I would want to know the truth because if the person I was working

1391
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
2/14

1392
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
I wouldn't want to work for it

1393
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,335
I would want to be able to point

1394
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
The things that you

1395
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
Be able to defend my employer

1396
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,455
Who was a noble and righteous person

1397
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,527
There's no way that I would just go

1398
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,575
Snow White

1399
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
So the idea that Rodger

1400
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,975
I could have plausible deniability that I don't know if it's true

1401
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
True or not

1402
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,815
He's not saying that he's never said

1403
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,655
Did they are going to hire the

1404
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
Disgraced reporter from

1405
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:39,263
Almost

1406
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,079
I never know

1407
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
We made up those

1408
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,663
I didn't I didn't even cut that stuff

1409
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:48,991
Quite a bit

1410
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,271
Because they were saying

1411
01:19:54,623 --> 01:20:00,767
Turn off I apologize 104

1412
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
Like he was Bass

1413
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:08,703
The only writing fake stories about how white people in

1414
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
He was trying to

1415
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:19,968
Award-winning journalist for German newspaper Der Spiegel was only writing about Texans

1416
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,504
Alex is trying to

1417
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,064
To create the perception that the lies and be fake stories

1418
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
Is that he

1419
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
You wrote about

1420
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
Trying to

1421
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,928
Summit Racing

1422
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Sabbatical

1423
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
But not as much

1424
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,608
Stretches the next clip

1425
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,240
Russian Mastermind

1426
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
Do notice though to it isn't

1427
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
He's breathing a lot

1428
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,624
The supposed Russian Mastermind

1429
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,744
Hillary the Russians

1430
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,944
Economy over

1431
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,624
Sao Paulo

1432
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,672
Movie agent in the United States

1433
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,512
Former director of the FBI

1434
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,816
And then became an FBI

1435
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,424
If you are Kremlin agent the whole time

1436
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,728
You are the top page

1437
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
I'm not going to let it

1438
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,480
Uranium

1439
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,344
I just

1440
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,904
I get the sense as I was as a listener

1441
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
Haven't watched

1442
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,536
Listening to it as

1443
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:14,400
The radio yeah yeah

1444
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
I got to see this

1445
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:20,544
Theater of the mind will not actually doing things

1446
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,128
But

1447
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
I was watching

1448
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,176
I really get

1449
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,504
She wasn't drunk when he started the show and

1450
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
He's drunk by the

1451
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,832
You started taking some shots

1452
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,112
Or something like that

1453
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
I'm not sure it which

1454
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
Hard to nail down

1455
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,280
But he is he is not the same level of sober

1456
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,048
Becky

1457
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,864
It's not consistent everybody enjoy

1458
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Is an ice Chris

1459
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Everybody

1460
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
Enjoy the nice little Tipple on the Christmas Eve

1461
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,080
You know your 14 and your parents are like hey

1462
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
Guess what

1463
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,640
We're all going to enjoy this

1464
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Nice little Brandy

1465
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,784
Gather

1466
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
I want to make it clear I'm not judge

1467
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:10,464
Puritan new saying don't drink but I haven't

1468
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,608
I'm not even on that since I used to work at Groupon it was nothing but booze

1469
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,776
You know I get it people are adults

1470
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
No big deal

1471
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,848
I do think you're in a position where you're

1472
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,384
Putting out dangerous rhetoric

1473
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Came to the world

1474
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:31,200
About matter

1475
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
You probably should

1476
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,784
If you're drunk you better be right

1477
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,600
You better have your like all of your ducks in a row

1478
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,648
If you're going to be wrong and

1479
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,000
That sort of fun fun like yeah

1480
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,280
That just doesn't work

1481
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,840
When you're carrying water for

1482
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
The deaths of people

1483
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,960
Around the world and you're like slipping

1484
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
Drunk and fun at work

1485
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
It's not

1486
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Because

1487
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:07,296
It's clear really shouldn't have been a conversation we needed to have

1488
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
Yam

1489
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Chaka Khan

1490
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,976
I am assuming that he is going to talk about the massive

1491
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,864
Drop and how it was one of the worst days since the Great Depression

1492
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
And the people don't get this

1493
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:32,128
There's nothing they won't

1494
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,736
Drudgereport.com

1495
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Despite

1496
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,024
Buster's

1497
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:54,400
Moonshine really think if

1498
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,240
You were in love with Donald Trump you would know how to say Steve minucci

1499
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,568
You would mention

1500
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,384
Crescent Moon

1501
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,456
You think you know the guy

1502
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,552
Maybe it reminds me of how they couldn't pronounce

1503
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,344
Tim Geithner

1504
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
If you only seen this in print

1505
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:23,328
Is this a new name

1506
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,032
Stop it out

1507
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:37,408
Isaac Eric Buckley write his script but it's all just like

1508
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
This is not

1509
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
But

1510
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,688
They say that

1511
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,952
People doing things I didn't do and the stock market

1512
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
Boy back up

1513
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,864
All he's doing is being opportunist

1514
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,448
Think about the circumstances that are in front of him

1515
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Not taking it

1516
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
Consideration

1517
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
What happens tomorrow

1518
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,104
A piece of the story that you're unaware of what happened yesterday

1519
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:45,504
I'm kind of still fascinated I'm still fascinated whenever like

1520
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,040
We do have those

1521
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,344
Market update on

1522
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,928
Regular news outlets

1523
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
The stock market update

1524
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,256
Doesn't really affect anything

1525
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:07,520
Massively artificial intelligence

1526
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
Like nobody knows what the f*** is going on

1527
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,688
Those news shows even though like local news that happened

1528
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,736
To fill an hour everyday like

1529
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,528
You still have time you got a felony

1530
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
You're just.

1531
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,416
Sinclair are so Insidious

1532
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
Problem

1533
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,048
Which is feeling that

1534
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,096
Whoever's watching

1535
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Doesn't

1536
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Necessarily

1537
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
Santa Cruz weather

1538
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,984
Most weather reports are unnecessary

1539
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
Come on

1540
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:45,664
How dare you on fire

1541
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,688
I don't give a s***

1542
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Skillet

1543
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,808
You don't have any

1544
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,856
I have a deep-seated distrust

1545
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
The weathermen

1546
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,672
I really think I think

1547
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,000
They are perverts

1548
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Well

1549
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,888
Meteorology

1550
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,728
People get into study

1551
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,872
It's not something puns

1552
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
The people study

1553
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,736
A subset of the people who study who are also camera-ready

1554
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,272
Is a very small

1555
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,600
These people who are charismatic enough

1556
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,624
And actually keep

1557
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,976
And the weather in Knoxville like

1558
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,512
Complete idiots reading the script

1559
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,816
Those are two people know that their jobs are

1560
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,888
So f****** protected when they go to cities like

1561
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,424
Chicago la

1562
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,216
New York those are things

1563
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:45,824
Become institutions on the news

1564
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,384
Specific about him at all

1565
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,784
I think those people like him so much as he's just

1566
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,832
Okay now I got it they know that they have

1567
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,392
Security

1568
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:04,000
Criminally pervert infection

1569
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,960
Absolutely absolutely

1570
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Women

1571
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,552
That we demand that our weathermen

1572
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,344
Affair

1573
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
Cell theory

1574
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
I agree

1575
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Stock stuff

1576
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,560
Point take

1577
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,144
Before everything

1578
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,680
Completely wrong

1579
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,216
And this clip I'm only playing because

1580
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
Cuz I think it is super important

1581
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,520
And that is

1582
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,824
So from time to time

1583
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,872
With the idea of what

1584
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,664
Because Alex is

1585
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,224
Is copyrighted

1586
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,760
And they're easily castlight

1587
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,808
Fear in my mind that one day he'll just

1588
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
Decide

1589
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:04,672
It was for copyright infringe

1590
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,464
Can what we do falls under fair use

1591
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,512
Rules

1592
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
I never want to deal with

1593
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,352
Like I never one I never want to open that

1594
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
Open court

1595
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,032
Appointments nightclub because

1596
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
It's Alex giving us permission

1597
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,736
On the record

1598
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
Just get the information out

1599
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,120
We're doing our best Alex

1600
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
Thanks buddy

1601
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:54,848
Can we ask you for other favors like could you please do it so we can just play that clip in

1602
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,432
I would love that I just want to get sued

1603
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:04,832
Using Digital Millennium rolls take you down was it play that clinic

1604
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,208
Judgment in favor of knowledge.

1605
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,000
So like I said

1606
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
Everything goes off

1607
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,328
Because Alex has been having some

1608
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,864
Also

1609
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
He's got

1610
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
Not much

1611
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:28,128
Yeah maybe I mean he mentions that he's not going to have his are you going to have a rebroadcast

1612
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
Christmas

Christmas Story What Christmas Means A Christmas message of love

1614
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,136

1615
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Which is his version

1616
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,304
Start with the Tarot deck

1617
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,632
There are a couple times that I

1618
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,912
I just didn't

1619
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:55,008
Excessive and repetitive

1620
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,288
Christmas at all

1621
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,896
Is it until Christmas are

1622
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,992
You know we're not going to be able to get you the products by Christmas but

1623
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Ray Ferraro

1624
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,600
That's what you think there is very little Christmas end

1625
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,648
But one gift

1626
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,416
Could you give some Eric

1627
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,208
Is that Benjamin

1628
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976

01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
He's doing great

1633
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,552
Worried about

1634
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,880
Google the rails in the third hour

1635
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
He has a

01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:48,000
Guest on the show it's actually two

1637
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,584
If these people don't belong on air at all

1638
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,400
All they have done

1639
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
I can't remember their name

1640
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,704
But it sounds something like

1641
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Spaghetti Brothers

1642
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
I don't know

1643
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,944
They created a flash game

1644
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
So

1645
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,832
It's a flash game that created Flash game

1646
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,136
Google

1647
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,416
Alex versus the end

1648
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,184
PCS

1649
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952

1650
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:26,912

There'll be like a clip of lest

1655
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920

01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,712
TV saying something

1657
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,248
Speaking of Alex

1658
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,856
You have to hit the button at the right time and it's them with an axe

1659
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,184
The flight of Air Force One

1660
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,720
All of them

1661
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
On the way

1662
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,512
Call

1663
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,048

1665
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,680
Very f*****-up

1666
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,544
Hour-and-a-half baby I would say an hour and a half

1667
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,616
Yeah because the game is about Alex

1668
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
Heater

1669
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,456
And he thinks it's the best thing in

1670
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:29,888
We can search the name of Arkansas

1671
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:36,544
I love Trump

1672
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
Amazon that's great

1673
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Reminds me of

01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,176
Mario

1675
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504

Beef Anto

1677
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:56,512
Like the actual assignment

1678
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,144
Evil Sonic Mario

1679
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
Yeah

1680
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,288
Video game

1681
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,592
Which video game

1682
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Complicity

1683
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,152
This game

1684
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,968
It's Alex Jones killing people with an axe

1685
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
You taking down these empty

1686
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
Subway

1687
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,904
The world from

1688
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,952
Are you trying to kill one of them

1689
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,768
A new logo will pop up on the side of the screen

1690
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,704
Pinterest

1691
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,896
Absolutely what was the last time you saw a pin on Pinterest of Alex Jones

1692
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Apple pie

1693
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
That would be nice

1694
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:50,528
I wouldn't eat a tide pod

1695
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,344
My very Drunk Kitchen

1696
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:01,280
British Bake Off mixer

1697
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,912
Because

1698
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,960
The video game involves him killing

1699
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
People with an ax

1700
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,288
He finds a knack

1701
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,872
This leads

1702
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
2

1703
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,200
Trouble

1704
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:24,320
12 year old and have him kill a piggy bank again

1705
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,160
Adult

1706
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,464
You know what there were similarities

1707
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
Because he was trying to

1708
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Impress

1709
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,264
Is NPC

1710
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Going to go away

1711
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,312
But these guys have

1712
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,104
Make a fun game out of it

1713
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,896
Buc-ee's

1714
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,176
So he pulls out his

1715
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:53,248
I believe it's a baby a Happy

1716
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,808
This is why I had to go find the video

1717
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,856
Because if you listen to this clip

1718
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,904
I don't think you'll believe that

1719
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,976
It accurately describes what is going on in studio

1720
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:11,680
There's no one in the studio right now

1721
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,288
Camerafi

1722
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,080
About 30 feet away

1723
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,408
My question is

1724
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:30,368
This is going to mess up I don't want to mess up everything

1725
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,184
Christmas Eve

1726
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,728
You are

1727
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:53,920
He's in the middle of his show

1728
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,504
In my professional TV studio

1729
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,552
With a f****** Hatchet

1730
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:09,280
Very expensive camera

1731
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,816
Money

1732
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:17,216
I am going to throw this Hatchet in a metaphor for how I feel about my own show at this I wish to destroy

1733
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:21,312
Troy the things that allow me to go deeper into this world that I am in

1734
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,360
It's

1735
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,688
Beasley bucked up

1736
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,968
I feel like there is a bit of

1737
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,344
Christmas Eve

1738
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,648
Can you say that out loud

1739
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:41,024
Christmas electronics

1740
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
I thought

1741
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,120
First of all

1742
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,936
What the f*** is going on

1743
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,472
It's so out of line with

1744
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
Not only his

1745
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,032
Most of

1746
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,848
The time

1747
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,688
He's gotta just be f****** around with these guys or something

1748
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,248
He straight-up throwing hatchets around

1749
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
It's a real Hatchet

1750
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,600
It's a pretty big Hatchet

1751
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,160
Why does he have a cigarette

1752
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,744
I'm going to allow it because like

1753
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,536
Somewhere

1754
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,864
Multiple hatch

1755
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,168
It's not the same Hatchet

1756
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,616
He had a bunch of hatch

1757
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,920
Should like

1758
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
You have a bunch of guns

1759
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,296
1 Hatcher

1760
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:39,904
And this is actually kind of internet video f***** me up to guns one Hatchet

1761
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,720
Did you see that one disposal might be Alex's soft launch into

1762
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
You trying to

1763
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,512
The Juggalos

1764
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,536
Used to like him

1765
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:49,120
Not like you Alec

1766
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
So when I was watching

1767
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,448
Completely blown away

1768
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,240
What's happening

1769
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
And then

1770
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,312
Thought when you said

1771
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,104
I get another try

1772
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,408
I think that someone in studio

1773
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,456
You've had enough

1774
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Calm down

1775
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
Not go that way

1776
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:19,072
Alex

1777
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
Real quick

1778
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,032
Audio of

1779
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
The game

1780
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,640
It has bat

1781
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,432
Pictures of the

1782
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
Video of the game

1783
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:39,808
Wow or whatever it's for him

1784
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
He's probably take

1785
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,624
Another drink while the cameras

1786
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:07,968
Again

1787
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,040
Time's the charm right now

1788
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:20,256
We're doing good

1789
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:50,208
The third throw hit the wall

1790
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Where is it

1791
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,280
It was literally like

1792
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,584
6in from a fire extinguisher

1793
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,056
This is crazy levels of irresponsible

1794
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,896
I think that there's something if this is like

1795
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:13,504
I don't know it's some sort of shock jock show

1796
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,904
This is a major drunkenly throwing a hatchet

1797
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Different context

1798
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
I'd be all for it

1799
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,632
What act

1800
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
Ditches

1801
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
Broke my heart

1802
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,240
Because God dammit

1803
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,848
In history would be the headline

1804
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,152
Alex Jones throws Hatchet

1805
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
Blows up his own Studio

1806
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:47,040
Play wouldn't blow up

1807
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,088
Studio

1808
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,648
Extinguisher

1809
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,696
It's clear that the camera operator

1810
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:57,792
Was very close to where is that

1811
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
The guy

1812
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
With a hatchet

1813
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:06,752
Crazy Horse

1814
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,056
It might hit one of the staff members

1815
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,360
Incredibly f***** up.

1816
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:16,224
Like a real crisis anything for him to have hit a gas line

1817
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,808
And then at the end of the show

1818
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,696
Click

1819
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:29,792
Click click

1820
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
Studio

1821
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:41,312
Is she

1822
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,104
Whoever's in charge

1823
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,128
Like it

1824
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
He keeps saying no one

1825
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,224
Here but there are people there

1826
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,552
Buckley or his dad

1827
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,368
Normally keeps them in check isn't

1828
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:58,464
Right

1829
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:06,400
You guys be cool I'm the I'm the fun guy on the place on your fun parent

1830
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:10,240
You guys want to smoke a little weed

1831
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,544
Cuz I'm going to throw a f****** Hatchet

1832
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
But I still think even though there's no Authority

1833
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:19,200
You're there he went too far

1834
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,784
Play go2 commercial they get done with this interview and he comes back

1835
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Commercial

1836
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,600
You've clearly been told

1837
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,368
You're done for the

1838
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:33,280
Infowars has given the gift of thought

1839
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:52,480
24 ninjas

1840
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:58,880
LeBron James

1841
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,904
Good looking

1842
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,280
Humanity

1843
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:08,864
Cplant hands are playing like a 10-minute

1844
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,656
Special Report

1845
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,216
Recorded apparently the day before

1846
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,240
In a hotel room

1847
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,800
It's it's

1848
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
Clearly an instance of like

1849
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
Whoever is

1850
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,176
Legs are and on the level is like Alex

1851
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,224
You're in no shape to be on air

1852
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:30,112
For no f****** reason

1853
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,208
Anyone

1854
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Weed eater

1855
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
You from yourself

You're done it's a third our own Benjamin will be here to host the fourth hour

1857
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:46,496
That's all you have to do

1858
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
You got to go to bed

1859
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,056
You got to take a napper

1860
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:55,456
You're a danger to yourself and show you off

1861
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
Truly

1862
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,784
You are a physical Danger

1863
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
Everyone

1864
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,880
Before you were even that drunk

1865
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,184
You told Rodger to contact

1866
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,464
Croissant

1867
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:12,864
We let you do the next 15 minutes really awful at

1868
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,912
Also is whenever he admits to committing

1869
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,704
Treason on-air you're like

1870
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,056
Yeah I don't know

1871
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,872
So that's that's where we we leave off cuz we

1872
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:24,640
Who cares about his

1873
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,176
James report

1874
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Is LeBron James report lot of bulshit

1875
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,928
Christmas

1876
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:43,840
Well I mean

1877
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,656
You know he got injured

1878
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,192
Say so that could be Alex

1879
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,240
Kirby

1880
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,544
Patriots

1881
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,824
Tara's grind

1882
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,920
So that could be Alex gets what he wants

1883
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688
We also get

1884
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,712
To have LeBron back

1885
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,760
Everybody wins

1886
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,320
I mean that

1887
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,136
This is all to say Merry Christmas to one and all

1888
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,160
This is

1889
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,184
This was crazy

1890
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
Because when I sat down

1891
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:14,816
Take a day off

1892
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,352
From the nonsense

1893
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,448
I thought it was going to be

1894
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,240
Retelling of the story of Christmas

1895
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:25,568
Maybe with him misinterpreting something right I thought it was going to be

1896
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:30,432
Funny like him trying to weave around the idea of not allowing immigrants

1897
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:35,296
Jesus would never have

1898
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:38,112
I would I would I thought there was going to be something like that

1899
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392
Repackaging of

1900
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Miss mythology

1901
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,952
Something

1902
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,768
We get I told Rodger

1903
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,792
Contact Julian

1904
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,560
Massage

1905
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:51,936
We get I'm drunk and throwing axe around the f****** Studio

1906
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,472
Incapable of evil

1907
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,288
It is just me so far gone

1908
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:59,104
Unpredictable on a level

1909
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,384
I know it's it's

1910
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,920
Itsfunneh if you detach

1911
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,200
A little bit

1912
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,016
Devoid of the world we live in this is hilarious

1913
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:09,088
Yes in the world we live

1914
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,880
And very sad

1915
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
If you're an uncle

1916
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,000
Goatee

1917
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:18,816
You go to your brother's sister's place

1918
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,096
And their kids are

1919
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
Hellraiser

1920
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,448
Throwing Shade all around that you're like hahaha uncle

1921
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,240
Yeah let's go

1922
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,848
But if you're the parents you're like

1923
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,176
Has burned

1924
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,480
Goddamn the White House to the ground

1925
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:40,320
Or is ruining everything

1926
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:42,880
If you're the uncle but you guys live in

1927
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
Like a duplex

1928
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,304
We have to share

1929
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
Department of

1930
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,912
Unfortunate how

1931
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,544
Beliefs

1932
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
But he's espousing

1933
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,688
Well Christmas Eve

1934
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,712
This is what he brings

1935
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,504
The table

1936
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,600
Play music clearly

1937
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:18,720
Like a hundred feet is 100% his way of expressing how guilty

1938
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,768
About all week

1939
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,304
Which is what you do

1940
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:29,728
Which it the thing that even crazier is like this fundamental premise of his

1941
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
Basically

1942
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:32,800
Christian

1943
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
White Western

1944
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,896
Like that is what he does that's what he's done

1945
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:39,200
Almost his entire career dating back to

1946
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:42,016
The days of Waco in Oklahoma

1947
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,600
Coming into Studio on Christmas Eve

1948
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,648
And doing some sort of a

1949
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,280
Fake intellectualized version of why Christmas is great

1950
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
And the fact that he can't even get there

1951
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
She's not having fun

1952
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,728
The only thing you can have fun with

1953
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,496
Anymore

1954
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,520
Is getting really drunk

1955
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,312
Throwing an axle rounded Studio

1956
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,848
And that doesn't bode well for

1957
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
For 2019

1958
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
Nope

1959
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:15,296
But if

1960
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:18,368
Episode

1961
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,136
The segment

1962
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
I'm in

1963
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,464
I feel empathy but at the same time I also thing

1964
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,512
Cell

1965
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:26,304
Whatever

1966
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
That

1967
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:29,120
Merry Christmas Alex

1968
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
Christmas Alex

1969
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
I wish you

1970
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,776
That one Christie who see what he does for New Year's

1971
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Probably be

1972
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,872
Oh man he is going to

1973
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,432
Jack's

1974
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,480
Countdown

1975
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:54,976
We find out that is

1976
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
Christmas gift

1977
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,048
Fort Worth

1978
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,376
That's what we learned earlier

1979
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:08,800
Everybody just in case anybody misses

1980
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:15,200
Episodes work in that like the single biggest news al-amin maybe literally said

1981
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,992
Did Rodger die

1982
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,808
Yeah it I mean yeah

1983
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,344
There is that

1984
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:24,672
The only reason I don't put too much stock in it is that

1985
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,464
I do believe Alex

1986
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,512
You saying that because it does it doesn't

1987
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,280
Feel like

1988
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
Is normal

1989
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,120
Expressing that

1990
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,448
And I know that

1991
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:42,848
I'm not telling your business is that he's defensive about telling you I don't want to save it

1992
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:49,248
If it was something that he was

1993
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,040
He was like I was there

1994
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,576
You know you were working at Fox News

1995
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,136
You came on Danforth I'll leave it at that

1996
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:58,208
The sort of thing that you always.

1997
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,256
I wanted to hire you on the

1998
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,280
A condition that you

1999
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Julian Assange

2000
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:05,888
I mean it's f***** up

2001
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
That's f*****

2002
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,448
But I still don't know

2003
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
What

2004
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
Actions hours to Tucker.

2005
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,080
The reach the level of

2006
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:16,128
Indyref

2007
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,712
Asian buffet

2008
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:24,320
It's not even like a Mueller's that's just like a regular FBI

2009
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,112
Regular SPI

2010
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Not invest

2011
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,256
Some sort of timeline

2012
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
Quest

2013
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
Sure does

2014
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,840
Like the idea of

2015
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,608
When was

2016
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:42,240
Obviously Alex does know because

2017
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
Cuz you told him to

2018
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
I don't know

2019
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,592
Wasn't

2020
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
While he was part of

2021
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,224
That's true

2022
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,296
And presumably after he's been Let Go by

2023
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
Is he doesn't have a game

2024
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,392
He gets this b******* off

2025
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,416
From Alex

2026
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:04,000
I want to help the Trump campaign out

2027
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:08,096
Which kind of leveraging is

2028
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,120
Even like

2029
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,912
Rodger

2030
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
Left

2031
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,984
Champagne

2032
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,520
You got fired I think that was

2033
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,592
Yeah I agree

2034
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
But

2035
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,408
He left in August

2036
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,688
Of 20

2037
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
I'm sorry

2038
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
2015

2039
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:28,576
Yeah

2040
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,880
Even after Trump was saying

2041
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:31,904
Maybe fire him and all that

2042
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,696
Rodger was very cool

2043
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
Clear public

2044
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,816
He still supported Trump

2045
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,584
Anti-hillary

2046
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,376
But it was also

2047
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,656
If if

2048
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,936
The perception was that

2049
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
He was fired it looks very magnanimous

2050
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,264
Still supports Trump

2051
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,312
Quit if you believe he

2052
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:52,384
It looks like he just believed so strongly in

2053
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,920
What Trump stands for

2054
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:57,248
His whole line on it was I wasn't being defective

2055
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,808
Champagne I could help out better outside

2056
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:02,624
He never even though he quit / got fired whatever

2057
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,696
Like even though that you never stopped supporting

2058
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,488
Yeah so from the jump

2059
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,768
In the campaign

2060
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,560
No matter at what point

2061
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
He was

2062
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,608
Trying to reach out

2063
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,448
Cast of trump or Alex

2064
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,752
Which is weird

2065
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,776
Reconsider

2066
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,128
Camp

2067
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
Hastobe

2068
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:30,016
That's the only way any of his axe

2069
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:37,184
Corsica

2070
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:41,024
Nixon.

2071
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,048
Nimrod for attention

2072
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,376
Stop Rodger will

2073
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,448
The the information

2074
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,216
Don't come out till 2

2075
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:49,984
Denial

2076
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,520
Fake news all the stuff

2077
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,800
Bobby Blue I tried to get

2078
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:54,080
In touch with them sure I was

2079
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:59,712
Yeah we're going to park because why bring something

2080
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,248
It'll be something

2081
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:07,392
Volcanoes have no idea all I know is what

2082
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,000
Massage

2083
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,304
I'm so Merry Christmas Alex

2084
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:16,864
Alex

2085
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,192
