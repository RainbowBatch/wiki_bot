1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:10,752
Alex

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Weird couple dudes

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,128
Sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Today we're drinking

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
Spark

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
It seems to be a go-to to ascertain

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
Maybe

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Today

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
Couple ship bars

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,304
Three or four shitbox

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
It was not great

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
And I know nothing about

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,032
That's the premise of the show I know a lot about him you don't know anything about him and we try and work through his weirdness

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:50,432
Play game of Scrabble last night at the bar but it was non-canonical

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Non-canonical from the Furious

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
Forever

17
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,952
To make it this far

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,488
Complicated

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Put it in the fryer and then hand it

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Stick

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Fry's

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
Yeah we should have known

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
There was vomit like right outside the box

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,800
Juliana

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
Fizzy water

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Which is delicious

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
To be back

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Dear Alex

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
I'd like to a couple things

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
First

31
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't I don't go to Paris

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,216
I mentioned this last night it's one of those things I really really hate about bars at some bars

33
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Big open windows

34
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
I think that some people

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Persuasion

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Exactly

37
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
They have a performative aspect

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
To their nights out

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,088
People get really dressed up and they want to be

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Look like they're having fun more than actually having fun

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
There's a large group of people that were spending most of the time they're at the pool table you wanted to play pool

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Couldn't because of them

43
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
And they were like doing

44
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,752
They were just overhyping how much fun they were having David Busters

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Exactly that and I know it's because there's a huge window to the street there they knew the people could watch them having fun

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
It was sponsored by the

47
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
I mean by theory that these people were dicks was like

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
Very well-established by when they came over

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
And a guy lectured you about low fives

50
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
Reminder of business wait for our food

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
You gave your girlfriend a low five

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,320
No ma'am

53
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
This is a friend

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,536
Is this that what's going on are you trying to be or do you think is going to be

55
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
What's going on I don't understand that mentality

56
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
I don't connect with people

57
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
How would that break the ice

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Just like

59
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
Low fives are bad

60
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,664
You are right most interesting man in the world

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,784
Elders of Zion

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
We had approaches

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
To dealing with this guy to cuz like you

64
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
We're kind of like you're an a******

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Very over-the-top fake laughing

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
Neither work

67
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
I think it's fair to say if you've listened to our show you understood the dynamic of how we react

68
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Exactly

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,224
Page right now and started we started the end of last week

70
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Started to post a lot more blog

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Content about Alex Jones

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
In the immediate

73
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
So what I'm listening the episodes I'm cutting clips

74
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
And writing up

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Debunking

76
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
Articles about f*****-up things

77
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
He says in real-time right

78
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Appreciate everybody's like them

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Shared them

80
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Interested in the show

81
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
I would really appreciate it

82
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
If you could go and

83
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
It makes such a big

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Books algorithm

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
And it's not one of these Alex Jones

86
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Right it's just how it works

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
If you have us like

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Make a fan page or whatever

89
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
It. Your contact doesn't get pushed all your fans unless you pay for it

90
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
But you can organically get around that through

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Like three or four or five people sharing thing

92
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
The ball starts rolling

93
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
It gets shown to a wider range

94
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
People

95
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Help in terms of

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Getting the word out

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
About things that we think are important about Alex

98
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
So if you could do that I appreciate

99
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
If you don't want to jump to it cuz I understand what it's like

100
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
I don't want to share a bunch of stuff on my I don't want my page getting cluttered up with a bunch of crazy people talk about Alex Jones

101
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
And if that's where you're at

102
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
I understand and frankly it's not where you're at

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,999
Who are you

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,375
Do you like your average bear

105
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959

109
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
The compound

110
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,015

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415

117
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
Accounts to attack people who made fun of his

118
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Who knows

119
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
Anything is possible call Ryan is itself

120
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Hating Republican

121
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Listen to

122
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047

00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
So this is my house

130
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,231
Yes sir I will give you a loaf I'd like to propose a metaphorical for the fact

131
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
But today we are back in

132
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
Thank God most recent shows of Alex's has not been fun

133
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
Not really all that interesting cuz he's mostly just going hard at Alfred

134
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
I don't disagree

135
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Did you get the pass

136
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
And anyway Alex

137
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Presenting it as like

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,855
The Liberals won't call the road to tasks and I cranked off everyone hates Lena Dunham

139
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Everybody's mad alpaca

140
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Yeah they're better than mine in a much more complicated way than Republicans

141
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Impossible

142
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Disappointment

143
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
And

144
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:37,215
You sorry you f***** up you got to go disappointment of like you had done some good things

145
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,079
The Senate you seemed like you were Yogi's real sharp in a lot of categories

146
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
The grilling people about climate change publicly helpful toward the cause of

147
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Just women

148
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
It's unfortunate but the reality is the reality of Bryce dealing with reality

149
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
Never give men any sort of power

150
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,327
Because chances are

151
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Perhaps

152
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Complicated way Alex

153
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Dealing with it isn't based

154
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
In reality

155
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
To score points

156
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
And the whole time he's

157
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Stocking with all these

158
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,943
People about like about Roy Moore and his whole perspective

159
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Yeah it's weird

160
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
You think

161
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
The time to talk about a joke

162
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
She absolutely raped

163
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
You know it and I know it.

164
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Came out and said

165
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
He basically like

166
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,287
Grabbed her head through to his crotch

167
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Can part of a parking

168
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
I mean that's not weird

169
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
No

170
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Let's Criminal

171
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,551
Yeah and it's so

172
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,159
Yeah it's possible that you could do you take right over that I do have one thing I wanted

173
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,279
This is sort of an out-of-context drop this is from the November

174
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
You chose this is from the present

175
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
And italics trying to

176
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
To score points

177
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
About his

178
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Sexual tastes

179
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
No no no no

180
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
What I like

181
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh no

182
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Girl

183
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
From the fifties I'll just sit there like an hour

184
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Now that's weird

185
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Waitress in a

186
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
Feel Like a Woman

187
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Really where

188
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
I mean there's a lot of things to unpack there

189
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,575
H2 sexual contact

190
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Like let's

191
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Let's be clear

192
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Do you like the fetishizing

193
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,743
Pin-up girls and that sort of aesthetic

194
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Often is

195
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Maybe a fetish

196
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
Is Asian of like women without power and are aware within were very subservient

197
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,871
I think there's some weird element there any ideas

198
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
An hour

199
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Just like

200
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,295
It's very much an uncomplicated life

201
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
I like women who cannot talk back

202
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
Only smile and who are never ever matter

203
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,559
A mannequin mannequin leg

204
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm not.

205
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
I've also not

206
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Blow up doll

207
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Charisma

208
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,567
My friend Sal from Columbia Missouri

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,919
190

210
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Decided he was going to do a setup

211
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,807
Hilarious

212
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Forwarded

213
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Pipefitter

214
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,463
He's an awesome guy

215
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,839
Now I'm super onboard I want a million of him

216
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Blow up dolls

217
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,311
Play blow up

218
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,199
I love it if that's that's always the best part best part of any kind of open mic

219
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Look

220
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
People who were working on jokes

221
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
I'm happy

222
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Yeah

223
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Lunatics

224
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,207
Now I'm now I'm excited he's a good kind of limited

225
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Some of the other sort

226
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
2016

227
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Yes

228
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
16 we last left off I believe online

229
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,287
The 11th

230
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
After the 11th there's a

231
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
String of boring

232
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Because Alex

233
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
It comes out that Chris Carter

234
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Is rebooting The X-Files

235
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
Okay is restarting the X-Files and one of the characters

236
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
No

237
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Not the Vikings

238
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
The guy who acts

239
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,327
X-Files was Loosely based on Alex

240
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Hehehe

241
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
In an interview says that Alex Jones

242
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Isn't

243
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
What he would consider to be super

244
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
He's more of a libertarian

245
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
And Alex takes that.

246
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
B a b positive

247
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Work

248
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Whatever

249
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
I don't matter to me really

250
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
The most important thing

251
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Fair but he goes on for about 2

252
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
Today's talking about how the X-Files is the biggest show of all time

253
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Even they know

254
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
Guys from The Lone Gunman

255
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Promotion

256
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Email hadn't even started on his

257
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
It had like maybe up was about to air

258
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
He goes on and on and on

259
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Two days straight just about how like X-Files loves me

260
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Chris Carter

261
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
The show

262
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
Best show of all time

263
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
The guy from The Lone gunmen

264
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Spin-off of The X-Files

265
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
And how one of the episodes

266
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
The CIA

267
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Contacted the lone gunmen writers

268
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,783
And told them to write 911 as a plot in the show

269
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
In order to prematurely inoculate the public

270
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
From thinking it was fake is like

271
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,767
It was in this episode

272
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
I don't do this I'm just listen to the episode

273
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
I meant David night host

274
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
A couple days

275
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,079
No so I jumped the next day that was

276
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Imagine what if we

277
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
We did David Knight episode

278
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
Would that even work

279
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
The audience would Revolt we would lose our walks

280
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Halfway through

281
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
Rage Quit like a online video game

282
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Olive Garden

283
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
Our will to live

284
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,447
Which is amazing the David Knight hasn't done the same to info

285
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Display

286
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
To do a well-trained

287
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
I want honest rest

288
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
I mean this sincerely

289
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Because

290
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
Our last episode that we covered was like on the 11th or the 12th

291
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
We're covering January 7th

292
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
Don't think of that doesn't mean I still had to listen to 15 hours of Alex Jones for nothing

293
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
Covering it all

294
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
But it took me

295
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
All that time

296
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Get to the 17th of January

297
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
2016

298
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
And boy was it worth it there a couple things that we're going to find out on this show that are

299
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
In terms of

300
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Proving

301
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
Fast and Furious that we had about Alex and then Beyonce

302
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
He's crazy

303
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
Sunday show so he's over

304
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
Some soft narrative that's what's about to happen. Especially one of those Sunday shows

305
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Those vets are the audience

306
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Is be smaller and

307
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
More engaged audience

308
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Is the refills free

309
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Let er Rip

310
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
I think he thinks he's a

311
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
That sounds good

312
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
In terms of the NFL

313
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
He's a little bit of an esoteric preacher especially when he's really really wrong about what

314
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
About what we'll find out if

315
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
I imagine it is Alex's

316
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,767
Today that's where you point the broadcaster will join

317
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Well we're on the 17th

318
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Right around Superbowl territory

319
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,703
February beginning of February was the Superbowl

320
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Carolina Panthers

321
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Unmanly

322
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
That I don't even know who played in the earlier playoff

323
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Today

324
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
You did it

325
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Dallas Cowboys

326
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Cool

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
But you know

328
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
When I realize that it's used as a propaganda tool

329
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
And that the patriotism

330
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Millions of dollars

331
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Well then I assume you support Colin Kaepernick

332
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Taking a nap

333
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
It because the patriotism is clearly paid for

334
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
And in fact the government pays the NFL

335
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
To pull all that b******* they started doing that around 2065

336
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
American Americano

337
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,991
So since he knows that it's just a money-making

338
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
Maybe he supports people

339
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
But like the other thing about it is like

340
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
The idea that he thinks that that's

341
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Some sort of like

342
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
Arcane secret thing

343
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
These presents

344
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
Idea that the government or the military pays to promote the military

345
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Of course

346
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
Of course that's advertisement

347
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,127
Haven't you seen the Army commercials

348
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Anybody could see

349
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
I don't understand why it's like

350
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
How they secretly do that

351
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
Classified that's David

352
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Commercials

353
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,559
You guys are screwing everybody commercials

354
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
What are the military services

355
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Real athletic

356
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,959
Tone to them

357
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Video game Soldier tone

358
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
Yeah it's

359
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
It's a different issue that he's complaining about

360
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
For those reasons

361
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
I'm glad that you can enjoy games

362
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
I'm glad

363
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
I guess it seemed through the b*******

364
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
And now doesn't want

365
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
He doesn't get into

366
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,423
Whatever from from dude male vitality

367
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
Exactly you know who does that

368
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Demasculinized

369
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
One of the more prescient films of our time

370
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
Really hate that man

371
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Unlike

372
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
Robin Williams in LL Cool J, he thought that that

373
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,815
TV segment was wack

374
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
I don't disagree with it

375
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Replace about sports

376
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
You makes this revelation

377
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Absolutely no sense

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
It indicates

379
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
Something other than

380
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,479
Enjoyment of sports and sports leagues

381
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Be complaining about

382
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Sports

383
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
I get it

384
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,255
No I've been awake

385
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
What year was it

386
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
The Red Sox finally win the World Series

387
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
10 years ago

388
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
2003

389
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,239
I was working on a film of the director who was into the Red Sox

390
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
And so I started

391
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
The office working late and then

392
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
World Series

393
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
It just took like a month or whatever but

394
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,647
I was calling my wife saying you know I'm sorry I'm going back out to

395
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,487
To watch the Red Sox I mean I get it

396
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Within

397
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
They

398
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
ESPN

399
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Bombast

400
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Do you have an addictive personality

401
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
I've been there

402
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Exactly

403
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,687
I think it was gambling

404
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
Behavior is not really

405
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
When

406
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
They like Cubs were in the World Series

407
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,815
Why would you just randomly there's no reason I mean I know he's hanging out with the Sox fan

408
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
Lifelong Texan

409
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
Is no reason for him to like the Red Sox

410
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,543
The time that was an amazing team Pedro Martinez

411
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
Throw fireballs

412
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
Remember

413
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
They came back from 3 down to BPM

414
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Monkeys that was

415
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
That was pretty much

416
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
Bead shop that happened

417
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
In my life

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
What was great

419
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,960
Real bloody Beats

420
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Covered in blood from the roast beef

421
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Okay

422
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
My buddy calling

423
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Buns

424
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Is butter the buns and put them in the toaster

425
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
You should have switched job now exists Superfund slow on it was always you

426
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,904
He got you decided he was going to make a rap album

427
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Waiting on bond

428
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,608
That's not a little update for good

429
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
Cuz I was like

430
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Cardinals

431
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
In the series

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,824
I like a gamble I like I bet you $100 that the Red Sox win this thing

433
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:13,248
Nothing I'm sorry about that collected from me if I had lost but

434
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
I did not

435
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Or not.

436
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,904
But be that as it may. What else is describing is not normal Sports washer behave

437
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:27,840
Absolutely that is like I got money on the spread honey I'll be home later I got to I got to watch the game

438
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Yep use my prop bets hit

439
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
You have someone in the morning track

440
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
I get 20 bucks there's no

441
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
You're going wild

442
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
Or just like because Sports

443
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Such an excuse

444
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Used to drink

445
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
It could be like an alcoholic

446
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,136
Best type of personality that's really all he's revealing their the problem he has with sports

447
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Is the problem he has with him

448
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
Sports reporter not the issue here

449
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
And that might be why he thinks

450
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Sports takes away people's like

451
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Virility in there

452
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Enthusiasm

453
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
Because it does for him

454
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:10,848
He gets f***** up by him as we have found elsewhere he's a world-class

455
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Yeah that's true

456
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Eastgate movie theater

457
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
Your job and put the projectionists

458
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
A little bit about science

459
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Okay

460
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
That's why he's wrong

461
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,696
And the systems written countless books countless University

462
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
Studies white papers

463
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Research studies they had others

464
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,216
Able to get 9 out of 10 or more

465
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
People

466
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
Subject

467
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Will come up

468
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
I did

469
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
We're students believed they were killing Subs

470
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
Took a week or so

471
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
That's not how that works

472
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
And most people with the

473
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Kill

474
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Under pressure

475
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
From the 40s

476
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Ocean Avenue

477
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Pacifica

478
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
And that's what this is all been about

479
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,328
So that's the one that's about the Nuremberg trials

480
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Actually is

481
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Okay sounds good

482
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
Is it possible that these people were just following orders

483
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,312
And so what they did is they had it set up where One

484
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Subject

485
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
The test subject was in a room with an experiment

486
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
How to dial

487
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
No

488
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,856
Had a button fairly certain that was the dial one or they had it was like it would turn up every

489
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:03,488
Turn up the knob knob

490
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
How work was Yeti experimenter and you had the subject

491
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
And in the other room the Next Room

492
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
You had to be

493
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
The plant who was working with the

494
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
And supposedly another subject of the study

495
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,872
So you and experimenter the role the subject was

496
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
To be a teacher

497
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
And the this

498
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
The other subject in the other room supposed to be the student

499
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
And is

500
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Setup has experience

501
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
The subject

502
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Would be sitting there

503
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
And they would try and get

504
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
The other person in the other room

505
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
2

506
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Guess a word based on another word

507
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
There was a word game they were playing

508
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
And whenever they got an answer wrong they were supposed to shock the other per

509
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Now

510
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,312
The experimenter turn up the volume

511
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,408
And if the person who was the subject of the study who's asking

512
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Questions

513
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Teacher

514
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,528
If they said to the experimenter I don't think we should do this

515
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
They would rub them for time

516
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
And if they made it past the fourth rebuttal the experiment would end

517
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,256
That was the whole idea to see how much people would push back against party

518
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
And they did find that most people very unhappy went along with it right the other way the experiment ended was

519
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
You did up to 450 V which is enough to

520
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Theoretically

521
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,104
They were told it was enough to kill regardless Central piece

522
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,688
Experiment misrepresenting

523
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
I mean 65 V

524
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,064
It's not electricity

525
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Not about voltage

526
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
It's about current

527
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
When it comes down

528
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
2

529
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Electricity

530
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
And it also comes down

531
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
To like you have a wound

532
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Skin is a really good conductor

533
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
For the most part of electricity but if you have

534
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
Cut or something like that

535
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Is going

536
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
It's going to be a disaster

537
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
It's not

538
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
DD works together being like

539
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Kill this man

540
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,712
Or something like that

541
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
What they learned was pretty shocking

542
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
Here's the other most important piece and Alex

543
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Cuz not talkin about

544
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
The Milgram experiment

545
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,952
It is historically seen as not that great of experiment

546
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Here's why

547
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Every road was dude

548
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Yeah

549
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
No s***

550
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
Well I mean if your Ridgeway was all do

551
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,960
If you are going to test that as a Nuremberg Trial

552
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Situation though

553
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Not a lot of nuts

554
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Female Soldier

555
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
In that regard

556
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,640
Was it was at the

557
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
The time

558
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Military

559
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
All dude

560
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,808
Except for the Russian military cuz they

561
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
Needed everybody

562
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,696
But yeah right but you can't experiment goes

563
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't think he is

564
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
Misrepresenting it and getting a lot of details wrong

565
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
But based on what he is saying

566
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
I think he

567
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
He's got the spirit of what he's trying to take her

568
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,800
Which is that it's weird that people would be willing to murder

569
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Because of

570
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,504
If that's all he's trying to say in the first set of experiments 65 Briggs

571
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
26 out of the 40 experiment

572
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,648
Participant

573
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
65%

574
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
450

575
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Do you vote shock

576
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Though many were very uncomfortable doing so

577
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
At some point

578
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Participant paused in question

579
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,336
The experiment some said they would refund the money they're paid

580
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Participating

581
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
Throughout the experiment subjects display varying degrees

582
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Stressed subjects were sweating trembling stuttering biting their lips groaning their fingernails into their skin

583
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Nervous laughter

584
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah it's a relief

585
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
I'm passing he does mention

586
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
That he also brings up another super f***** up one

587
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
There there

588
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
They are described

589
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,248
Less as experiments and more as kind of philosophical question

590
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
And

591
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
The Stanford Prison Experiment

592
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Is a

593
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
If it were

594
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,584
If the strictures of the experiment were applied elsewhere

595
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
It would be immediately invalidate

596
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,008
No no biological science know any of science any of the hard science

597
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
Would ever accept those

598
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,480
Rules as well as a valid experience more or less anecdotal in nature

599
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Still

600
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
It is

601
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
The Stanford Prison Experiment

602
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
You can still draw some

603
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,720
Conclusions from that but you can't draw conclusions

604
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
You can just notice

605
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Hey human beings are f***** up

606
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
You know what they almost are

607
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,424
They almost are good ways to inoculate people from that behavior

608
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
You're in the future

609
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Quote experiment

610
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
It's they're done the demonstrated point

611
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
Can see it Illustrated in real-time though like I hope I wouldn't do that

612
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
More aware of the influence

613
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,392
Authority figures or in the case of the prison

614
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Experiment

615
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,768
They're more aware of the idea of US versus them mentality is a Breakout

616
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
Artificially it just naturally wherever

617
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,472
Well and the old the only problem with that though is

618
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:38,336
It doesn't seem to matter you know we have a very good experiment about how Nazism works

619
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Apparently people are still fine with it

620
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Yeah that's

621
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
That's really true

622
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,272
Oh well really interesting studies

623
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Again because they are invalid

624
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,160
There's a note just by the very fact

625
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Being you being aware that is

626
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Experiment

627
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,376
And you're being paid means that you're you know like if I'm in that situation

628
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
With a

629
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
An experiment

630
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Bababababa

631
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
There's also the part of your brain that goes

632
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
Well there's no way they would allow me to kill

633
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
So there is a artificial

634
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Whatever

635
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,488
That's f***** up

636
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,632
You want to go back to the f****** Tuskegee experiment they're fine with killing people

637
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah that's true

638
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
That was back when science was more of like a

639
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:43,104
Somebody go f****** whatever

640
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,712
Is wrong about

641
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
He's writing a small sentence wrong in a big sentence about these

642
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,672
Experiment as it so often the case when we say he is right

643
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
Is generally speaking a very very small

644
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
F****** fool you okay

645
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
The history of reading

646
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
Brain magazine

647
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
In different Publications that work

648
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
Ugly

649
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
Beautiful

650
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
Destroy the discrimination

651
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,696
Factors in the brain between what is good and what is that

652
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
Brainy Publications

653
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
I came to I don't know if you guys remember that one go back to the March 30th episode

654
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
For that sucking

655
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
Super fun time

656
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
So his idea

657
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
So as he understands

658
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
The cia's plan

659
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Yeah it is to

660
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Put out

661
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Right

662
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Credit good

663
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Yes

664
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
That

665
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
Is a great CIA plant

666
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
And I would have fun tomorrow

667
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:08,352
The idea of like hard what is beautiful in

668
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
What is ugly

669
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:15,520
Anecdotes

670
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,640
I actually just let a monkey paint piss and it sold for a million dollars

671
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
What are you what are you talkin about going to discredit our

672
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
The art world is already fabricated

673
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
There's a truth

674
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
2

675
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
To some of this

676
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
The CIA did

677
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
Help promote people like Jackson

678
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
Kampala Mark rothko in Willem de kooning

679
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Diesel abstract expressionism

680
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Back

681
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
In their time

682
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,032
They did and it was a

683
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Piece of the Cold War strategy

684
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Okay

685
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
The Cold War The Artist

686
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
I'm reading here from an article in open culture about this the artists themselves were completely unaware that their work was

687
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Being used as propaganda

688
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
On what age is called a

689
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,024
They participated in several exhibitions secretly organized by the CIA

690
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Such as the new American Paint

691
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,912
Which visit European cities

692
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
And included the stuff

693
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Modern primitive works

694
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
The surrealist

695
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
William

696
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Basquiat

697
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
1947

698
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
A 1951

699
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
By Adolf Gottlieb

700
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
And 1984

701
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
Super f***** up painting

702
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
Like a Bazaar

703
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Okay

704
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Next question

705
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
And this is very serious

706
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
What's the CIA behind the data

707
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,144
They were behind row Coco

708
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,496
So the idea that what they were doing

709
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Is

710
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
You have this art

711
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
And it's not really

712
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Casein is all that great over here

713
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
But you have people in Russia

714
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Gore used to

715
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Very conch

716
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
Play because

717
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
And there

718
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Totalitarian

719
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Berber control over Arts

720
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
So you had basic

721
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Sickly the art that was approved is like

722
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
Realistic paintings of Stalin

723
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,960
Like that that's what flies over there

724
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
Promotion in Europe

725
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
This

726
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,128
Very bizarre American art is going to lead to

727
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Positive America

728
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,712
Because they're going to see America is

729
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
Avant-garde

730
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,088
I got to try to be so different from what they're used to

731
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:43,232
That is the strategy that the CIA was employing as a way of culturally piercing the Soviet Union

732
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Okay

733
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
Is what they were doing has nothing to do with trying to warp the minds of good and bad and

734
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
If the CIA was exporting Super Mario Brothers to North Korea right now

735
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
Yes

736
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,944
Sometimes I wish we could go back to

737
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
Cold War the stories of what the CIA did during the Cold War

738
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
And how they had

739
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
So little oversight

740
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
All of theirs

741
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
All of their plans were we're Rube Goldberg machine

742
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Expense

743
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
Aztec how silly they were

744
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,632
So much rooting through garbage and like

745
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,216
Okay what if we implant this thing inside a mouse

746
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
It's a little recording device

747
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:31,872
And maybe the mouse will go into the boardroom and windows

748
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,480
What is this are you guys mad scientist

749
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Happening

750
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
Action of desperation and like

751
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Early technology

752
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
The military-industrial complex run-amok

753
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Technology

754
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,424
And then you add lack of oversight

755
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Because of Desperate Times

756
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
The real

757
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
Severe

758
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
We could argue all day about whether that was

759
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Overblown

760
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
The fears that we had about the Soviet Union back then

761
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Uno's

762
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Is all imaginary

763
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,928
Not gotten what I would call close calls we had with the nuclear warfare destroying the Earth

764
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,768
Here's a really good but those fears should have been more toward

765
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
Okay wait so we're giving nuclear weapons

766
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
To a bunch of

767
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
And we are a bunch of idiots

768
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
Nuclear weapons through a bunch of idiots

769
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,872
They leave like 5

770
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Documented Indie classes

771
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Defied

772
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,992
Instances of like one dude coming down

773
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,808
Press the button or not

774
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
A couple but

775
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,208
Assume that it's more than I'm aware of

776
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Just died in

777
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Yeah

778
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
The Russian guy who against all orders from a superior

779
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
It was like

780
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,800
Save the world. Never allowed

781
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Speak of it

782
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
That's what happens

783
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
We've not got into today's being yet

784
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
Behold episode

785
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Football

786
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
No restarted

787
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
The Reds

788
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
No

789
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,048
Lose a lot of money

790
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,120
He's betting against the spread stupid

791
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
A bad idea

792
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,448
Basketball

793
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
He has

794
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,264
A very bizarre

795
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Lead us through most of the rest of the

796
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Episode and boy

797
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
Strap it in

798
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Real

799
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Yes

800
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
100

801
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
We're going to end up

802
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Where does it say that in the Bible

803
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Say that many of my Christian list

804
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
Viewers get extremely angry

805
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,064
Yep

806
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
Someone disagrees with

807
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
About something

808
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
The deity of Jesus Christ

809
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
You got a problem with it become a Pharisee

810
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
If you want to believe

811
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
Your business

812
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
I don't think

813
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
You have been

814
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Grievously

815
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
Bible

816
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
Very excited about that next hour

817
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Does he not get the irony of him

818
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Somebody disagrees with

819
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
About everything

820
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
You got a problem which implies that if you have a disagreement about the Trinity or Jesus is Divinity then that's not a problem

821
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Also

822
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
Does it say in the Bible do they ever talk about the Holy Spirit

823
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,656
A ghost is in there come on.

824
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,752
I don't know I don't unpack that

825
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,848
I don't know if you guys have no I have heard

826
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
Interesting might have a problem

827
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,416
Well we don't disagree on the Holy Trinity by like the most best bibles if you look at number of verses

828
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Especially

829
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
I kind of just

830
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Count most of the old.

831
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
Jesus

832
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
Arrival

833
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,888
Sacrifice invalidates

834
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
Frank creates a new cover

835
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,776
And yet somehow we're still listening to people tell us about the Old Testament

836
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,616
With all due respect to the Jewish Folk

837
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
Do have a lot of the old

838
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
In their in their holy books

839
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
But it should just be historical

840
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,136
And not because of Jesus literal because of matter all because of Jesus

841
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
So did the things that I really resonate with

842
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
Bible if you want to talk about it

843
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,304
It is Jesus being

844
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
The Rockin that that that sort of idea

845
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Says things

846
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
To be effective you will do what I do and greater

847
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,592
Difference in Houston

848
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
If you look at it that way

849
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
The idea that Jesus is

850
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Is God

851
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
That sort of divinity within him is the Divinity that

852
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
It's within all of us

853
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
I can buy bond that

854
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
If you want a Vibe I can Vibe on that

855
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
You can't though

856
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
Because Christians do not believe

857
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,023
Too busy talking about the Wrath of the Ulta

858
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Alex

859
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
I'm very

860
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
This episode

861
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
F****** bent out of shape about the rapture

862
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Furious

863
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
And I think what has happened in the in the Pro or the con

864
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
He thinks the Raptors real rhino

865
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,503
Oh he thinks

866
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
The pre-tribulation rapture

867
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Alright

868
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,719
Let's get into this I want to dive in here I don't know if you've been paying attention

869
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
But throughout the last like

870
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Baby

871
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
1012 episode

872
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
There's been a guy who key

873
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Keeps calling in

874
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Yeah there's a guy who keeps

875
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
Keeps calling into Alex's show

876
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
When trying to explain the pre

877
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,871
Tribulation

878
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,223
Keeps like telling about I want to have this device called

879
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,415
Voices like I will talk to you later

880
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,231
And I think this guy has finally gotten to Alec

881
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,351
Cuz get on the show spent almost the entire time talking about how stupid pre-trib

882
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Rapture is

883
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Great

884
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:25,311
Find me up for that as well

885
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Ovulation Rapture is

886
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,407
So Alex Belize post-tribulation

887
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
And that's because somehow

888
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Even dumber

889
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,807
What's because in the Bible or at least in Alex isn't

890
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Interpretation of Revelation

891
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
And I guess

892
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Video

893
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
Somebody prophetic books of the Bible

894
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,279
He believes that they're all right

895
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,815
The Antichrist comes

896
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
Yes and leaves us to real bad time

897
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,471
Real bummer almost as bad as Trump

898
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Dude really worse

899
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:59,615
So we go through that lot of the world dies out

900
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,175
Amman God comes back

901
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
In the battle of Armageddon

902
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:11,391
Exactly

903
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:15,743
How to lose a lot of money

904
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:31,615
You got Jesus and the field

905
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:36,735
I'm not going to take the field not going to gamble in Armageddon

906
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,551
And he's Furious that I think a lot of his listeners

907
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,671
Are trying to convince him of the pre-tribulation Rapture in the Antichrist comes

908
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
The faithful go to heaven if they don't doubt this whole trouble

909
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Write the troubles as it were

910
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
He's mad because

911
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Alex believe

912
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
That

913
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Is a globalist

914
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Yes I wish

915
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:15,391
I wish I wasn't all right I wish I wish I was joking I wish I was just like a good bit

916
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,719
It's not

917
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,071
I think you spelled it out in this next clip and I'll just play this and we can discuss it on the other end

918
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,167
God would protect

919
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Providence

920
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
But you have to go through the fire first

921
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Until dawn

922
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
Like the Christians

923
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Take action

924
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Spread

925
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,839
A billion Christians

926
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
And do not be involved and let the devil take over the world

927
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
That is

928
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,295
Crises and Evil on this planet that they should just

929
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
Lucky 13

930
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Out of context

931
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
So

932
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Alex believe

933
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,023
This interpretation

934
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
The pre-tribulation rapture

935
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,399
Is something that is being taught in the

936
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,751
Glitterbug churches in what have you as a way of taking away the

937
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,079
Activism and power of the billion Christian

938
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
They could be fighting the devil

939
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:44,223
If you devil and eat the does imply that it's the globalist or doing this

940
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,807
He got a caller calls in all of the world religion

941
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,647
Like Islam Buddhism Christianity they all met in Seoul Korea

942
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
Seoul Korea South Korea conversation

943
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,655
All these religions came together and decided that ended

944
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
Comedy of it is

945
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
This color is listed off the religious we like Christianity Islam Buddhism Alex

946
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
You guys keep going

947
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,391
Worship in the trees or whatever

948
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Shintoism

949
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,583
Very very small population but I love the idea

950
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Throwing something

951
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
Myself sound smart

952
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,311
I've never read the gospel

953
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
Like the synoptic Gospels

954
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,687
Happy birthday Ken Jeong

955
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
Word hey

956
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
Let's not

957
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Fight

958
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
Assholes

959
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
Turn the other cheek

960
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Slade

961
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,327
Yeah you have them read the book of Romans 13 and maybe go back in if you just refer

962
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:08,703
Pressure course it's really actually pretty f***** up because it is

963
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
You should submit to your rulers

964
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,079
Because their representatives of God

965
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,383
It's one of the reasons it's one of the

966
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
That they've used for

967
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Slavery

968
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
Over many many years

969
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
Further Authority is God's servant for your good if you do wrong

970
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
The sword for no reason

971
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
They are God's servants

972
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Crafts to bring punished

973
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Turn on the wrong door

974
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,303
Therefore it's necessary

975
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
To submit to Authority

976
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
Not because of possible

977
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
Also as a matter of

978
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
Next paragraph deals with that give everyone what you owe them

979
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
If you owe taxes pay taxes

980
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Is revenues and revving

981
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Respect respect

982
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
If honor than honor

983
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
It's almost as though

984
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Is written by somebody

985
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Vested interest

986
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Maintaining power

987
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
Crazy

988
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:02,207
Wild asparagus

989
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
To all the Commandments

990
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,095
Can be summed up in the one command love thy neighbor as yourself

991
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Love does no harm to a neighbor

992
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,911
Therefore love is.

993
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
Fulfillment of the law

994
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Great

995
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,335
Part about it

996
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
Starting at verse 11

997
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:25,759
Understanding the present time the hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber

998
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Because our Salvation is

999
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,831
Is nearer now than when we first believed

1000
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Which

1001
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Is altruism

1002
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,695
If there is an end eventually

1003
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
Then right now

1004
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Sooner than it was earlier

1005
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,911
The night is nearly over the day is almost here so let us put aside the Deeds of Darkness

1006
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
Put on the armor of light

1007
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,287
Let us behave decently as in the daytime not a rousing and drunkenness not

1008
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,847
Sexual immorality and debauchery

1009
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Not into sentient

1010
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,431
Jealousy rather close yourselves with the Lord

1011
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Jesus Christ

1012
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,991
And do not think about how to gratify the

1013
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Desires of the flesh

1014
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,575
Almost counterintuitive

1015
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,391
The night is coming tonight is almost over and

1016
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
And the day is almost here

1017
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,279
Means I should go f*** as much as I want

1018
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
Cuz the nights about.

1019
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
I got to go to work

1020
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
Something's coming

1021
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
Practice

1022
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Being good

1023
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:28,991
Piano easy the first time

1024
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
We got to practice being decent

1025
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Or something

1026
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,647
I don't understand exactly how that Passage

1027
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
Does weaponized outside of

1028
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Literally

1029
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Interpreting it as

1030
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Submissive Authority

1031
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,351
Yeah which is their events in your holy book

1032
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
So

1033
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
Deal with it

1034
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,983
Deal with it that's not a Miss that's not misrepresentation what that mean

1035
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Nope it's

1036
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Actually literally what

1037
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
Salsa

1038
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Don't think so

1039
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
Is the mark of the beast real Jordan

1040
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Maybe your headphone

1041
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
Is your headphones off

1042
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
At this point

1043
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Do you believe them

1044
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
World where to live in

1045
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
Under the sea

1046
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
Everything everything

1047
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Distorted

1048
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
A false reality

1049
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Sports in our consciousness

1050
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
Even the elect

1051
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
The modern

1052
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Antichrist system

1053
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,255
Thomas in my life

1054
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Still

1055
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
Academically

1056
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
Boy I tell you it is bone-chilling

1057
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
It's not

1058
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Very bones

1059
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Alex is on his tip

1060
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Is that you

1061
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,431
He's worked up about the Revel Revelation in biblical prophecy coming

1062
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,039
Beyond that later he does sort of spell out what the world is going to look like in of course

1063
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
It's just

1064
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,671
And then I'll be on that key

1065
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
The other thing is

1066
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Just

1067
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,071
He reveals that like

1068
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
Anna

1069
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
Yep that's not that's not great

1070
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
That's the way it's supposed

1071
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,383
Yeah after this point

1072
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Alex is a mother

1073
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Now we got to talk

1074
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
Thank you

1075
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Look up a genetic engineering

1076
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,487
Look at the elites

1077
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,071
Brown inside cows

1078
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,119
Logan

1079
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,447
Can I look at

1080
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
I just thought of something

1081
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Responsibility

1082
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
You going to get

1083
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:25,887
Just like Planned Parenthood infiltration

1084
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,215
They are committing crime

1085
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
I know that I don't

1086
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Nope you guys.

1087
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
Cuz they're not

1088
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
Mor Furniture

1089
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,479
Helen Clark keeping babies alive for harvesting

1090
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
No

1091
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,319
Physician retired and I remember

1092
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
Dentist

1093
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,135
Going to get my driver's license

1094
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,463
We're back to the story as but I do want

1095
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,279
Just take a second before we move on cuz there's another minute of this clip

1096
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
I do want Alex to go save those kind

1097
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,399
I agree that would be the best

1098
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
TruTV show ever

1099
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:05,823
Absolutely make a make another season of Jesse Ventura

1100
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,223
Instead of Ghost Hunters Chimera go to Bastrop

1101
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,271
Alex Jones dad being a f****** weirdo

1102
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,367
My hardship license because I have a job in a small animal vet

1103
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
This one is picked out of school

1104
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Don't

1105
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
I would say Dad

1106
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,191
I would say why would you say that

1107
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
Here's why

1108
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
Drug addicts

1109
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,607
It came out with Jon rappoport

1110
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,911
Pretty well debunked

1111
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,727
No this is what we talked about that yeah

1112
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:13,919
Dentist father wonder he's f***** up his

1113
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:18,527
Only affected black people a race specific bioweapons

1114
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Who's getting more

1115
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
Is because the applicant the way people use drugs

1116
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,959
Come up with are so much more complicated than the reality

1117
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Season if you share blood with somebody

1118
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,543
You're going to get the disease

1119
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,103
But be that as it may.

1120
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,479
That's crazy the response

1121
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
To Alex's like hey why shouldn't I sign my organ donor card

1122
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,879
Is even Wild

1123
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Hold on

1124
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
What if we look at all of this

1125
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
As just

1126
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
Alex Jones

1127
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
Dad

1128
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,143
Was f****** with his son I don't think is working with

1129
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,447
You think he's nuts

1130
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Forget the front

1131
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Sure

1132
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
People listen to it

1133
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,143
Alex Jones is the CIA

1134
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,519
Yeah

1135
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Like

1136
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
It was just dads

1137
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
Dinner table talk

1138
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
The hospital for your organs

1139
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,695
What is your printer

1140
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:09,119
So now we know where Alex do we know where Alex gets that

1141
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,935
My dad didn't think it was important to

1142
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,495
Prove the claim that he's making that are wild

1143
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:21,663
Clear

1144
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
I mean

1145
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Much greater understanding

1146
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
The science can debunk all the

1147
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Just for you if you want to go look

1148
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:36,767
Go to Jon rappoport site

1149
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Thanks for

1150
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
That helps

1151
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
And then you'd be like

1152
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
No that's

1153
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,911
Dumb also

1154
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
This Chimera ship

1155
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Is wild

1156
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Because it is just a

1157
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,335
Like the article just

1158
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Scream out

1159
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:56,223
Human human chimeras are

1160
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:02,111
Gestating on Animal Farms

1161
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Google headlines

1162
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
And what have you

1163
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
He's going to ramble about it

1164
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
For a little bit here and it goes

1165
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,071
To some crazy places

1166
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
It's just

1167
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Something like this

1168
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
Human-animal chimeras

1169
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,055
Gestating on Research Farm

1170
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Is it

1171
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,039
Is it is it

1172
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
Why

1173
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,287
That board

1174
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,103
Fast forward

1175
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,759
So now let's pause right there and discuss the science of this

1176
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:06,111
I think Alex Alex think

1177
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:12,511
The only reason our our organs aren't Biggers cuz we don't have enough room

1178
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,399
Okay

1179
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
Alright I can't do that

1180
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:28,639
They want to put human organs in the couch because cows have more space

1181
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,943
You want to do.

1182
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:38,111
Maybe that was a design flaw with god with God's plan in the first place if he knew we were going to drink so much

1183
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
Ezekiel now that's your pre-trib rapture right there

1184
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
I think there's some comedy some value in

1185
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,935
That being said right after the HIV is a race specific Style

1186
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,311
We want to use these human animal chimera

1187
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
The question

1188
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
Exactly

1189
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:10,623
Sperm whale and they're still mammals we could get us

1190
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,183
Liver the size of your f****** whole body

1191
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
Exactly I love how you always obviously review

1192
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
Sing by saying he's not doing

1193
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:28,543
Listen and I'm not bragging

1194
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,943
Exact same thing over and over again hundred articles but I only talk about this one ever

1195
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
What a dick

1196
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,415
I was reporting on this out of white paper

1197
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
It was 10 years old

1198
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
That's when they admitted it

1199
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,311
Takeoff

1200
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Cheap

1201
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
And go to the part spider in that they

1202
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,903
I said okay

1203
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
I should know you're a liar

1204
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,399
But yeah I did

1205
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,495
Which is why I know that when you go

1206
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
I just so you better get out of my

1207
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:44,319
Coveralls

1208
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,535
Been in hundreds of Publications

1209
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
That

1210
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Time

1211
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
I have the CEO on

1212
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
My show

1213
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,727
Running program

1214
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:08,895
The first of all spider goats are real but also I do love just the way he says that's it

1215
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
The

1216
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:16,319
Video with running an apartment with the goats

1217
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,207
The goat for the employees reading the Department of Defense or whatever

1218
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:28,095
Leadership

1219
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,263
Is another question another population between the leadership

1220
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
Crossbreed

1221
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:43,711
What leadership is not accepted

1222
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
Chords back in the day

1223
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,767
Yeah but if they could go discontent together

1224
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,327
I got to do

1225
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
That's what I can't deal with

1226
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
The emergency centers establishment Act

1227
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
The civilian inmate labor camp program

1228
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
Is it

1229
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
FEMA camp

1230
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,415
It's all for political dissenters

1231
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:34,399
Well if you if you would like to recall that episode where we did the the

1232
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
The

1233
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,543
The speed lightning round and discuss all of those FEMA

1234
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,079
Alex

1235
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Just making stuff

1236
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Very much

1237
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:49,247
Except for the civilian labor camps

1238
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:55,391
We have a private prison

1239
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,463
Industry in our country that is enslaving

1240
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
Rexall

1241
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
If you

1242
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,303
If you want to talk about both

1243
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
I support it

1244
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,375
Going to talk about one not the other

1245
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
Talk about the private prison

1246
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
More big deal

1247
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Now

1248
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,335
But wait dan private

1249
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,151
Absolutely oversight

1250
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
No regulations

1251
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:22,271
What they should do is give those civilian inmates

1252
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,599
Totally

1253
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
I don't know where we're talking about anymore

1254
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,607
In a little bit

1255
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,543
There's some more thought rest in peace Malcolm Young thoughts about the devil and about the rapture

1256
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,335
But this next

1257
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Clip

1258
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
This is Mike down clip

1259
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
Alex Jones

1260
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
Make like

1261
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
This next clip

1262
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Is basically like

1263
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
I have been looking for this clip

1264
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
4A

1265
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
So you falling in love

1266
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
No

1267
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
I found a woman that you want to marry

1268
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
No no

1269
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
Something like this

1270
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Come out of Alex's mom

1271
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,423
Can you deliver

1272
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Desk lamp

1273
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Is so f***

1274
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,335
In hindsight knowing what we know now

1275
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
About the Russian

1276
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,199
Influencer campaigns that we're running from the summer

1277
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:28,319
Of 15

1278
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,343
6 months later

1279
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
Listen to this

1280
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,767
And Obama gets up on TV and says everything's fine

1281
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,839
Everything's wonderful. Wonderful

1282
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,863
Ladies and gentlemen

1283
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
I meant on your 21 years

1284
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
Volume level one.

1285
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,543
Profits went up to find the op

1286
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Double the last 6 months

1287
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
Fastest growth rate

1288
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,735
We got so many Lester's that makes my head spin

1289
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,271
And profits are flat

1290
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
Even finally operation

1291
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:05,183
That's why we know this is serious fact

1292
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,255
Scotland

1293
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,863
Purchase high-quality products

1294
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,423
Delta

1295
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
Our voices

1296
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
Then ever

1297
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,263
Oh s***

1298
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,103
Oh s*** idiot

1299
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,455
First of all nights at pivot

1300
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
He just revealed that

1301
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:34,367
They've doubled

1302
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:41,279
I guess that must be the economy that must mean that Obama is lying about all these statistics that pee

1303
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
People are putting out about the

1304
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,423
Boxer listening to the show.

1305
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
There's not a

1306
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
There's not a chance

1307
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
In my mind

1308
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,943
B on some subconscious level

1309
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
Buy now 2017

1310
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
Alex knows

1311
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
God damn well that's what he

1312
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Really he has to

1313
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:10,207
I think that's why he's fighting so hard now trying to make the Russian stuff

1314
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
Casinos

1315
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,559
I have been a

1316
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:19,935
Is evident

1317
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
No

1318
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
But it's obvious

1319
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,823
Right it's like

1320
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,175
I don't know how to come up with a good analogy about that but

1321
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,223
Apex it it's like

1322
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,319
Alex talking to his hypothetical friend got tricked by the Nigerian

1323
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,975
I'm going to make a lot of money

1324
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
There's nothing there

1325
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,351
Alex is talking and playing like we have gotten

1326
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:52,191
Weis the listeners in the last six months as we had before

1327
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,983
But no one's buying anything

1328
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,031
We can hear that and we're like

1329
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Oh dude

1330
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,407
We literally know exactly what happened

1331
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
And that that to me

1332
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
That's that

1333
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,087
Game over game over on his

1334
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,927
First of all his audience size secondarily

1335
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,231
That he was not being

1336
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Specifically Target

1337
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,303
Biopsies Russian

1338
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
Royal Farms

1339
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,679
Yeah been compromised by Russia in

1340
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
So many ways

1341
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:31,103
You've revealed it all on your own and all we had to do to figure it out was paying attention to your dumbass

1342
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Wow

1343
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
Congratulations

1344
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:39,551
Now look at BuzzFeed

1345
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:45,951
What an idiot you have to be like if we saw a doubling of our numbers

1346
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,679
Buttercream

1347
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,591
What and that's why it's so easy to Hoodwink him like that cuz he expects

1348
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:07,711
Of course my listeners double because I'm right and of our listeners double would be like

1349
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:14,111
Listen to this God damn show

1350
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,135
His version of it is

1351
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:19,999
Finally people are waking up and thank God I've been doing this work all the time

1352
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,559
Coming home

1353
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,887
What have you robots

1354
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
What a f****** idiot

1355
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,215
I love it when I heard that

1356
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Nailed it

1357
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,847
Cuz every other time it's been very

1358
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,919
Nonspecific and he just said that the numbers have gone up

1359
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
In that time

1360
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,735
Yeah but the fact that he's

1361
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
The numbers are going up

1362
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
Sales

1363
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,647
What exponentially the numbers have gone up sales

1364
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:54,047
Have stayed exactly the same he's right those two numbers and think something is up the wrong thing

1365
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,095
And now we know he knows

1366
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
Now we know he knows exactly what happened

1367
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,519
Cuz he and he hasn't revealed that

1368
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Pinterest

1369
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,663
How would how old how do you think

1370
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
His listeners would respond

1371
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
If they

1372
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
New exactly

1373
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
What was going on

1374
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,135
If I don't

1375
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
You just learn

1376
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
That

1377
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
A hostile foreign power

1378
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Who's artist

1379
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,375
Officially inflated the influence of an Alex

1380
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,191
Different right-wing thing

1381
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,983
Exactly how would you take

1382
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,567
The Russians are right

1383
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
Because Alex has the built-in narrative that Russia are the good guys and what I do look at it as I

1384
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:50,367
Really trying to help the patriots and that's the way they thought it was best to it profile the one guy telling the truth in the

1385
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
This country

1386
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
And they could save us

1387
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
Through working

1388
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
Sing with Russia

1389
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Call Trump elected

1390
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
That's probably what they would say

1391
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,839
And the fact that Alex like at this point

1392
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
In the beginning of 26

1393
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Clearly oblivious

1394
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
Because I

1395
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,983
I can kind of tell when he is

1396
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:12,639
Goodies such a bad liar.

1397
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:19,039
He seems like he's like why are all these people listening and not also buying

1398
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Restart to seize

1399
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:28,255
Search hard desperate pivot towards sales yeah I'm really ramp up the commercial

1400
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:34,655
Clothes and stuff like that

1401
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
Yep there's that

1402
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,519
Area of a circle

1403
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Them

1404
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
Then we'd be

1405
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,407
Enrolling and not realizing

1406
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Wow

1407
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,223
You do it like

1408
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
Before but you really have to give it up to the Russian

1409
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
That was a brilliant

1410
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:57,695
You don't have to give it up to them

1411
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
Give It Up

1412
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
To the I mean like

1413
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,559
One of the main reasons that it works

1414
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,119
Nobody saw it coming

1415
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Nobody saw this massive

1416
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Media landscape

1417
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,871
No

1418
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:20,223
This is one thing where America doesn't have the same

1419
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
No I don't know I have no idea but what I would say is

1420
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,415
It would work

1421
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Work

1422
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,791
I think it was a very very

1423
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,095
Good strategy and it was

1424
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:40,959
Like if you are if you're fighting a war on a battlefield that you can't win

1425
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Choose a different Battlefield

1426
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:48,383
That's all that they did know they can't do any number of propaganda things

1427
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
The same way that we

1428
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
They know they can't fight us

1429
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
Physically they know they can't do

1430
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,295
Chose the one spot where they were like

1431
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,343
Here's a flaw in this

1432
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
We can dance on this

1433
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,303
Memory as hard as we can as it was brilliant

1434
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Useful idiot

1435
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
Congratulations Alex

1436
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,167
Nicely done now let's get back to the

1437
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:19,359
There is an attack on humans

1438
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,711
A political global system eugenics

1439
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,759
Comes to kill steal and destroy

1440
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
And behave

1441

Providence

1444
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,119
Many things that are private

1445
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
I can tell you what's real

1446
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,471
I've interviewed many people are

1447
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
Expect

1448
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
10 minutes

1449

Is after they die

They're going in

1468
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Incredible

1469
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
Once you figure all this out

1470
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,591
Sacred geometry

1471
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,871

We can do

Level stop

1477
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,119
It's very

1478
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
Living and non-living

1479
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Again how

1480
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,311
We experienced what

1481
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Chepachet memories

1482
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,455
Stop same thing

1483
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,575
Who are children genetically as well not really built

1484
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
What we do lives on

1486
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,791
By the way

1487
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
By the way Infowars is doing

1488
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,447
We're not in financial trouble

1489
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
Talk radio

1490
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
And other media.

1491
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
It's stuff

1492
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Shirt

1493
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,479
It's script

1494
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,063
Starpoint

1495
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,623
In the face

1496
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
Responsibility

1497
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,255
I really try to get as big as possible

1498
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,375
What were you trying to do before

1499
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
15 to 16 million people

1500
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,407
Deaf people

1501
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
The ruins

1502
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,015
Is killing

1503
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
So I really want to be able to continue

1504
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:46,719
Infowarsstore.com

1505
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:05,151
I wanted to keep that part at the end they are in

1506
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
Because it is

1507
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:11,807
Drinking the Kool-Aid about these new listeners

1508
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
Wii maker

1509
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,159
What the f*** is going on

1510
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
He is out there

1511
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:27,935
He is out there so I've never heard I do understand

1512
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:34,335
Mechanics you'll realize that when people die for 10 minutes

1513
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:40,735
Yuma golden gates and the judgment is real but it's totally real

1514
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:46,879
Angry Birds post-death judgment that you go through is real

1515
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,695
Albert Brooks

1516
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,487
It's like the movie flatliners

1517
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:56,607
Defending Your Life it's much better movie

1518
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
I am

1519
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,799
Flabbergasted

1520
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:11,455
I f****** love it anytime somebody like him says quantum mechanics you can already tuned out

1521
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:17,855
Nope nope you got nothing back, right the pronunciation

1522
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,159
Quantum cuz you're just going to hurt yourself with that

1523
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Awesome

1524
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,767
For me it's like okay

1525
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:31,167
He starts that clip by saying the debate about the devil is over as far as I'm concerned

1526
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Okay

1527
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:40,383
Then all that stuff about you know Joseph Campbell all these cultures and

1528
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:45,759
CPR

1529
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,319
These cultures they've

1530
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
Michonne

1531
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
Judgment and all that

1532
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,439
Science has shown

1533
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
The when you die

1534
01:18:54,975 --> 01:19:01,119
Your Consciousness goes forward to the post-tribulation rapture

1535
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:08,031
You know it's real because when God said what

1536
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
16 MI

1537
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,359
He said look around

1538
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,695
And then of course it comes back to Ed's it's just like what is going on he's a losing it there's just this like

1539
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
Ratably

1540
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Like

1541
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
This

1542
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
Point

1543
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
He's soaking

1544
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Confused

1545
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,983
What what do you say to somebody saying stuff like

1546
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
Well I don't even mean about that

1547
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:46,175
You should be saying is on there that's

1548
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:52,575
Read up on sacred geometry

1549
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:58,975
Blogs about it

1550
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,327
Spiritualism and stuff like that

1551
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,143
I feel so weird about it

1552
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:12,543
But I would never tell you what I know I would never sit here and be like oh yeah

1553
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:16,640
Dudedad like list off specifics

1554
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
He needs to be less

1555
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
Specific that bilgrami

1556
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:26,624
Experiment Milgram or talk about the electric shocks or whatever

1557
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
I can't

1558
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Disprove that

1559
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
That I can disprove

1560
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,232
He's too specific here

1561
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,768
This is what crazy people do

1562
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
Island is a crazy person

1563
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,608
This isn't religion

1564
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,168
Former Department of Defense psychiatrist

1565
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,448
Who have become Christian

1566
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,568
Officially proven was probably pechanec that the Golden Gate

1567
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
I did not know that

1568
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,712
Does he has a state psychiatry

1569
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Right

1570
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,296
That's the only person I know of it that qualification

1571
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
I don't know just cuz the name

1572
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,280
Okay so does he think that the hurricane

1573
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:09,632
Through happened because I got to buy the father's Jewish cuz he lives in Florida

1574
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,448
There might be a bias on my part and I apologize for

1575
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
I don't know anything about his life

1576
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,080
Population Florida

1577
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:24,480
So let's in this one Alex is talking about how the Chinese have

1578
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,528
I decided they're going to start a new program

1579
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
Where they have

1580
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
People do the golden

1581
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:35,232
Smoke now. Quite they have a Facebook

1582
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,536
People and you'll get a social credit score

1583
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:44,192
It was an idea that they were throwing around I don't think

1584
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Great Black Mirror

1585
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
Basically

1586
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,848
When the next two years

1587
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
2016

1588
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:56,736
Political

1589
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
Possible

1590
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
Social media

1591
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,024
Social credit score

1592
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,656
Before he gets through not a good global

1593
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,240
Can't buy or sell mark of the beast

1594
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
Before he gets into talking about how like everyone go

1595
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
Going to do this and they're going to think

1596
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
It's cool

1597
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,456
They had a one-child policy for a really long time

1598
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Salt Lake

1599
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,320
Works perfectly and everybody

1600
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,112
Oppressiveness in chili kit

1601
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:38,464
China this is not surprising to come of these ideas

1602
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,512
Be coming out of a pretty authoritarian state

1603
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,536
Doesn't

1604
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,840
The restaurant is not going to be

1605
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
No

1606
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Good episode

1607
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,264
If you do you get lower prices

1608
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
Now it's pure pressure

1609
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,384
How is your friends aren't good communist

1610
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,200
You don't get a good social score

1611
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,248
So now you stun them together

1612
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
BBC China social credit

1613
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
What he's describing is the current credit system we have now and it's only it's only incredibly offensive to Black

1614
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,216
People in minorities and end the life

1615
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:32,480
There's a threat of that

1616
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,040
What is only hurts minorities

1617
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:38,880
The other something to that let's get together this club cuz it takes a Twist you're not going

1618
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,952
What's described in Revelations

1619
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
Whether or not

1620
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
Cosmology

1621
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Selfish truth

1622
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,264
But I don't want to be associated with the establishment

1623
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
Pharisee

1624
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,848
State-run churches that are 501 c 3

1625
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
Now even got it right to their credit

1626
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
Does chilling plan

1627
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
Do you social credit rating

1628
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,368
Human soul

1629
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,416
Sometimes I tell the truth and amazing

1630
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
Sup

1631
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,984
So now he also knows that

1632
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,384
Yeah either where of that knows that Artie is run by the FSB

1633
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:42,112
Purple

1634
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,928
CIA agents tell it they're not good at running

1635
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,976
They do but different job

1636
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,280
With the contact that they

1637
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Indicate

1638
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:56,704
A clear awareness that Alex knows that Artie is run by Russia

1639
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,008
Outlet

1640
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:05,408
For propaganda last episode

1641
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,736
A bunch of times.

1642
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
What does that say Alec

1643
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,344
What does that say

1644
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
You dumbass

1645
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,904
Dumb dumb

1646
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,720
Prick he's like he's like

1647
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,512
Movie Avatar

1648
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,840
Like

1649
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,400
Come to us from the cognitive dissonance

1650
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,424
Planet

1651
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,008
In the same way that Jon Hamm

1652
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
Is an alien who

1653
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,056
Stardust what true hands

1654
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
This really is

1655
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,896
So is Alex teaching as what true cognitive

1656
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Can do to a purse

1657
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:41,760
It just baffles me the way that he reveals

1658
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
These things

1659
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
Like

1660
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,112
He thinks it all make

1661
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:52,000
Since it's a wife wouldn't tell it to you

1662
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:57,376
That's that mild schizophrenia the ordered worldview that he has

1663
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
Luso

1664
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,496
Worked everything

1665
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,032
Despite the fact that it contradicts

1666
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Itself at every turn

1667
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:11,968
MC and this is the other stuff where we're talking about him being a performance artist

1668
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,784
But this is he actually believes

1669
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,184
Yes this is real shity beliefs tribulation Rapture that your brain goes to

1670
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
Do when you die

1671
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,512
If you die before the tribulation

1672
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,072
Yeah it may this is not like

1673
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
This isn't

1674
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
In the strictest sense this isn't

1675
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Propaganda

1676
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
This is why this is a lute

1677
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:40,896
Is what it is this is what we've all thought Alex Jones

1678
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,968
For the longest time it's f***** up is it like he can have

1679
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,016
That half of his audience that are robots

1680
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,648
Are there like this

1681
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
Just fun

1682
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:56,256
That's true actually I've been working on it.

1683
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,816
I think that I don't believe

1684
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
You can find Alex Jones

1685
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,400
Funny unless you subconsciously agree with him

1686
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,472
I don't I don't believe nothing

1687
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,776
Possibility

1688
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:10,848
Some people

1689
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Former AJ's

1690
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,944
I know people who are like

1691
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,736
Island

1692
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,064
F****** hilarious man

1693
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,416
Or you agree with him and you don't want to admit you agree with him because then

1694
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Do you look like

1695
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,768
Oh really you want this

1696
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,816
Everyone knows that's too hard you don't f******

1697
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,864
I Love Lucy I think

1698
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,656
It's hilarious when Alex Jones

1699
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,192
In flames

1700
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,472
Anti-semitism

1701
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:41,056
And everybody but white people believe

1702
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
I think it's hilarious

1703
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,152
All the time we do laugh a s*** ton of

1704
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:50,272
Colors that but it's in a different we laugh a different laugh

1705
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
1 filter

1706
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,904
Rage revelation of what

1707
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
Actually talking about

1708
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
Back to the Rapture being

1709
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
A handle

1710
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
Text clip

1711
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Enjoy

1712
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
You can read

1713
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,080
John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos

1714
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,176
The Beach Boys war against the Saints and will overcome they'll be there

1715
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,760
Great falling away before with greatest

1716
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,040
The God ever

1717
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:27,648
The whole world turns against the baseboard more

1718
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,184
Population

1719
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,560
Columns of flame

1720
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
Mountains

1721
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,144
Huge metal insects

1722
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,776
Huge wall

1723
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,592
Russia and the Middle East huge compensation

1724
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
That's what they called

1725
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:53,760
Themselves

1726
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,064
Then Christ comes back

1727
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,280
Five-year-old

1728
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,328
But yourself

1729
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
That's true

1730
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,424
Because the last year the World Council of churches

1731
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,704
Globalized

1732
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
Christian faith

1733
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:17,824
Dogmas that were not known in Christianity ever

1734
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
In the forties

1735
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,664
Christian didn't resist Hitler

1736
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Thought

1737
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,224
It was the end of the world they thought he was

1738
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
In the 27th

1739
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,320
American Christians

1740
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,088
Didn't resist

1741
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,672
Hitler supported

1742
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,256
And your preachers wrong

1743
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,584
Pre-tribulation Rapture I'm not saying he's a false teacher

1744
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,168
You are

1745
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,176
Fair enough

1746
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
But yes

1747
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:02,880
I mean it's imaginary arguments to argue against your argument is probably right

1748
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,952
Weird for us to sit here and have him

1749
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
Be like the post

1750
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
Versus pre-tribulation Rapture I don't care

1751
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:19,776
Why are we doing it I think what we're doing is a weenie

1752
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,824
It's important that our audience

1753
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,152
Knows that he spends a lot of time on stuff like that right

1754
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,432
Because it is like

1755
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,968
There is way too much

1756
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
Super Focus

1757
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,504
In the manger

1758
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,320
Stream I believe the coverage of Alex Jones on

1759
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:36,160
I mean there are important issues the is hucksterism is is

1760
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,720
Desperate salesmanship and rap

1761
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
It support of trump

1762
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
Those are two things are important

1763
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
It's to him but he's religion

1764
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,936
Which is not Christianity

1765
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,008
Big picture of who he is

1766
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,312
As a broadcaster

1767
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Right

1768
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,712
Sunday show man

1769
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
It's not that we're like

1770
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,464
Alex blazing post-trib let's just for the pre-trip for fun

1771
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,768
What cuz it's f****** Wild

1772
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,840
So now I'll do want you to argue for the pre-trip

1773
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,680
Course heaven before

1774
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:24,288
That was a lot of fun

1775
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,848
That's very that's a very dickish God

1776
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,384
They'll be like

1777
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,712
Why would God put anybody through any

1778
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
5 to make them

1779
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:33,760
Stronger

1780
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,088
Walmart clip here Alex

1781
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,136
Is bucket like in this clip I think

1782
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,672
We get the revelation

1783
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,952
That

1784
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
I got it

1785
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,144
This whole day's show

1786
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:55,520
Okay we're all of this comes

1787
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:01,152
From this day of just rambling about the the Revelation tribulation and what have you

1788
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,432
Think it's because someone

1789
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,456
Bothering him

1790
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:06,272
And then he Rambles on for a while about

1791
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,160
I'm not on some high horse but if I get lectured one more time

1792
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,584
Miles French

1793
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:26,240
So real and files

1794
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,944
I know my heart's right where's yours

1795
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,576
Icpj

1796
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:44,160
I don't know where

1797
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,464
You know what you're doing

1798
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,792
Almost

1799
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
Midwest by Concha

1800
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,592
Even studying the enemy

1801
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,152
I wonder why that is

1802
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,760
I just saw the great evil is upon us

1803
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,552
254 the decades coming forward

1804
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:15,392
Get maybe 50 years 100

1805
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:19,744
Tommy's

1806
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,072
We could get a reprieve

1807
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,544
But because Jonah didn't want to go

1808
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
Seems very arbitrary

1809
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,576
Archaeology

1810
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:54,048
Archaeology shows in haven't approved Jonah was in awhile and have

1811
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,096
God gave them 100-year rest

1812
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:02,496
What's this doing in the fossil record

1813
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,568
The reason that this is important

1814
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
I left

1815
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,664
Blue kind of rambling and nonsensical but

1816
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,992
This is the beginning of a narrative that will be

1817
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
Become very important

1818
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
In his support of trump

1819
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,368
Let me so you could argue that this is a softball

1820
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,904
I got some ways

1821
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,952
This idea of a reprieve

1822
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Like Nineveh

1823
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
He uses those

1824
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,792
Pacific languages

1825
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
About Trump

1826
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,376
Trump is that reprieve

1827
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,424
Has God given us a

1828
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,240
To get out from under these globulus

1829
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,264
Got you

1830
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,568
Get further makes it more robust

1831
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
Extended metaphor

1832
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:42,688
That what Trump is allowing us to do is get our head above water and take a breath

1833
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:44,224
Before we have to go and fight this

1834
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Shark I guess

1835
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:51,648
I'm not entirely sure where works in the metaphor this is the first time that he has used that metaphor

1836
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
In the contacts

1837
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,744
Like the globalist and what we are

1838
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,352
Right we're doing moving forward and he will co-opt it from this religious

1839
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
Perspective

1840
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,168
Entrepreneur

1841
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,520
People God's sure are we

1842
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,616
If they appreciate this

1843
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,640
Status

1844
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,224
That's a God who who's not paying attention

1845
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,040
That's a God who checked out

1846
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:23,904
I'll tell you that right now it's not buying caveman

1847
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,536
That's where all the ad that's what the traffic coming from. Didn't have any dollars

1848
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:32,352
God's God got his own holy Bop Farm

1849
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,592
Bought

1850
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:48,480
He knows that Artie is a propaganda outlet and it showed bickering about the revelation

1851
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,784
And our various forms of the rapture

1852
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,648
And doing that whole game where he's like a if you believe in a pre-tribulation

1853
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,672
Preachers not

1854
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:03,072
Nesco was involved

1855
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:09,472
I want

1856
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,544
They sound a lot like collaborators to me

1857
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:17,664
Pick a side if you're Pizarro nonsense

1858
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,200
God I want it

1859
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,480
See now I want him

1860
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,296
I just quit Broadcasting

1861

Write your own holy book

1862

You get a look at f****** Joseph Smith can get a worldwide religion f*** you Alex Jones in ism

1863
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,072
People would do that s***

1864
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:39,936
I just don't think you could write a coherent thread I think you need a Ghostwriter

1865
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,216
Alex

1866
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,776

1883
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
One other guy believes in

1884
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,632

01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
Ice-T

01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,056

01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,248
Oh s*** now think about this

1893
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
The teeth

1894
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296

Bits of depression he's knocked out all of his teeth and that's why he needs dentures

01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:12,096

How do you live forever

1903
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
You download your consciousness

01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,640
Into some faulty Trace memory

1905
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Exact

1906
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,712
And then implant those teeth

1907
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,272
Into John rapping

1908
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,856
