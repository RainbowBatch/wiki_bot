Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,720
Everybody

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,048
Zariah likes around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,936
Jones Jordan Jordan

00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Los Tres

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,288
Late but has there ever been a musician whose death

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
Got to I can't

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Ask question because I'm realizing

11
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
As I say Jordan

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
Oka discontinued say Jordana Brewster

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
Who is in Fast & Furious

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
I got lost In Fun

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Characters the fastest

16
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Fury

17
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,120
Two together Paul Walker's character dies cuz he passed away tragically

18
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
That was pretty emotional at was back to your original question

19
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
I guess maybe 0db

20
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah yeah probably hit me pretty hard

21
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Amaris probably what

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,784
2021 somewhere around there when he passed and you know the last two years of his life were very sad

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
The end

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
You know he was

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
The instrumental part of

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,512
Me liking the Wu-Tang Clan I really appreciated his

27
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
His aunt

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Perspective

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
I don't know if it's probably not a great dancer but that is I didn't get

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Heading to Wu-Tang until after OD

31
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
I grew up in middle of nowhere

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Small town where everybody was like

33
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Rap music is

34
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
It wasn't until I left that

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
I was like oh that's right Wu-Tang

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
Yeah

37
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
I'm trying to wreck my of course obviously there are people like Bowie or

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,632
You know I definitely appreciate

39
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
Wasn't as much of an emotional connection is is per se like

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
My youth

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Andrew

42
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,408
The chaoticness of his character and I mean granted his real life

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Really matched a lot of

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
The feelings that I had as a younger person

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
The explicit drug use test early or B

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Surdyke service

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,816
Circumstances of life or the old dirty moniker

48
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Things that I could connect to and

49
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Seeing

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Yeah I'm dying

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Yeah yeah

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Alright well

53
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
That's my answer well I just realized with dying cuz that died

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,016
Hobart

55
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Kind of serious sir

56
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
But I just realized that we're in the decade now where every major Rockstar from the seventies is it

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
Yeah and I think that we've been in that for a good bit now

58
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
The 70s hits

59
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
50 years exactly from then they all they were all the 2025 when they did it now they're all going to stay

60
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Start dropping like flies

61
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah yeah that is probably true

62
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,248
And forever like Paula White Cain

63
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
Is great above a lot of their work

64
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,303
Is a little bit silly like the trees

65
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
Susie was a great great great Lyricist and

66
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Sad

67
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Interesting character

68
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
Rest in peace Neil Peart

69
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Playing with Buddy Rich

70
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Shut up

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
Stupid ass B everyone does their

72
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
I don't like that kinda

73
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Hubert but I do love

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Appreciate

75
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
I know a lot about Alex jobs

76
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,119
We are I don't like that kind of humor either and I don't know anything about Alex yet

77
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
Sweet I'm so George today we need to take a break from the

78
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
Because it's just been too much we've been

79
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
We're on like three straight weeks

80
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
No cuz we have that Bill Cooper episode next day

81
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
But it's been a lot of present-day

82
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Especially lately it's just beginning overwhelming

83
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
Weatherby Steve pieczenik coming on and denying the Holocaust

84
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Alex doing

85
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
Just outrageously islamophobic

86
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
Breakdown of an episode

87
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Hey Jessie got a you got to step back a little bit

88
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,887
I wanted the things that I realized is that in the wake of

89
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
All of this stuff happening

90
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
In the present-day what are the things

91
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
That we really let slip

92
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Is the 2013 Sandy Hook investigation

93
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,431
Sure and I know that you and I've had conversations not on the show about

94
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
The feeling that like this is going to go on forever

95
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
We are going

96
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,623
To just keep going and Alex is going to stay in this wishy-washy state where he's

97
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Basically saying that there are actors

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
But not committing to it fully

99
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Right

100
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,351
Is probably not great for us or the show

101
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
It doesn't really lead us to where we want to go

102
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
Ultimately I said out doing that investigation

103
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Starting on the day of the Sandy Hook shooting

104
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
And moving forward

105
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
Because I wanted to know what was the

106
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Zach day

107
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,783
That Alex started saying that no one died there they were just actors

108
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
And all of that

109
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
And like 5 months later we

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
We still don't have the

111
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Exactly

112
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,487
No but I've also realized in the process of doing it that the question that I was asking doesn't

113
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,583
Right through I felt like there was some Merit

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
To knowing that again

115
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
Exact

116
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Going to go through that Haystack.

117
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Find the needle

118
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
And in doing so I realized that the haystack is mostly needles

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
Yeah that metaphor

120
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
You realize that even if Alex is it

121
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Babe

122
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Do you know

123
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Definitively these people are actor

124
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,999
Yeah he is justifying suspicion that there actors by saying that people

125
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,839
Who died or survived the Aurora shooting

126
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
So

127
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Though he's not

128
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,727
Directly impugning the experience of these people in Connecticut

129
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
People who died at the Aurora shooting

130
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
We're Someone's Child 2

131
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
Right people who died at the Aurora shooting where other

132
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
People's loved ones

133
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
He's committing the exact

134
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
Text same behavior in relation to another shooting

135
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
In order to justify

136
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Suspicion of this shoe

137
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
So long as words have meeting

138
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
And literary devices

139
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Is R-Truth

140
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
He is functionally said

141
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
Exactly what we were expecting for some reason

142
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
He's not willing

143
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
2

144
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Make that leap

145
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
As it relates

146
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
The Sandy Hook

147
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
At that point ultimately meaning

148
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
The same

149
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Disgusting Behavior

150
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Already absolutely

151
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
So

152
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Don't care

153
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Alright

154
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
Don't along the way it is great

155
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Good that we were able to

156
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
To find the time of the Boston bombing

157
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,975
And I think that was probably one of the most Illuminating things for me

158
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,559
Researching Alex

159
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Conspiracy in realty

160
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
Time adjusting to information

161
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
Crafting things out of thin air

162
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
Pretending that the world is

163
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Acting in response

164
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
And whatever he's saying oh now they got to adjust the right hand

165
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
That kind of thing was really really fascinating

166
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
And I'm glad that we were able to

167
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Find that

168
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,391
Not necessarily accidentally but along the way of doing the Sandy Hook investigation

169
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Yeah I think those

170
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
A few days were probably some of the most

171
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,559
Exhilarating episode that he's ever like the way that I react

172
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
To them seeing him create those

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Conspiracy theories in real

174
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,215
Time you could feel

175
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Add so

176
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
I want

177
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
2 a.m.

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
The investigate

179
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Quite frankly

180
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
I know it's a little bit unsatisfying inasmuch as

181
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
We don't

182
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Have

183
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
The specific

184
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Day

185
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
But I also

186
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
I just think

187
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
But we will be doing this

188
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Committing to

189
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
This

190

He shows up as a leading school safety security expert

210
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
He has his theories but Alex isn't really all of that like

211
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Fully willing to

212
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
To jump along with

213
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
I don't believe I believe that some people died

215
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479

228
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151

234
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231

Let's do it

297
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
So here's that Alex is talking about some other kind of news

298
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
You planning to cover on this

299
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,799
Last night

300
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,383
What am I going to cover not because there isn't a lot of news

301
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
There is just too much of it and it's all just gets crazier

302
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
And crazier and more interesting by the minute

303
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
Well. It's been discovered found after 500 years of the wreck

304
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
The Christopher Columbus Flagship Santa Maria

305
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
That's the type of news going to be talkin about here today

306
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
From the Chippewa down with the big lake they called

307
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263

308
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
The lake it said no giveaway for today

309
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Skies of November turn blue

310
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,831
With a load of iron ore 26000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald

311
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Used to be a karaoke song am I

312
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,095
Alright I had long instrumental break so I could just yell at the audio

313
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Totally

314
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
That's awful

315
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
And it's depressing

316
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Oh it's real sad

317
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
Is there a Roadhouse karaoke bar one time with Nick

318
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Icaregifts

319
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Naked gifts

320
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
And we I was singing The Wreck of the Edmund

321
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,783
And an instrumental breaks I would often proposed social

322
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
Raise my glass good many women went down on my boat

323
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
Brick

324
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,911
So what I was doing that at this karaoke bar and this lady was in a wheelchair was screaming at me

325
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
What do you know about good man

326
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
Alright alright that's

327
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
That's pretty fantastic

328
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
Text Jennifer point I was I was being a prick

329
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Anyway

330
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
Alex announces that he's got Wolfgang halbig on the show and I would say that based on those eyes

331
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
That he's giving off

332
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
He seems like he's okay with how big's.

333
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Eastpointe and consistently

334
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
How big

335
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Point has been

336
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
No one died

337
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Is all fake

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
And Alex seems fine with

339
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
Guest joining us Wolfgang

340
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
How big Pharma state police officer

341
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
Runs one of the largest school training safety

342
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,527
The organization said the countries also Middle School principal

343
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Address of the state police

344
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
And I was Florida

345
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
I'm at the whole point is that

346
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
He's under investigation he says looks like Sandy looks totally staged

347
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
And we know they've declared State secrets on it bulldoze the school

348
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
He win

349
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,239
And I actually turn the cameras off

350
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,311
I speak even a lot of time she'll there acting very

351
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Very

352
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Very

353
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Very suspicious

354
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
No they will pull anything off

355
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
We're going to get an update from him

356
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
So we've got like this

357
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
Rationalization if he'll pull off all these other things

358
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
They certainly do this

359
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Sure he gives for various

360
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Suspicious

361
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Qualifies

362
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,751
Is very very very very suspicious 85% more suspicious than

363
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Just one very or like what are we dealing with

364
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
I mean is it a logarithmic

365
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
At this point

366
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
How big is a non Quan

367
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,271
He's a known entity

368
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,879
Connecticut guys all about

369
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
Board meeting would not be interested engaging with him

370
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Is not

371
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Suspicious

372
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
It is almost

373
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,863
The most predictable and absolutely correct

374
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Move for them

375
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
So he

376
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Alex talks more about how big going to this press conference

377
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
And he seems to take great issue with the fact

378
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
An article

379
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
I believe discovery

380
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
Call Wolfgang halbig a conspiracy

381
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Galaxy YouTube

382
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
To take

383
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Offense

384
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
At this

385
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
National news

386
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
They shut down that school board meetings will report that article as well

387
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
And I get to that

388
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
Is that line Newtown school board shuts down

389
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,423
Conspiracy theorist discovery.com

390
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
If you don't believe known certified Liars

391
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
Any question Obama saying

392
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
There is no $5,000 fee per employee

393
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Who doesn't get ObamaCare

394
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
Kicking in in 2015

395
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
And many businesses in 2014

396
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,927
If you don't believe Obama when he says a bald-faced lie you're a conspiracy theorist

397
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Speeches you didn't build your small business

398
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
He says raising the debt limit doesn't raise the national debt

399
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
You say it does raise the national debt your conspiracy theories

400
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
If you say table of 2 equals

401
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
You're a guitarist

402
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,919
Thought you said that birds fly in the ducks quack your conspiracy dinner team more examples

403
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
The exact same thing he's really

404
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Pounding

405
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah it's pretty clear

406
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
So I mean if you take what he's

407
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Clearly expressing their AIDS

408
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
There

409
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
How big is talking

410
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Pure truth

411
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Conspiracy theories

412
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,655
How big does 2 plus 2 equals 4

413
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
The only

414
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Conclusion you can draw is

415
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
You also the

416
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:55,103
In this case we know what that is a stand-in for that is

417
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Right

418
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
So it's it seems to be every

419
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,735
Everything in Alex's presentation in the

420
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Teasing of this interview that's coming up easement

421
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
2

422
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Without it

423
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Explicitly saying

424
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
I believe the same thing he does

425
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
It's to say

426
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
Are you right

427
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Yeah with the upward everything he says has the tiny little upward inflection at the end so you're like wait is that a statement or question what are you

428
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
You doing here

429
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
You know and I know

430
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Something interesting

431
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
What's going on on this episode here in 2014

432
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
That it was absent

433
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
From when we were looking

434
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Stephen 2013

435
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
And that is Alex does a bit of infomercial and

436
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Oh really coz.

437
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
The group is around house

438
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
He's not on the show but he has arrived

439
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Okay Alex

440
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Is now selling his brother

441
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
I cannot stress

442
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Do you

443
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,815
The fact that I'm under more stress than I've ever been under

444
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
And I'm performing better under that stress than I've ever done

445
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
And it's undoubtedly and I'll tell the story now

446
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Is it selling for

447
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
I ran six miles every other day

448
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
I

449
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
Lifted weights every other day

450
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Very important and I ate like a pig

451
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
I drank as much beer as I wanted to

452
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
1822

453
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Went out with the bodies went out

454
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
To Stephen all that

455
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Why did you need

456
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
You tell me my weekends

457
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
And

458
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
Look like

459
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
Mr. universe or something

460
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,527
Dedicated

461
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
I just around that long I might as well just quit working out and just work eighteen hours a day many days for years I will take

462
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
18 hours a day

463
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
Put olive film

464
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
Building on media organization everything

465
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,935
And it worked okay the first two years or so the metabolism slow down I gained 60 lbs

466
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Now I look like Greg

467
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
I went up from about 180 lb

468
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,175
About 240 lb

469
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
2275

470
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Is the biggest I've ever been

471
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
75

472
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
I was about 275 about 56 years ago

473
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
But pretty good for 275

474
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Didn't need to say that down to 230 lb

475
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Here's the thing about five years ago I started working out

476
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
Swimming 2 miles a day several days a week

477
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
2 mi open swim

478
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
Began doing 567 mile hikes

479
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
Stop clicking stuff but didn't really change my diet as much as I should

480
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Organic

481
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
And didn't lose what about 10 lb

482
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
Then I did some of the Infowars health.com youngevity stuff

483
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Sr 25 lb or so

484
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
But when I got the super male Vitality developed by doctor gribbin

485
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
I've lost another

486
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
20 lb

487
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,432
And I have more energy

488
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
By his own telling of this long

489
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Infomercial pitch

490
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
The youngevity products works better

491
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,952
Seems like put the numbers in 2520 I don't know I've no

492
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,536
Dietitian nutritionist. I don't know but that mean the numbers

493
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,936
Right I don't know what it is it easier to lose 25 lb when your 375/20 when your 350

494
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
I told you I'm not an expert in anything you need to find out

495
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Look the issue here is that

496
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
The show is becoming more of this

497
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,128
There is more it and it's

498
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,712
Noticeable if you jump from the 2013 to do this

499
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
And it's

500
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
The incorporation of the

501
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
These products

502
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Migraine today

503
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Time back when you were looking at the

504
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
2013 error there would be

505
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Times when the entire fourth hour

506
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,256
Or when you go into overdrive would be like one of those

507
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,632
Youngevity weirdo by

508
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
Some of their their product

509
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Teen Vogue

510
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
It's not totally for it

511
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
To his program

512
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
But there's more

513
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
There's more of it

514
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
It's noticeable

515
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Yeah so you got this

516
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
Vibe going I find his

517
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
General tone and demeanor

518
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
While telling us

519
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
New Superman Vitality to be hilarious and

520
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
In the context of

521
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
What super male Vitality did to him

522
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
That we've seen five years later the ex got a long cogent story with one story line boring boring

523
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Finish it but it's all about the

524
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
Same thing you got your good point that is a great point

525
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
It's all about the

526
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,920
Same thing as dull as that story was and how many times I thought

527
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,272
Denis daily

528
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
I left all this it is because

529
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
Full story does lead to be

530
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
That's a phenomenon that we rarely get any more

531
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
Man that's s*** f*** you up

532
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
Stay off supermale

533
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,192
So Alex is doing a bit of teasing

534
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Throughout the show about how he's going

535
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Interview Wolfgang

536
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
How big

537
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
And

538
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
I think if you listen to this you can kind of hear him talking

539
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Himself into

540
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
How big is positions

541
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,720
State police officer that runs one of the largest most successful school safety

542
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,560
Training organizations

543
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,424
Sandy Hook I know it's

544
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
Flaming was there I just don't know exactly what they say

545
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
You know the stories

546
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
Top experts Disgaea

547
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
Even threatened by the FBI at his house

548
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
Now barred from being able to ask questions at school board

549
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
I mean they are really and you can see him with the kids going in circles

550
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Going in and out on helicopter shot

551
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Looks like a drill

552
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
They might have killed a few real kids in there I don't know

553
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,936
But we know they're having a drill we know they had weird SWAT teams dressed up like the shooters there

554
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
Government connections to the

555
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640
Colorado shooter ladies and gentlemen

556
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,712
Our record was under a top military psychiatrist

557
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
I don't even have time to get into it it's coming up I mean

558
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,880
Okay and and they're doing this to come after I got

559
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,000
So I mean you can you can hear that that's basically him repeating some of the things

560
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
But he's comfortable with

561
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah it's touchdown seems comfortable with and it leads to him talk

562
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Be able to talk

563
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Midstate

564
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Sticker gun

565
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
So he's

566
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
He's just chipping away at what it is

567
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
He will say

568
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
He's already he's at the point where he's like yes it's staged

569
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
It's just a matter of

570
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Scale

571
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,528
Did they say everything or did they say stage just the Anderson Cooper interview

572
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
What all was

573
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,392
East is chipping away at whatever the resiliency has to jumping off a

574
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Right

575
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
To Alex

576
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,584
Starts Meandering a little bit about how there's a slippery slope of political correctness

577
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Going on

578
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Immoral

579
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
It's running

580
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
And this leads into him

581
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
Talkin about

582
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Soros

583
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Is a Nazi collaborator

584
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Great so he's on that point

585
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Here by May 24th

586
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
But what's interesting

587
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
It's less of that

588
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
Although it is fairly in

589
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,088
What's more interesting is that in talking about that

590
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
He has a Counterpoint

591
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Of someone else

592
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Who's cool

593
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
But everyone thinks it's bad

594
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
Let's get Chinese food nearby

595
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,936
If you don't call it the Orient you call it Asia

596
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,752
You don't call it Asia you call it the east

597
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
You don't you don't say

598
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,176
African-American now you say this it's just all please you

599
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
Will you turn your

600
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,416
Can you give money

601
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Okay

602
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
Do you also

603
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Are Nazi collaborator

604
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,656
Like George Soros the famous one and then you get awards from ATL

605
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240
Even if you fight the Nazis

606
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,104
And the government will send white-supremacist our government controlled after you of your Alex Jones

607
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
Reply you're racist

608
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,784
Dwight supremacist after you were proving to be government agents

609
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
Arnold Schwarzenegger

610
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672
Belts Nazi Dalton said that he loves Hitler

611
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
But

612
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
But if you make a movie about Christ

613
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
And make one comment your baited into

614
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Hellboy

615
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
School

616
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
So we're defending Mel Gibson

617
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,808
That's where we got from all of this kind of galaxy

618
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
So yeah

619
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
He was baited into it you're a Nazi because your dad has a whole weird anti-semitic thing that you

620
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
You bought into clearly for

621
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
For 30-plus years

622
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,120
And all the sudden you say it out loud one time and who played it

623
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Repeat it

624
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
And it's all because you made a movie about Christ

625
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Great

626
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
So Alex leads into is interviewed here with how they

627
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
I'm just going to I'm skipping a lot of

628
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Episode

629
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
It is

630
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
More like that story

631
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
It is not great

632
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
She gets into the

633
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,648
Interview by listing off a bunch of

634
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Quote unquote

635
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
Inconsistency

636
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
About the Sandy Hook story

637
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
It's important to point out that these are not just in

638
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
Consistency

639
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
But he's listing that are like

640
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Hey here's some questions

641
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
And smokes have

642
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
These are Wolfgang halbig talkingpoi

643
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
He's saying that this is exact

644
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Likely what happened.

645
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Maybe this

646
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
No

647
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Enzo in leading into his interview he's doing

648
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,760
Some Lifting for Wolfgang already

649
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,624
Ladies and gentlemen we have massive breaking news here

650
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
Dealing with the first amendment in this country

651
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,304
If you look at the situation in Connecticut with the Sandy Hook shooting

652
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,144
That were used to collectively put guilt on the American people

653
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,960
Gun owners collectively had murdered

654
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,312
A bunch of little children Elementary School you can see it was a psyop

655
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,152
Come out that Bloomberg put out emails the day before

656
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Get ready with our Twitter with our media

657
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
Have a big push against the next 24 hours

658
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Very suspicious

659
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,184
Then you got the local or Regional SWAT team people hiding out in the woods

660
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
In the same outfits as opposed to Shooter

661
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,840
You got the whole story changing the most incriminating as you got the helicopter footage

662
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,192
Of the of the people with their hands up coming out of school

663
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,752
Emilia in the evacuation

664
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Hours Everett supposed to be happening

665
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
Going in circles in and out of the school

666
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,688
Going in circles

667
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Declared State secrets

668
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
The photos the video

669
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:20,160
There's weird Anderson Cooper video where he claims he's there on the ground of the Town Square in

670
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
He turns bigger than Dallas and it's a green screen

671
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
He's shimmering around the edges his nose disappear

672
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
You can see

673
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,496
Flowers and things blowing in the wind and then they do it again it's the same footage being looked behind them

674
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
I mean

675
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
I don't know what happened there

676
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,224
But I know Anderson Cooper's admittedly member of the Central Intelligence Agency

677
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
And they send him out on the dicenzo pieces

678
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,672
All this stuff is these things that now Alex is like wow

679
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
Yeah I mean of course it's not a blue screen

680
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Of course

681
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
You know when

682
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Confronted with like

683
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
What is this footage

684
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
You say it's people walking

685
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
The students walking in circular

686
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Well yeah I guess it's not

687
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
Like all of these things are things that he's now just

688
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Of course

689
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Not standing by

690
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Very serious and very proven

691
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
I'm here in May 2014

692
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Macy's leading into this interview

693
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Anza

694
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,440
I mean it's that I mean yeah sure he said he was he was just having debates while saying that

695
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,536
Very true

696
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Thing that happened

697
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Yeah

698
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
And the other thing that he's doing in addition to

699
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Establishing

700
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
The talking points of Wolfgang halbig before actually getting into the interview which

701
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
I mean that gives

702
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Him a cakewalk basically

703
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
For this interview

704
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
He also Alex does

705
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
He goes out of his way

706
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
To establish

707
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Credibility

708
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Wolfgang

709
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
In order to frame this interview as

710
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
An Intrepid

711
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Investigator going out to dig out the

712
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Truth

713
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
As opposed to it being like well

714
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
This guy has questions

715
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
Is there validity to them

716
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
That's not what he's doing

717
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
He's presenting him as a

718
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
The hero

719
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,008
He's not a kooky guy

720
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
Him asking questions last year

721
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
Just lost a lot of business for the system

722
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
But he doesn't care

723
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
I'm guessing

724
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
I know how the system works I don't know that I'll ask him out a minute

725
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
Buddy's exact

726
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
Who goes against his own interest

727
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
Monetarily

728
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
To go out and tell the truth now here's the bombshell news

729
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,912
This is Jen discovery.com

730
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
That's people that don't believe the official story

731
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
So that's

732
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:50,176
Let me we got it again he's not he's just doesn't believe the stories of true known liars and just ask question

733
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,504
Wolfgang halbig and his crew were not just asking

734
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,832
Questions at that Newtown school board meeting in May 2014

735
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
They were going there as part of a rally for their Sandy Hook

736
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Conspiracy not

737
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
An article in the Connecticut Post

738
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Describes the sort of behavior

739
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
He was engaged

740
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
Quote

741
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,424
A half-hour before the meeting started how big's followers rallied in front of the municipal center

742
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,032
What man dressed as in a revolutionary war-era uniform wave to Hanging f

743
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
Fuji of Governor dannel Malloy

744
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
That's the sort of s*** they were doing

745
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,712
That doesn't sound exactly like just asking

746
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
I feel like asking questions is a maybe just one step below hanging things in effigy

747
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
Yeah so at me even then it's it's a close

748
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Close

749
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
It's still not there

750
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,888
The day prior they drop by the offices of the United Way of Western Connecticut demanding records of how charity fund

751
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
When's the donations

752
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
Only to be told that all that information is already public

753
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:51,360
They don't need to ask for it I can just go find it very easily

754
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
It it look me in the eyes when you lie to me

755
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Interesting leave that article goes on to say quote

756
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Seven members of the group

757
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Some carrying

758
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Still in video cameras

759
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Then visited the offices of the news-times

760
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
Asking to meet with a reporter

761
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,280
A news-times editor met with one member of the group who asked for a story about their visit

762
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
To the United Way

763
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
But the request was denied

764
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
These people were engaged in a publicity

765
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
Restocked and their Acts

766
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Pretty well spell that out

767
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
There's really no other explanation

768
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,592
For asking the newspaper to write an article about how you went to the United Way demanding records you can

769
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Easily find online

770
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
The same could be said of how big the pier into the board

771
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
The Connecticut Post describes his group of being about a dozen or so people who each got three minutes to ask questions before

772
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
They didn't get what they wanted out of the meeting

773
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
Quote board members refused to take the bait

774
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Remaining silent

775
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Through presentations by how big

776
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,840
Taken several of his supporters

777
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Who followed him to the micro

778
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
The Connecticut Post describes the audience as quote

779
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Paxful but thoroughly discussed

780
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,872
The reality is that this was a mentally unwell man trying to pull off an explosive poop list

781
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Restart along with a small group of follow

782
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Look for someone like Alex

783
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
This is suspicious

784
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
This is stonewalling

785
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
And probably evidence

786
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
The cover-up going on

787
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
According to the New York Magazine after the school board meeting

788
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,000
Lenny Pozner emailed how big request

789
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Into talk

790
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
An associate sent a reply saying quote

791
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,424
Wolfgang does not wish to speak with you unless you exhume Noah's body

792
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
And prove to the world you lost your son

793
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
These are sick

794
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
F****** people were talking to

795
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
No

796
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
Yeah I mean I can appropriate response to say to that

797
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Note

798
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Go away for good

799
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Also

800
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
An important point to bring up is that on May 9th

801
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
2014

802
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
Infowars released a special report

803
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Recorded in Newtown

804
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,352
The video was Infowars reporter Danville.

805
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Also known as the Kraken

806
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Interviewing Wolfgang halbig

807
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Make outside the school board meet

808
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,360
It's unclear if the video they show of Wolfgang addressing the board was actually shot by badonde himself

809
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
But it's presented with an a

810
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Infowars watermark

811
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Emma Campbell work

812
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Is not good

813
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
So it seems like

814
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
This is an important

815
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Point

816
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Wolfgang how big was trying to drum up publicity

817
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
He and his group tried to get the news-times

818
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
To cover their activities that no one took

819
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:20,352
Debate he tried to antagonize the school board members and they only gave him respectfully silent discussed

820
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,680
But Infowars was not only happy to cover his filthy s***

821
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
They were there

822
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Without him

823
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
This amplify

824
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Application

825
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
It probably would have just been in

826
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
A****** asking

827
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Listen to the meeting to a disapproving audience

828
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Dan badonde

829
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,456
Who Alex has repeatedly described as an employee

830
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
And someone Alex

831
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Cenzon

832
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:44,160
Who's using an Infowars Mike for the interview who clearly identifies himself as an Infowars reporter in his sign-off

833
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Is going out of his way to make this a story

834
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
They're working

835
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Hard to frame this is a heroic

836
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Intrepid investigative running up

837
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,144
Into a conspiratorial Stonewall in the form of this board

838
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
The point is this is not report

839
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
This is not hearing both sides of an issue

840
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
This is a group

841
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Infowars

842
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
Masquerading as a news Outlet in service of helping

843
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
People like wolf

844
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Ben Helbig

845
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Disseminate their theories

846
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
This is

847
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Clear Behavior

848
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
At this point

849
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
This is this

850
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
Would like a live broadcast version of project veritas

851
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
It's it's they go in there

852
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
A fuk up

853
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Regular

854
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
People day

855
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,632
Not doing anything but it's coronavirus in order to broadcast it and lie about

856
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
So days before the episode they were listening to now they put out the Special Report with Dan Fidelity was there with with

857
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
Wolfgang and now Alex's

858
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
Reporting on the sort of dramas

859
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
Surrounding Wolfgang not being allowed to

860
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
At this this board meeting

861
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
It's integral

862
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
You can see the way that

863
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
There's almost like

864
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
Alex threw Dan Vaden

865
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:54,304
Is causing trouble with the infant

866
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Mirror of his

867
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
Sitting in the studio as there is a

868
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Professional

869
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Is

870
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
Talkin about the Fallout of

871
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
Blue degrees

872
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Who's covering

873
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
Godzilla

874
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,200
Tokyo won't allow Godzilla into ask them questions Woods

875
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
Suspicious is going on here

876
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
The Kraken

877
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
I think we know

878
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
So they talked about this trip

879
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
The United Way

880
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
And I think it's just f***

881
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Hilarious when you realize

882
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
The Dynamics

883
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,304
So here's the headline School Board shuts down

884
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Conspiracy theorist

885
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
And Wolfgang Meghan documentary said he'll send us the raw footage

886
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
As soon as it gets here my copies on memory stick or whatever

887
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
We will get a special report out

888
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Does it need to be seen

889
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Of them

890
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,712
Please shut down the school board then trying to go to United Way and others

891
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
So

892
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
Do you understand what's going on here

893
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,136
Wolfgang and his group tried to get a real newspaper

894
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,208
To cover their trip to the United Way

895
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Knock knock

896
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
You tells Alex and Alex

897
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,632
Oh my God this is red meat

898
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Why did he go to Alex first

899
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
I mean he probably talked about dondi

900
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
While he was there I'm sure there was

901
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
A plan to do both

902
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,152
Varying

903
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Standard

904
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
White people work

905
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
Ride news-times

906
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
Now get out of here this is

907
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
Nothing Alex

908
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
This is the biggest beetle in the world

909
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
Yeah we can

910
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
McQueen office if you're how big do you you're thinking

911
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
Well I've already got Alex on the back burner for

912
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
For sure

913
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,656
So why not take a shot if I were you

914
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
A real news Outlet

915
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Yeah

916
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
So

917
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
How big gets

918
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
To talkin and

919
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
He expresses that

920
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
He doesn't want to be

921
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Jessie

922
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
I'm sort of a crystallizing moment

923
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Of why

924
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
He's on the warpath

925
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
Understand

926
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,560
I want to be doing this absolutely not I'm retired

927
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
Gators not come to my home

928
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
For Christmas

929
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,104
Newtown never heard nobody would have ever heard of me

930
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,200
We go back to that time

931
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,552
Connecticut Freedom of Information request

932
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
Simple questions

933
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,464
Any of those parents who supposedly lost a child

934
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
This is interesting and honestly if I were Alex and I heard that I would take it as a sign that maybe

935
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
Is a little overly personally involved here

936
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
Sounds like he's mad about the police showing up at his house Alicia showed up at my house so now I'm going to dedicate my

937
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
I like to harassing victims of a tree

938
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Yeah

939
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,040
You saying that if the police hadn't knocked on his door he wouldn't have gone on this investigation

940
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Alex can hear that and think

941
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Yeah

942
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,696
All he was doing was sending out legal and legitimate foia request in the police show up

943
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
That's a clear sign they want to silence him

944
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
However that is not the reality

945
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
According to a piece in the New York Magazine intelligent

946
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
Two Florida police officers pay to visit

947
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,264
How big do quote relay a message from Police in Connecticut

948
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
But he risks

949
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,312
Being charged with harassment

950
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
He continued contact

951
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
People in newt

952
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,432
This was not the result of him sending out for

953
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,576
It was because he was doing things like sending Sally Cox the school nurse at Sandy Hook who survived the

954
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
The shooting by hiding in a closet

955
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
A message saying quote

956
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
Why close your eyes when you seen

957
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
Blood before you are a nurse

958
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,560
By any standard that sort of message being sent by a

959
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,632
Complete stranger who's bent on denying a deeply traumatic event

960
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
That you lived through

961
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
That counts as harassment

962
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,008
So by my metrics Wolfgang is Super Lucky

963
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
But he just got a polite visit

964
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
It was a warning

965
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
From the police

966
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
But Optics are everything

967
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
So this visit

968
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,967
Please

969
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,295
It played a big role in legitimizing Wolfgang in the eyes of the

970
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Conspiracy world

971
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
His work is so dangerous that

972
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
They're sending cops into

973
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Intimidating

974
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
It's such b*******

975
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
But that's the way the stuff works

976
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
And Alex's buying Intuit

977
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Completely

978
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
Does he not know what a foia request

979
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:18,495
Does he think that a foia request is just like as long as long as you stay at the

980
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
The top of it like deer foil

981
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
And then you said you tell the nurse that she

982
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
She seemed blood before into

983
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
She's lying so like

984
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:31,039
Just like with United Way like dear foil United Way you send me these documents are okay I think he doesn't

985
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:36,927
Recognize that there is like a processing rules with Toya and it just me cuz it means that I have

986
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,767
A free access to all information

987
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
Information

988
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
That might be the misunderstanding

989
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,823
So how big is convinced that the United Way is skimming money because they wouldn't talk to him

990
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,687
Somebody want to visit or something

991
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
People are getting rich

992
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Bye

993
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
Giving money

994
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,367
Probably true for literally ever

995
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,671
Well I don't care too much

996
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
About that

997
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
Rebuttal that you're making

998
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,047
Because it leads somewhere deeply disturbing

999
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
Nearest him to Lang's

1000
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,191
Amtrak to point out that Alex not only doesn't push back on this

1001
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
It kind of supports it

1002
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,103
Can I take when you look at the amount of money that has been poured into Sandy Hook in Newtown

1003
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,759
Old stores that do United Way Western Connecticut to actually

1004
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,599
You saw that advertised three days before the shooting

1005
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Money three days before the shooting and I think the big red flag is the kinetic

1006
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,303
Attorney general's report

1007
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,143
Want to talk about that Wolfgang Seth area and end

1008
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
All-Star today before as well I mean they were licking their left shoulder right back

1009
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
This is Hardcore information this could bring them down post-hardcore information this isn't opinion

1010
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Just discussed

1011
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Hardcore animation

1012
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
This is hardcore

1013
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
No that is an issue

1014
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,975
As far as information goes that would make it more hardcore I suppose

1015
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
So the United Way is up to no good

1016
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,655
According to how big your auntie gets

1017
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
Listen to a specific about it

1018
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
Is particularly

1019
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
Disgusting on his

1020
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
Why are you saying another way of showing portent

1021
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,199
What are the biggest Smoking Gun cuz I know you're inside this investigation but

1022
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
For folks out there what are the red flags

1023
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:45,183
Looking at 29 million dollars you got to United Way Sandy Hook promise and there are 39

1024
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,047
Community nonprofit organizations within Newtown

1025
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,959
Animal shelter in Newtown Sandy Hook

1026
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
Animal shelter have to do

1027
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:09,759
Can you sing a motive for the locals to go along with the fraud is money I get that

1028
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
Absolutely

1029
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
If Wolfgang halbig or Alex Jones were sincere actors in this they would point out that the reason some Sandy Hook related donation

1030
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Animal Sanctuary

1031
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,583
Is because it was being built in the memory of one of the children who died in the shooting

1032
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
Roman mnn article published on January

1033
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
24th 2013 long before this episode

1034
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,127
Quote the family one of the students killed during the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is asking people to donate money

1035
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
Need to build a new animal sanctuary in her name

1036
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,807
Jenny and Matt Hubbard's daughter Katherine died in the shooting and was very passionate about animal

1037
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
So they decided a good way to honor her memory was to

1038
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,183
Create an animal rescue and welfare center in her name

1039
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,559
The reason that the money may have flowed through the Animal Center the existing animal organization in Newtown

1040
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Is it they were associated with

1041
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Project

1042
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
They had an infrastructure but they didn't have a shelter

1043
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
Which was part of this A Hubbard plan

1044
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Somebody was meant to help

1045
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,871
The VP the vice-president of the animal center Harmony Verna made a statement

1046
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,991
This Sanctuary will be a place where neglected abused or homeless animals can get a second chance

1047
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:17,087
Fitlife a place for children and adults to connect with animals in the natural world

1048
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
Animals have an amazing

1049
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
Capacity to love

1050
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
Heal the human spirit

1051
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
We hope Katherine will thing

1052
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
The most beautiful place

1053
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
It's on Earth

1054
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
In 2014 kinetic

1055
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,143
It conveyed some land across 34 acres to be the home for this new Animal Sanctuary

1056
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Which is

1057
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
Continuing construction to this point

1058
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,799
It's a huge project to that's. Really

1059
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
Particularly surprising

1060
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
It hasn't fully been

1061
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Completed yet

1062
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,943
There's no reason for Wolfgang halbig did not know this

1063
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,735
And Alex's responsibility

1064
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,295
To not passively let this dude lie

1065
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,135
About grieving parents trying to memorialize their daughter with an animal sanctuary

1066
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
F*** both of these dudes

1067
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
It is super

1068
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Yeah man it's been awhile since we've done 230

1069
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,351
18 sidelight like when we were when we were doing bat both of

1070
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Come back and forth you know

1071
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
As acclimated

1072
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
22 differ

1073
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Types of monkeys

1074
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Yeah yeah and then I kind of let

1075
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,127
2013 go after a while we haven't done it now I'm right back to it

1076
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Jesus

1077
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,455
I hope many different ways can you beat

1078
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,015
Disgusting monster

1079
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
You can't be in the present and we and be like all this

1080
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
Disgusting monster is doing s***

1081
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
Like that and then go in the

1082
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,487
And find a completely different level of disrespect

1083
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
Stopped Wolfgang halbig is absolutely no

1084
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,935
Excuse to present this information

1085
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
There is a very easy

1086
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
Accessible explanation for why

1087
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
An animal sanctuary

1088
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
Is getting some of the Sandy Hook donate

1089
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
That makes total sense

1090
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,735
He has a responsibility to know it and the fact that he doesn't

1091
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,551
And it presents himself as an investigator

1092
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
That leads me to the conclusion

1093
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,647
You consciously omitting this information

1094
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
I guess the other option is lying and those

1095
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,583
And if you're if you were former State cop I believe you're doing both at all the time

1096
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
And for Alex

1097
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Doesn't work

1098
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Work that hard

1099
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
So

1100
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
The fact that he

1101
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
He doesn't know this

1102
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,847
Doesn't have this information ready to robot

1103
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Wolfgang

1104
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Is on Fortune

1105
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
He should

1106
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
I don't think

1107
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
I don't think he would

1108
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
Use that information

1109
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Probably not

1110
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
Lesson indication that Alex is lying

1111
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,535
And boring indication that he's not equipped to have these conversation at

1112
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
Unless the point of a conversation is to

1113
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
Passively allow

1114
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
And help

1115
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Answer that

1116
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,823
For money or what's going on

1117
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
Hear that hearing both sides

1118
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:54,015
Okay guess if you hear both sides or something and one of them is a lie and then you don't actually even really here

1119
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Hear the other side

1120
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,647
I said what are you doing

1121
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,767
I got nothing really sore bad he's a f****** bad

1122
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
So I

1123
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
I posit that if you listen

1124
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,679
This fool and review one of the things that you walk away with his kind of that conclusion

1125
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
This is not hearing him out this

1126
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
Do not ask me questions

1127
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
It is

1128
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
Alex trying to direct

1129
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,639
Wolfgang in such a way

1130
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,711
The talking points that our desire to get out

1131
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Got out

1132
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,807
Clearly there was a stand down

1133
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:34,207
Website but I saw that

1134
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
The same people

1135
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,375
Helicopters that look like a fake Grill what about the guy in the woods

1136
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
What about me just go to those points

1137
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,639
So what you have is Alex

1138
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Trying to serve up

1139
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
These are the talking point

1140
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
It's that are kind of safe

1141
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
For the audience at this point

1142
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
So what do you build from there

1143
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,439
Build your credibility in rapport with the audience

1144
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
On these

1145
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
Topics and and endpoint

1146
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
That we've all become accustomed

1147
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
Show me the water too hot yet

1148
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,167
There's that kind of a vibe

1149
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
But get with the program

1150
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Not like it it's Alex

1151
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,847
He's checking anything like that he's doing is like there's a way

1152
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,639
And this is the way to do it

1153
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,687
Yeah yeah that's this is

1154
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
This is

1155
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
LeBron and Anthony Davis in a pick-and-roll

1156
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
Is an alley-oop

1157
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,647
I'm going to wind up slam dunk

1158
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
So

1159
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
Alex

1160
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
I hate this clip

1161
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
More than I hate many other

1162
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Okay

1163
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
Because the reality is in the world

1164
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
You know the real one

1165
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:51,263
The ship pile that we calls the reality is that Wolfgang's Behavior

1166
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Where is causing

1167
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
A lot

1168
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Of damage

1169
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
Emotional

1170
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
And otherwise

1171
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
It's too,

1172
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
To the survivors

1173
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
Victims families

1174
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
In this clip Alex allows Wolfgang

1175
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
To complain

1176
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
That he is being threatened

1177
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Andy's

1178
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,023
Your last wolf came to present himself as the victim in this entire situation

1179
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:18,143
That's all the time I got some crazy people out there

1180
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:29,407
16 simple questions and I wouldn't even be talking today it's it's

1181
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
Wolfgang halbig hit his harassment behind this

1182
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
Thin veneer

1183
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
Of having 16

1184
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
Supposedly unanswered questions which

1185
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
If answered

1186
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
You shut up

1187
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
Naturally some of the questions are unanswerable

1188
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Or meaningless

1189
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,559
Spore already or perhaps most relevant Lee

1190
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
None of his f****** busy

1191
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
Question 12 for example is quote

1192
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:56,031
Why did the parents of two children who died at the Danbury Hospital will not allow their children to donate their organs

1193
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
Text other children waiting for the gift of life

1194
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,199
Go fuc yourself yeah that's a good one if that's one of the questions that makes your toe

1195
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Top 16 that you base this

1196
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Is conspiracy

1197
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
Organ donation is a great thing

1198
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
But it's a choice

1199
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
I have no idea if he's parents

1200
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
Did or did not donate their children's organs

1201
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,511
I didn't look into it because honestly I don't think I have any right to know that

1202
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
Nor do I think it has any relevance

1203
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
The question is meant to imply

1204
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
The beef cube

1205
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
Did not exist to begin with

1206
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
Which is why their parents couldn't own a

1207
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Their organs

1208
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,055
This is not a good face question

1209
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Insinuation

1210
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
It's an accusation

1211
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
And no answer would

1212
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,199
Ever satisfy someone like Alba

1213
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
Imagine these parents saying

1214
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,087
Something like we didn't want to make that decision on behalf of our child

1215
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Organ donation

1216
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
Is an individual's choice

1217
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
And we didn't know what their wishes would have

1218
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Have been

1219
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Do you think how big would stop

1220
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
Asking the question at that point because I think

1221
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Keep f****** wouldn't

1222
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,143
Probably not that's very doubt

1223
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,959
Yeah that that very reasonable explanation

1224
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
Probably mad that I made up that explanation I have no idea who the parents.

1225
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,711
The explanation could just be like hey man we were in a f****** days

1226
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
How about go fuc

1227
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
Yourself how about that

1228
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
Why didn't all this s*** happen because what

1229
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
What do you think

1230
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
Bright

1231
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Any answer is not going to satisfy the answers of the

1232
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Excuse for the behavior

1233
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:26,143
Question number 13 is quote what happened to the 500 children and 60 School staff members from Sandy Hook Elementary on December

1234
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
2012

1235
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:32,799
That's an insanely broad question with approximately 560 different answers

1236
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,639
If he actually cared there's plenty of accounts that you can find regarding people

1237
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,663
Experiences that day

1238
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,199
But he does not care

1239
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
That's the point

1240
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,063
These questions were Shield that Wolfgang halbig used to deflect criticism

1241
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
His behavior was

1242
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Repulsive

1243
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
When he was

1244
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,951
You get told that he's hurting people you just Trot out this list

1245
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
Questions that no one will answer

1246
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
And then he gets to continue

1247
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,071
Pretending he's the heroic figure in this

1248
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,447
This is what people do why don't I know what her favorite flavor of ice cream

1249
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
And then if you answer that you're like what why don't I know what her second favorite flavor of ice cream is this is this is

1250
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,431
It doesn't matter

1251
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
It's Turtles all the way down

1252
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,039
That's what it is this is this is what you do you

1253
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:19,903
Engage in this harassment campaign where you're doing things like emailing the school nurse

1254
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,511
Nonsense b******* right and then people would like a why you doing this

1255
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
That's Gabby

1256
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
Defense mechanism

1257
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
You see it

1258
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
On

1259
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
The part of

1260
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
These more

1261
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,287
I don't know I don't know what the right word is my mind Ultra

1262
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,383
It's between like out there and dangerous conspiracy

1263
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
Little baby girls like you

1264
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
You just answer the question

1265
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
I'll shut up

1266
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Now you won't

1267
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Answer the question

1268
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
Which justifies

1269
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Everything I do

1270
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Right

1271
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Set

1272
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Yeah

1273
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Like

1274
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
It's like the stand-your-ground

1275
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
Defense for

1276
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Conspiracy theory

1277
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,375
Like it doesn't matter what you ask or what you do

1278
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
It is always

1279
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,935
Is there doing it on the Deep

1280
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,239
Yeah I'm only doing this in response

1281
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
To be attacked that you've brought

1282
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
On me

1283
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
So good.

1284
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Yeah

1285
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
So Wolfgang start

1286
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Disseminating

1287
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
I'm talking point

1288
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
It's about how the school was a tux

1289
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Waste dump

1290
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Basically

1291
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
Which Alex would pick up later

1292
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
And definitely run with

1293
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
Yeah

1294
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,231
So when you look at the school itself

1295
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,631
I wanted to talk to the

1296
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:44,127
Here's what they didn't realize they put it in their own newspaper before they

1297
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:50,527
Sandy Hook

1298
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
Groundwater is

1299
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,143
Connecticut Law requires

1300
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,471
Notified

1301
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,895
Children

1302
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:26,367
A that moved into Newtown in 2009

1303
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
That stuff is all bulshit

1304
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
But Wolfgang is pushing towards here is that these parents would never enroll their kids to go to a school like that thought they must

1305
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,703
Not of this there were no kids enrolled

1306
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Open Sandy Hook

1307
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,567
In reality you can find copies of the schools inspection reports

1308
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
2011 a year prior to the shooting

1309
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
And learned they were in compliance

1310
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,711
So the epa's indoor air quality rules

1311
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,015
Further you can find that asbestos is list

1312
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
It is not a problem

1313
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,111
The air quality is given to three on a scale of one to

1314
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Before

1315
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,695
There's no evidence for any of the stuff that Alex is letting Wolfgang

1316
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
How big

1317
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Mega circuits

1318
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
This is just really sloppy horrible shape

1319
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,607
Okay I've got a I've got a solution

1320
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
Alright

1321
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
Let's not rip we can't restrict the

1322
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
The speech

1323
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
What we should do

1324
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
You have to get a license

1325
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,847
If you want to go on

1326
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
Public meat

1327
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
You got to get a license

1328
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
How big

1329
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
You got to get a life

1330
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Maybe it takes 5 minutes just

1331
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
Answer a few simple questions

1332
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
Baby just one

1333
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
Did Sandy Hook happen

1334
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
Can you get your

1335
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
To go on

1336
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,487
TV or radio or whatever you do by Alex impression that would have a chilling effect

1337
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:41,631
If it has a chilling effect on people who disbelieve this should be chilled

1338
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,191
So Alex asked

1339
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Point Blank

1340
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
The how big

1341
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Do you believe

1342
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Happened

1343
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
And Alex knows

1344
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
What Wolfgang Police hat

1345
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,943
So that's not a question

1346
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,015
I would like you to tell my audience

1347
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
What happened

1348
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,879
That is a set up exactly how big to say what he thinks happened

1349
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
Now

1350
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
Wow he's asking this question

1351
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,279
That he knows the answer to

1352
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,351
He goes out of his way to salute

1353
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
And build up

1354
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
How great

1355
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Wolfgang halbig is

1356
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Which you would

1357
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Do

1358
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,615
If you were crying credibility whatever answer you know

1359
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,919
What do you think really happened at Sandy Hook

1360
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,735
People can see your 16 questions at Sandy Hook Justice

1361
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Dot-com

1362
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,831
Salute Your your will

1363
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,903
Tagalog there in at 8 police cars blocking tonight away and

1364
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,719
School Board

1365
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
At the commission

1366
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,559
But bottom line what are you is a

1367
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,167
Almost 40 years investigating police officer you name it

1368
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
What do you think's Happening Here

1369
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
I can tell you

1370
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:58,175
Children teachers did not die on December 14th

1371
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,711
2012

1372
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
That's I mean

1373
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
You wouldn't do that unless you wanted that

1374
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,415
Point to be made by someone you're presenting as credible

1375
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Gyro

1376
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,487
You salute his will

1377
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,071
That's that's as good as Alex saying it himself

1378
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Absolutely

1379
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
So they get back to talking about the United Way

1380
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,679
And how evil it is sure

1381
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
And things get a little silly

1382
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,055
Nobody ever

1383
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,039
More than half the money goes to the executive

1384
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,671
A good charity is the Salvation Army

1385
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,999
Are they

1386
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,583
Salvation Army is not even one of them

1387
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
9 nonprofits

1388
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,103
That's right it's always the same players

1389
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
I don't want to go off on a Jag here speculating about why someone like Alex might be in favor of the Salvation Army but I think it might be

1390
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Baby puzzle

1391
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
Put that together yourself

1392
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:14,463
Instead I'll prefer to reach you from an article published on December 19th 2012

1393
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,255
Just five days after the shooting

1394
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,023
Quote

1395
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,095
The Salvation Army being part of the community is provided food in

1396
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,887
Support to the people of Newtown Connecticut

1397
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,959
After 26 people including 20 children lost their lives

1398
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Pentagon attack

1399
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Sandy Hook Elementary School

1400
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,079
This article is posted on the Salvation Army's website

1401
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,871
They sent out mobile food unit

1402
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
State Health Services

1403
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:37,247
Is they had a representative who appeared with President Obama at a vigil for the victims

1404
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
They even ordered the victims

1405
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
Isn't that yours world record bell ringing

1406
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:45,183
We're after reading those bells of theirs for 80 hours straight they held a quote

1407
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,743
27 minute long moment of Silent ringing

1408
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
Directions Nuys each of those lost

1409
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
That day

1410
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,631
Anyway I have no idea what these assholes mean by not involved

1411
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,959
Put my two cents in here it's a the Salvation Army

1412
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Was very involved

1413
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
In the response

1414
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
These guys are

1415
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,335
Talkingshit there's just no real

1416
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
Now there's just no accepted

1417
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Just can't win

1418
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
It doesn't matter

1419
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
So the interview ends

1420
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,599
And Wolfgang is trying to so-so

1421
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
Conspiratorial

1422
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
Nature2

1423
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,695
An event

1424
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
That happened

1425
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,511
That is that one police station

1426
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
Found another police station

1427
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
I was like hey

1428
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,887
Wolfgang and his guys are coming around

1429
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Which I don't think

1430
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,983
Is it all I think if I were, I probably do that too

1431
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
Fly out yourself one of those

1432
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Cheap

1433
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
It also ends

1434
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,687
Ends with Alex praising

1435
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:44,063
Walker from Danbury over to the Newtown Police Department

1436
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
Police chief Michael Kehoe

1437
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:52,255
Danbury had already notified the police chief and Newtown that we were coming

1438
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,887
They're all working together it's a cover-up no doubt well they better watch it

1439
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,935
Come back and play the report

1440
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,263
That we put together and Scott your spirit your comment

1441
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,567
Powerful information to the school board

1442
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,151
Thank you for the work that your dealings her will continue to track everything you're up to

1443
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
I God bless you

1444
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Okay

1445
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
Wolfgang halbig ladies and gentlemen we got his website up on screen of her radio

1446
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Listeners

1447
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,719
It's just really important for you to go and visit

1448
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,791
The site will put that

1449
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,327
On screen

1450
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
Really important

1451
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Did you go visit at

1452
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
So Alex

1453
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,703
Goes to

1454
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,007
He gets done with the interview with how big

1455
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,823
And he starts ruminating

1456
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
On

1457
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
Did the nature of Sandy Hook a little bit

1458
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
And I think you'll see

1459
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
Familiarity

1460
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
Here in terms of

1461
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
Alex's tone

1462
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,063
He's he's doing a bit of Hedge

1463
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
While still at the same time being like

1464
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
It's fake

1465
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975
Blue screens it's fake

1466
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,791
Again we don't know what's going on

1467
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,119
He goes further and says it's just completely fake I don't know

1468
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,263
Laughing

1469
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,127
I mean it's ridiculous

1470
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,527
Started laughing and I mean like laughing

1471
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,135
When the state police when they're giving press conferences I mean it just is the fakest thing

1472
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
Change the $3 bill

1473
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,231
Fakest things in the $3 bill

1474
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,767
Real quick question

1475
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
If

1476
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
He is

1477
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
Buy if he say well we don't know what happened

1478
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
Then that means

1479
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
He believes there's a possibility

1480
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
That

1481
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
People did die

1482
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,847
Right right

1483
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,639
He is mocking somebody

1484
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Tears

1485
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,247
Possibility that they are real

1486
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,575
Now don't you think if you thought there was a possibility

1487
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
That's

1488
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
It was somebody who would

1489
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
The last thing you would do

1490
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Is make

1491
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Fun of the way they

1492
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
Even if that was a 1% I probably would err on the side of not doing that

1493
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Cancel it was real

1494
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,239
You still wouldn't make fun of

1495
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
There

1496
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
Turn off

1497
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,079
Chances are

1498
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,663
The only way you would do that is if you were one hundred percent sure that it

1499
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Yeah

1500
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Yeah

1501
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
One of the two

1502
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
What are the things

1503
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,367
Like listening to this interview really crystallized

1504
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Stormy is alike

1505
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
After he gets done talking with how big

1506
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,023
He sounds fairly similar to how he was

1507
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,839
In most of the time they were listening to in 2013

1508
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
It's like this is all fake

1509
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,935
Who knows what happened what happened

1510
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Made me realize that there is

1511
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,311
He's not really a discernible difference

1512
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
Between

1513
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
This behavior that I find

1514
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Incredibly important

1515
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
In terms of him

1516
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
Helping

1517
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,759
And pushing Wolfgang's narrative

1518
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,319
And how Alex was almost the entire time

1519
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,391
In the same way that I realized

1520
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Howard

1521
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
Little it matter

1522
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
The specific day

1523
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
Who first sputtered their actors

1524
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
Doesn't

1525
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Matter

1526
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
If he is literally saying

1527
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:14,239
And asked if all of his behavior is pointing people intentionally towards X

1528
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,079
And I think that he's been doing that pretty consistently through

1529
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Is is covered

1530
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
So

1531
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,015
Yeah I suppose if the Practical effects of what you're saying our ident

1532
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,063
It's a call to the Practical effect

1533
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Text of what you

1534
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,391
Of what people are accusing you of saying

1535
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
It doesn't really matter

1536
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
It's a In-N-Out semantical different

1537
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
Exactly

1538
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,583
And so the last whip here from the 13th is Alex

1539
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Expressing

1540
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Globalist

1541
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Would fake

1542
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
Nothing like this which is just to be like

1543
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,519
Possible

1544
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
So you should believe this very credible guy I just had on

1545
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
Pictures of government

1546
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,223
Caught secretly sterilizing hundred thousands of Americans

1547
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
The government caught

1548
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:02,111
Secret medical experiments on blacks whites from the Appalachians to

1549
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
Georgia

1550
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
Northern California to Texas

1551
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,767
These are global

1552
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:14,911
Of course they would say something like this guitar gun of course they would

1553
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
That's not

1554
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,031
Fair that's not fair yes the government is f****** evil I'm on your

1555
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Dino don't make

1556
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
Make it bulshit let's let's do something about the FBI tried to Blackmail Martin Luther King jr.

1557
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,295
Yes the government is f****** evil but don't use

1558
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,599
Denies Andy hookman

1559
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
Right don't do that

1560
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,671
So

1561
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,743
It's a cheap Patricia yeah I'm so mad

1562
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
God dammit

1563
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
So Wolfgang comes

1564
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
Back on September 25th

1565
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
Alex has him back on

1566
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
In 2014

1567
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
And the reason for this

1568
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,847
That someone has uncovered that the FBI crime statistics

1569
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Artistics

1570
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
List

1571
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
0 murders

1572
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,735
For the city of Newtown

1573
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
2012

1574
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
The reason for this it was

1575
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,671
Is there this is just a skeptic

1576
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Is the jury was a jurisdictional issues so it was

1577
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Not listed as murders in

1578
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
In the city it was a state

1579
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Issue

1580
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
It's very easy to get to

1581
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
To the bottom of this

1582
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
But Alex

1583
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
I think is

1584
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
Is suede

1585
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
By this

1586
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,543
And then give us what happened you're doing that to gation and then let's talk about

1587
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103
Important

1588
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,687
Can we get a response from the FBI thank you looking for joining us

1589
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,039
Do you know I did get a response I called in New Haven

1590
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,903
And their responses well baby in the ass by the Connecticut

1591
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:43,231
Put those numbers on their data sheet

1592
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,327
State Police

1593
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
Call the turd

1594
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,519
This is important because they already have access to the information

1595
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
That explains

1596
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,383
Spell and instead of that's why

1597
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,919
Alex has

1598
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
Wolfgang on to spin it

1599
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
This isn't

1600
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Looking at the

1601
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
The fact

1602
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
This isn't looking at

1603
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
The the the

1604
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,879
Is this suspicious

1605
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Or is it not

1606
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
It's saying this

1607
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,535
Here is the guy I'm going to have on as my expert somebody believes

1608
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
If this whole thing was fake

1609
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,959
Idiots not what you would do if you're hearing both sides

1610
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:28,543
What you would do if you were desperately craving

1611
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,591
A way that you could justify

1612
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,895
Being like this guy being like wolf

1613
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:37,503
And I think that FBI statistics thing is probably as good as Alex

1614
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,551
Could get you know like to hear is

1615
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
The SBI

1616
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,111
They say zero

1617
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
Therefore no one.

1618
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
And

1619
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:49,535
You would even though you just spent the last segment telling us all about how the government and the FBI would lie to us

1620
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
No

1621
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:55,423
With no compunction they lied about everything

1622
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,239
Yeah it seems like people like Alex do that sort of thing a lot

1623
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
The Deep State always lies

1624
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
Except when they help me out

1625
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,919
The interesting thing is like you here

1626
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,967
Wolfgang be clearly aware

1627
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,807
Of what the dynamic is here why that number 10

1628
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
And he's like his

1629
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,647
Response to it is come on

1630
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
And Alex laughs and that's good enough

1631
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,999
That's good enough

1632
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,375
Stay up all right moving on that's pretty fun

1633
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
That shitt

1634
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
Address

1635
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:33,823
Trope in every movie that the FBI and the state cops

1636
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
Get into a fight

1637
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:40,223
Every time

1638
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Eyebright

1639
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
It's a whole thing

1640
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
So in order to have

1641
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
How big on and this is new

1642
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,463
Sort of way because I think Alex is now

1643
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,303
Onboard or at least indicating that he's getting on board with

1644
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
No one died thing

1645
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
He now needs

1646
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,447
To justify that in the internal Universe of info

1647
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,031
And one of the best ways to do that is to rely on

1648
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
Trusted source

1649
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,663
Dr. Steve pieczenik

1650
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,735
He's a Jack Ryan character Kombat

1651
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,039
Situations at least 10 times

1652
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,623
These are Heavy Hitters

1653
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,207
Psychological warfare

1654
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,511
Are the CIA basically in the Pentagon

1655
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
From the state

1656
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
Totally Above It

1657
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,679
So it's so what you have here is Alex has

1658
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,727
Steve pieczenik we at this point

1659
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,263
And now again

1660
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Apparently

1661
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,639
Thanks is the most credible person in the world everything old is New Again

1662
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,175
Might be saying some wild out the

1663
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,967
Steve pieczenik

1664
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
Above the military or

1665
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,879
Or whatever who cares

1666
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
He said

1667
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
Day one

1668
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
That no one died

1669
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,231
And so maybe we were late

1670
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,303
To pick up on this maybe we were exercising

1671
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,095
Too much caution

1672
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,727
I knew it stunk I mean why would Anderson Cooper turn it be a green screen

1673
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
His nose disappear

1674
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,335
Why would they have kids going in and coming out clearly stayed

1675
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,615
I just didn't

1676
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,943
Rihanna

1677
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
I mean this stinks to high heaven

1678
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:26,463
I just all I hear is Alex using the exact same

1679
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
Yep from ever but now with the conclusion that no one died

1680
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,375
Great all I hear is

1681
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,911
Alex losing all of his

1682
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:39,775
That's what I'm that's what I'm that's where my head is going now whenever we're listening to this

1683
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
Truly

1684
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,359
Disastrous stuff my head is just going to him Bruno

1685
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
Anylist in the gutter

1686
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
So we get back to these

1687
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
16 Quest

1688
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
And you can

1689
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
Can clearly see

1690
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
How this

1691
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,183
Allegation that these questions aren't answered is used as a cudgel

1692
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:04,095
And for 15 months Alex refuses to call me back the refuse to answer the question

1693
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:08,191
I spent over $15,000 trying to get for your request answer

1694
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,215
PS1

1695
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,799
Not one response to shut you up

1696
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Don't you just

1697
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
I'll go away

1698
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,687
They just answer these questions

1699
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
You Google your answer

1700
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,015
Right I'm positive that a lot of the people

1701
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,343
Probably would have answered his calls at the beginning

1702
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,367
And I bet

1703
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,159
Because of his behavior

1704
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
I'm not going to talk to

1705
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
To the sky

1706
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
I'm guessing

1707
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,583
I can't speak for the people who received his his calls and emails

1708
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
But I would assume that a lot of icono

1709
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
I know what's up

1710
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Up here no

1711
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
Not engaged

1712
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
And he

1713
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
Fruits that is like a they are too afraid

1714
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Answer my question

1715
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Optics

1716
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Optics

1717
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,407
This is what's important

1718
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
You're putting on

1719
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,991
He's acting like a child

1720
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,551
He's acting like a chat the first time but a child ask

1721
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,575
See the question you like

1722
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:01,951
This is the answer to that question let me I'll just take you through real slowly and then

1723
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,487
What about this

1724
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,511
No but what about this

1725
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
So you like your f****** child get out of

1726
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,375
That's the conspiracy strategy

1727
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,959
So Alex is like he's continuing his consists

1728
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Infrared

1729
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Benny's going

1730
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
Far out of his way to present

1731
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
How How big is

1732
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
The best

1733
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,711
Yes coming out this is cut into your business

1734
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
National experts

1735
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
You see the truth

1736
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,279
Didn't get you blackballed of God.

1737
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Yeah

1738
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
Didn't get your blackballed this guy cuz you're standing up

1739
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
But telling the truth

1740
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
And me tell you

1741
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Look man

1742
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
Anybody

1743
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Anybody can

1744
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,007
You come out just say whatever they want

1745
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
But this is a man

1746
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
The Great

1747
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
Perfect reputation

1748
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
Who's come out

1749
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,711
He's risked his livelihood in order to give you all the truth

1750
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,271
I should tell you that prior to

1751
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
To becoming the Sandy Hook

1752
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,111
Conspiracy theory World Center

1753
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,695
Wolfgang halbig was working on a movie about the founding fathers

1754
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Traveling in

1755
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
Into the present day

1756
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
In uncovering the grand

1757
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Conspiracy

1758
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,839
Into the process of trying to write this movie

1759
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,375
He tweeted at Jimmy Fallon

1760
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,935
Trying to get help with getting his project off the ground

1761
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
Sterling Prudential

1762
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,263
That did get him blackballed with

1763
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:22,335
But that was what did it.

1764
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,383
So I mean I guess this sort of like

1765
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Trying to break in

1766
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,455
Hollywood aspect of his

1767
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,503
His career

1768
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Deserted missing

1769
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,295
From Alex's

1770
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
Equation

1771
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Little bit yeah

1772
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,159
But otherwise perfect Witness

1773
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,231
He was a principal one time in Florida

1774
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,327
That is one thing that is fair like he does

1775
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,887
From everything I've been able to tell Jazz have some

1776
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
History in

1777
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,959
It might be a little more sordid

1778
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
It's very difficult

1779
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,263
To the bottom of some of that stuff

1780
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,567
It does appear that he did work

1781
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
In schools

1782
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
And s*** but

1783
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,687
It's irrelevant bad on this Behavior

1784
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
Yeah you know

1785
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
Now

1786
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,551
Sure

1787
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,087
So this

1788
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
The Great Piece of foreshadow

1789
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
For Alex's present day

1790
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
This is a clip that makes

1791
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:16,351
If I'm wrong I hope they sue me and I get all my money

1792
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,935
Actually in 1 Clipper from an interview I didn't

1793
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,751
Take clips from

1794
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,543
Because he's a naturalized citizen

1795
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
He came from Germany

1796
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,871
He does say

1797
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
But if I'm wrong

1798
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
I will renounce my citizenship

1799
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
Check

1800
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
No cuz he still thinks he's right

1801
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Dammit

1802
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,367
But that was a pretty bold.

1803
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
The Wolfgang

1804
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,671
Complaining about how

1805
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
The released

1806
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,719
Information about the

1807
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,791
Shooting but it was a gigantic amount of information

1808
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:49,119
Right right he had some complaints about that and I think this is

1809
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,143
F****** hilarious

1810
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Alex's respond

1811
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,215
And Stephen sedensky the Dead

1812
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
Danbury State's Attorney

1813
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:04,991
You'll spend the rest of your life trying to read it to try to understand it surely that's a tactic in depositions is a dump so much

1814
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
People that can

1815
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Oh is that right Alex

1816
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Is that how you said to her

1817
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:22,911
Super how that accidentally lied to Skaters finding a child Porta nosey

1818
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,983
Play one good deposition deserves another repair

1819
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
This is just an indicator

1820
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,871
He's keenly aware he said so this is a strategy the people employed

1821
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
And

1822
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,199
He doesn't like it when they're doing it but you was

1823
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,247
Happy to employ himself course

1824
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,063
If he doesn't do it then they're going to do

1825
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,111
And if they do it well then obviously

1826
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
He has to

1827
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,719
So even if they don't do it they might do it so he's got to do it

1828
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
The update

1829
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Makes perfect sense

1830
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
Yeah

1831
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,071
So Alex seems to be pretty much on the hook

1832
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Westside

1833
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
With Wolfgang because of this

1834
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,191
This FBI

1835
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Statistic

1836
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
But he has one sticking

1837
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,055
And he needs to get over that

1838
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
And I think you guys are pretty

1839
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,895
Pretty easy automatically do most

1840
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:10,527
And I guess they just picked a group of State Police and others that they knew they had under their control compromised

1841
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
I don't know about Kroger

1842
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,647
Pro gun controllers fellow Travelers

1843
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,695
I mean that's the only sticking point

1844
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,047
Is the criminal operation

1845
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,607
Historically it happens it happens

1846
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
That was quick

1847
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,959
That's my only stick

1848
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,799
Point is how impossible it is to get this many people doing it

1849
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,615
But it happens

1850
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:42,015
My sticking point is how almost universally everyone who's around there is on the same

1851
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,087
Same page as me and my crazy friend Wolfgang

1852
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,647
Against

1853
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,231
And that stuff because it's almost like everyone disagrees with

1854
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
With me but that happens

1855
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
Yeah that's true

1856
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,911
That's not I could dwell on that

1857
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,495
Or I could treat myself to ice cream

1858
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:06,847
So this is the last clip but I have from the September 28th interview and

1859
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,407
It's Wolfgang saying that he wants to Alex

1860
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
To be there in court

1861
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,735
Without

1862
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
You're looking at it the other way

1863
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,111
He's talking about when he sticks it through the

1864
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
And

1865
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:25,791
Alex

1866
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,327
I want you to look at the

1867
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:32,447
And you're going to be amazing

1868
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
All of your listener

1869
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,567
I mean you're a great voice out there but you need to be apart of

1870
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,895
Being a part of that room in the deposition you'll be amazed

1871
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
How long until you do this lawsuit

1872
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:49,599
Well it depends on the phone that gives attorneys one you know money's up front I'm already spend 15,000

1873
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:54,975
I don't care what I'm going to I'm going to finish this

1874
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
They shouldn't come to my house

1875
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,351
I'm not going to stop.

1876
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
They should not come to my house and shouldn't have threatened me right before you scared my family

1877
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,639
It just seems like even

1878
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,455
Through his own telling of so much of this this is

1879
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Personal and Petty

1880
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
He feels

1881
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
Offended that the

1882
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
Police game and was

1883
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Hey man

1884
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
You sent

1885
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Fucken email

1886
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,207
Do people like that school nurse

1887
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,279
That's harassing people you need to stop or else

1888
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,327
Something you know you might get charged

1889
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,351
Do something you like

1890
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,887
Someone might press charges

1891
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,703
That turns into a years-long quest

1892
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,471
That hurts

1893
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
Tons and tons of people

1894
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
Cuz

1895
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
Yeah

1896
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Don't know why

1897
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,919
How big is picture needs to be in an

1898
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,991
Text-to-voice did buy my own petard

1899
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Like that is

1900
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,087
You're going to love being in these depositions

1901
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Wolf

1902
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:58,719
Your router does not love it right now

1903
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:02,303
So I don't know I think we end this 2013

1904
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Now in 2014

1905
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,143
Investigation with a little bit of a

1906
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,471
No it's a little if it's mildly unsatisfying

1907
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Because I don't think

1908
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Vets

1909
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,311
We can't necessarily say

1910
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,104
I can't tell you exactly what happened

1911
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,176
Between May and September what

1912
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,760
So Evolutions Alex add without spending another year

1913
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
Yayoi

1914
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
But I automatically think

1915
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
You know as I've already expressed

1916
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,464
The initial thing that I set out for

1917
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
Is much less important

1918
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
It turns out

1919
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,816
I believe then

1920
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,120
The the larger picture

1921
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,936
Missing the forest for the trees that sort of thing

1922
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
No I I don't I don't

1923
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
Accept anything other

1924
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,800
If that statement

1925
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
We could be wrong

1926
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
What is Speck

1927
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Look at all the things that are fake

1928
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
I don't give a f*** about the

1929
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,528
We could be wrong functionally

1930
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,600
You said it was fake you might as well just said I think

1931
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,392
Sandy Hook nobody died there

1932
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,184
Do with a tiny little

1933
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
I could be wrong

1934
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,304
Not in our capability or are like

1935
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Exerted

1936
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
Mandate relief

1937
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,656
To assess things from a legal perspective

1938
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Yeah so it

1939
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:16,032
You know if none of this is necessarily him committing Act

1940
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
The defamation

1941
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
The interest

1942
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,664
Is more in terms of like when did he

1943
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,736
Change things

1944
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,296
Twist and I don't know

1945
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,880
Now looking back on it I'm not sure they have a really did all that much

1946
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,696
Never answered there was some immediate

1947
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Disgust

1948
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
Towards people saying

1949
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,792
That's a grieving father was

1950
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
By acting

1951
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
And faking

1952
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,680
But that seems to have gone away fairly quickly

1953
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,032
Not even in 2013 you speculating about Robbie Parker death like that didn't that

1954
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
That's not that different

1955
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,456
All of it is to say that I think that his editorial line whose

1956
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
Been pretty regularly can

1957
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Consistent

1958
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,296
And

1959
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,856
It's not that important

1960
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Come to me when he

1961
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
He says these people didn't

1962
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
Turn on 11/11

1963
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
But in terms of

1964
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,608
That being sort of behind a lot of the coverage

1965
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,912
Even if he's not explicitly saying it.

1966
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,472
That that to me is as damn

1967
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
Iic

1968
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
See him

1969
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
Trying to be

1970
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
Like he is

1971
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
Way past

1972
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,616
Cast The Line

1973
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:28,736
But I see him stretching a tiny little toe and trying to leave it on the line is like

1974
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,784
See no I'm not past the line

1975
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,832
Your entire everything is

1976
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
Bass line you can't

1977
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,136
Just leave a little toe on there

1978
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,512
So we wrap up this 2013 investigation

1979
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,816
And say Alex

1980
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
You suck

1981
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
Tragic

1982
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
I don't I don't I don't believe

1983
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
Do I believe that the most

1984
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,568
Generous way you could look at this

1985
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
Is that

1986
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,128
Alex is

1987
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,712
Woefully unable to do his

1988
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,784
Like the best-case scenario

1989
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
The most

1990
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,344
Kind

1991
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,392
Complementary thing I can say

1992
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,672
About what he does

1993
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,720
Is that he has no business doing that

1994
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,536
Because if you allow someone like wolf

1995
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,584
And who you absolutely no

1996
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
Believe that no one died

1997
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
There

1998
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,960
If you allow him to come on your show and say things like

1999
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,776
It's suspicious that this animal shelter got money

2000
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,312
You

2001
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,616
I have a responsibility to either

2002
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
No

2003
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
About the topics that you're going to be cover

2004
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Or

2005
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,504
To say to him

2006
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
I'd is there a possible reason

2007
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,832
Ask a follow-up question

2008
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,416
Instead of just be like haha yeah f*** the United Way

2009
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Further

2010
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,000
Because you know that he has this

2011
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,048
This position you have a responsibility to

2012
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,840
Picture frame things a little bit more

2013
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Responsibly

2014
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
For instance

2015
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,448
If you're going to ask him what do you think happened

2016
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
You can't

2017
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,520
In the middle of asking that question

2018
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,080
Say this guy is amazing we salute him

2019
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,152
Do that because you know the answer

2020
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,712
You are given those compliments to the A

2021
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,736
Answer you know it's come

2022
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,112
I don't necessarily believe

2023
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
But that's an accident

2024
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
Something you would do random

2025
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
But on the off-chance

2026
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,536
Something that you would just do

2027
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,584
Your you're

2028
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,608
Can't be trusted

2029
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:25,216
To be your commentator one of those situations where

2030
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
The

2031
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,032
Sometimes your editorial statement is

2032
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Booking

2033
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:34,176
Like the motor the moment you booked how big you made your entire editorial state

2034
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,248
And laugh in the difficult personal interview

2035
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
Because you can't

2036
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,832
You're absolutely right

2037
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:45,952
I'm just saying like a with with the where we are right now

2038
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:50,816
With although iraq-war Liars coming back on TV onto all of the shows it's like

2039
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
You've made your editorial position clear

2040
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,168
You want us to get light into another War

2041
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,728
The interview starts like this

2042
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:04,640
Excuse me we have from Former Intelligence official alright now you're a f****** liar who lied us into a war

2043
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,664
Are you f****** lying

2044
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,200
Why shouldn't you be in jail

2045
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:11,552
Right I mean that's a different conversation

2046
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,112
Uno people people like

2047
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
Young Turks having David Duke

2048
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,464
Bebe

2049
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,024
Adversarial interview

2050
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,792
It's okay

2051
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,096
So I don't think that Alex

2052
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,888
How big on.

2053
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Is necessarily

2054
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Onnit

2055
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,752
Own editorial decision

2056
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
But having him on

2057
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Praising him saluting

2058
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,896
Building him up as this great expert who's

2059
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,944
Not only a champion

2060
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
For free speech

2061
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,272
And I'm the victim of a

2062
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
Conspiracy against

2063
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,088
Damn but also given up

2064
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
All of this

2065
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,160
Material gain

2066
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
In order to

2067
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,696
To pursue this

2068
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Truth

2069
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,256
That's the editorial

2070
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,840
The framing of how the interview is done alone

2071
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
Speaker volume

2072
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,704
And I think you can also see a little bit of the difference

2073
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,752
It's between this sort of interview that Alex

2074
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
Just giving here in May

2075
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,568
September 2014

2076
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,968
With the you can juxtapose that with Paul's interview with James Tracey in the months after the shooting

2077
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,040
Where is Bolton do a great job of pushing

2078
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:18,624
I'm back he still did push back up

2079
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,184
Explicit repeatedly that I don't agree with you

2080
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:26,304
That wasn't necessarily an adversarial interview but it was at least

2081
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
Pointed cover his own ass

2082
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
Yeah

2083
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,472
It's somewhat critical that doesn't

2084
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
Seem like

2085
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
Nearly as big of an editorial choice

2086
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,592
I have something like these

2087
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,872
Very very

2088
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
Good

2089
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Yeah absolutely

2090
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,760
I think one thing that I learned from the

2091
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
2013

2092
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,832
Since we're now basically on

2093
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
Three different

2094
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
Of Alex we got

2095
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
13

2096
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
In the present day

2097
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,720
Cuz the ones we looked at

2098
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
The most

2099
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
With 15

2100
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Watching him

2101
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
Leading up to an election

2102
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,656
Is a way different type of monster than

2103
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
I've been

2104
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,472
Team and the present

2105
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,032
Because he doesn't have that thing to just heartburn

2106
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
Now he can

2107
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
Throw is f***

2108
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
Disastrous

2109
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,384
Bulshit anywhere

2110
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
Well he didn't know

2111
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
He had a

2112
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,736
Piano as it went along and 25th

2113
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,296
He had the Spectre of Hillary Clinton

2114
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,600
Coming around in order to

2115
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,624
To work with

2116
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,160
And they made a lot out of that

2117
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
They certainly did

2118
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,976
Yeah

2119
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
I don't know I'm trying to reflect on

2120
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,072
On this a little bit

2121
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
I think that like

2122
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
I'm

2123
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
A little

2124
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
I don't know

2125
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
Nonplussed

2126
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,824
About to be

2127
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:46,432
The realization that the literal words coming out of his mouth

2128
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,480
Are not the most important thing

2129
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,016
And the fact that that was

2130
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,808
The road I embark

2131
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Maybe

2132
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,720
Feels like a door not fully closed

2133
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,768
But at the same time

2134
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,328
I'm I'm super grateful

2135
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,864
To have been able to

2136
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,656
Encounter the Boston bombing

2137
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Stuff

2138
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Because that

2139
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Like

2140
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,776
I don't know how anybody could listen to that and not

2141
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,056
I think that Alex is

2142
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,360
One of the most manipulative Liars

2143
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
Basing his s*** on nothing

2144
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,224
And I honestly think that

2145
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,784
From my perspective

2146
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,344
His behavior in the

2147
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Aftermath

2148
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
And evict the immediate

2149
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,440
An ensuing aftermath

2150
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
Of the Boston bombing

2151
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,768
It indicates

2152
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,584
It has implications

2153
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,864
Spare his Sandy Hook

2154
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
It really does

2155
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,192
It it it's such a full picture

2156
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,032
Picture of just taking whatever piece of information not wedding anything

2157
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
Israelite fukkit we're building a narrative

2158
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,128
And the narrative

2159
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,200
Evolving to no one died

2160
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Sandy Hook

2161
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Is important

2162
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:58,368
But it is just an evolution of the narrative it was already there

2163
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
Which is

2164
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
Something's fake

2165
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,488
Write this is all false flag

2166
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,560
Yeah I think the I think what we

2167
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Answered

2168
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
You know

2169
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:11,424
The 2013 it's just the question was

2170
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,448
Not worded

2171
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,264
That way you know when did he say that Sandy Hook

2172
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,312
Was fake should have just been like

2173
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,872
When did he functionally say that Sandy Hook was

2174
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
Because it was

2175
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
Real quick

2176
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,456
Yeah you know in the

2177
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,040
And the post-mortem here's another sort of decompression

2178
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,576
You can one of the notes

2179
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,112
Chicken takeaways Maybe

2180
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,160
In the future if we ever do try and look at

2181
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
Good stuff like this maybe

2182
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,768
Have a better idea of what you want to find

2183
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,096
Well that and I think we learned so much about

2184
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
Like

2185
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,800
You don't want to speculate on what's going on inside somebody's mind while they're say

2186
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
You know whether or not

2187
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:54,432
He's telling the truth or he believes it or he's lying you know you can't just speculate

2188
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Save that

2189
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,552
But when you see the same techniques being used in the

2190
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:04,672
Sandy Hook aftermath and the Boston bombing aftermath you that gives you a clearer idea of when

2191
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,696
The next thing hits

2192
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
We're not speculating on what you think

2193
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
We're going back to

2194
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
To the context of

2195
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Situation

2196
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
And this is what

2197
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,608
You're doing

2198
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,912
Regardless of whether or not you believe it or not

2199
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,448
Not we know exactly what

2200
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
You're doing

2201
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
And that means something

2202
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,520
I mean something

2203
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,312
So anyway

2204
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,848
Just need to take a break

2205
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:26,176
From present

2206
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
The manage to do that

2207
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,296
And I guess we'll be back in the present day

2208
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,856
Do we have to

2209
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,136
Can we get a time machine

2210
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
Maybe what we got to get

2211
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,952
Wolfgang halbig

2212
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,048
Replay
