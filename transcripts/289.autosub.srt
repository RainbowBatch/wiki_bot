Galaxy color with your Japan I love your work

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Beverages

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Jordan

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
Did you have a child

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,880
It's interesting not really in childhood because I moved around

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,208
Throwing up in elementary school and moved

7
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
Boston Cambridge

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Hawaii

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Missouri

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Shipping School

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,520
Start

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Each other

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
High School

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,136
Exactly

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
I did that

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Discovered nemesis

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
He's as being really productive

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
Strategy in order to motivate myself to do better in class

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
I would also

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Well

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
One guy one of my classes wearing

22
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
It's what I would do that I've never talked okay

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,696
How do well in the class to do better than the fun game you can play the only time that ever like I was ever

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
Anything confirm for me

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
There was a guy

26
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
The glasses

27
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Who was just

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Real Annoying

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,264
Early entry level philosophy class to ask stupid questions

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
The professor gets annoyed with everybody

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
So he was my Nemesis in that class

32
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
I hated a behavior the swastika

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Monday

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Is doing somebody exercise

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
Working out in college

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
A little bit

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
My liked songs are

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
And I'm like

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,360
Really really

40
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Monster underneath

41
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
It was it was it the clown

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
It's the truth

43
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
You hear people breathing really hard when they're lifting

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Healthy supposed to breathe

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Just like

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,488
And I looked over

47
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
And he has like one bar of weight

48
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Is over doing it for attention

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
This guy's annoying everywhere

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Typically remember

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
Kind of like my animosity

52
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
For a purpose

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Situations

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
Is the show I know a lot about Alex Johnson

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
That is absolutely required

56
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,888
I don't care another personally

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,728
Restaurant of the show

58
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
Situation

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,152
Is that out of the studio Bullhorn in Washington

60
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
Proceed striking himself act on Twitter

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,808
He's been out of the studio and we have like Owen Shroyer filling in

62
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
The last couple days

63
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Buddy

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Studio on Monday

65
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
We can cover that

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,352
Halfway through

67
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,192
All he was doing was gloating about the idea that a Muslim group

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Did commit the ACT

69
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Chewbacca

70
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Exactly what I thought it would be

71
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
I would already kind of talked about that events on our on our way

72
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
You know my birthday

73
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,160
Another one of this s*** ice can't do it

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,768
And then beyond that it also has a Wacky Wednesday thing that I've been working on

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
But

76
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
I need a little more time

77
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
So

78
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
We are back in the past

79
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Iraq

80
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
213

81
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031

00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
There's some there's some stuff in here Monday through Thursday

83
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,551
No this is Thursday through Sunday Thursday Friday Sunday

84
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
You might be wrong about that

85
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Are we getting any tamales today

86
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Nothing that are d'alessio

87
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,239
We'll see what we get an artist though but before we do

88
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Joseph thank you so much

89
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Veronica Mars

90
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
F*** off

91
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Is your Kristen Bell

92
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
Next Market

93
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
I'm a policy wonk

94
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
Think about it

95
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Christine finally I'd like to see

96
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Columbia Missouri watch the number of episodes of Lost

97
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,663
You're now a technocrat

98
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:16,063
Someone sodomites

99
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
Couldn't button support the show and guys we are

100
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,551
Of the way from me getting this tattoo is very fragile tattoo

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,695
I'll give you an update on that my brother is designing as we speak very likely I'll be going to get it this weekend

102
00:06:53,951 --> 00:07:00,095
Because inevitably we will end up over the phone

103
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
They are forcing my hand for this dumb joke that I made about getting a

104
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,055
It's going to be

105
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
It's supposed to be

106
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Standard English

107
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
Actual words are a better way to go

108
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
In terms of that

109
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,303
Now maybe I'll get to misspelling tattooed on my itself somewhere else

110
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
2 time is a little bit of a slog

111
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
213

112
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Walking through molasses

113
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
I'm not going to lie to you

114
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,943
There is a lot of talking about

115
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,319
Okay his show is almost entirely become about how he went to

116
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Almost all he's talking about

117
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
There's very little other Kant

118
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
Kind of got to a point where I was like

119
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Almost

120
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,775
Just looking for out-of-context drop

121
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,663
Enjoy rapid-fire

122
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
We can let these breathe and enjoy a little bit

123
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Avatar complete

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Yep

125
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,183
Set my timer

126
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,767
Do you know who lives there

127
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,191
Okay cool score

128
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,335
This comes on the Tails of him having Mancow on

129
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
Do perfect

130
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
That's not giving it Kant

131
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
It's just

132
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
Apropos of nothing

133
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
And they talked for like

134
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,559
Half an hour about f****** William Shatner

135
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Being a great guy

136
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
I guess that sounds nice good friends with William Shatner

137
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,615
He's apparently a living embodiment of how you just got to keep

138
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
They did not bring up his wife

139
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,623
Their coverage

140
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
The last out of context

141
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
Believe me I want nothing more

142
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
This

143
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Me too me too

144
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
I want nothing more than that you should follow your heart

145
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Quit

146
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Year on January 10th

147
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
2013 episode with Alex

148
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Who's there

149
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Fictionalized versions of going to talk Spears mortgage

150
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:07,999
Should have the walls the whole Studios just Bedlam also

151
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
You got harassed by cops

152
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Chase to the airport Newark

153
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Or whatever

154
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
He presents a slightly

155
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Elevated version

156
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Enough that you're on the top

157
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
You can see little kernels of

158
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
How the narrative

159
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Is starting to

160
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:29,759
To evolve a little bit

161
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Next clip

162
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
To the story that is absolutely

163
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
3 globalist in a hot tub

164
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Play the song

165
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
When you're angry musician mess with all the street

166
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
So here is what's different about this on the tap

167
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
He had a little bit about how he had some allergies

168
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
And stuff like that before

169
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Much of a new introduction

170
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
Use for white yelled a Porygon

171
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Important thing that's different about the police harassing him

172
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
That was never

173
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Whenever and I quote

174
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,831
Police or whatever are popping out of the dark

175
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
Before this Alex that only been talking about the police harassing him after the fact trying to walk him out

176
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
Alley where they were a hotel when he came back

177
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
The reason that you bring nothing they were harassing him before

178
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Not said

179
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Is because Doug hack

180
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Of the Northeast

181
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Network one of Alex's weirdo

182
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Heckman was on earlier in the show

183
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
And he was talking about how

184
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
They were following a massive with Alex the whole time

185
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
And it was all the plan to get him to a Starbucks where a lady was going to cost

186
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
And then I could take him down with this new quote-unquote

187
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Information

188
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
And Alex's Incorporated that was only telling of his experience

189
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Intelligent

190
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Alex's individual experience

191
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Of the past has now changed

192
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
This is a mark of bulshit

193
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
That is

194
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
So that's

195
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
The show

196
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
Did Doug Hagmann being boring to s*** and telling Alex that he had secret sources

197
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
That he was there was a takedown

198
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Or some s***

199
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Alex

200
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Begets

201
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
We have to break

202
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Through break at Breakout

203
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Interview with Gerald Celente

204
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Cuz there's big news

205
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Chris morning

206
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
Nature of society

207
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
We had

208
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
Who are these people that can let you know

209
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,719
How many shrubs in Texas

210
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
At least his voice

211
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
As compared to a lot of these other f****** dumb dumb gas

212
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
High School

213
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Real California

214
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
And Alex break the news

215
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
We're talking about

216
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
People are on drugs

217
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
He's interrupting is pretty

218
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,343
Pointless interview is going to be a planned Financial

219
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Business

220
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Breaking in with his news of the schools

221
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,351
What happened was a student at high school brought a shotgun to school and wounded two people before being talked into putting his gun down

222
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Surrendering to the

223
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
You don't claim that he didn't remember anything

224
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
From the point where he was at his house

225
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
Until right after the first shot was actually fired

226
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,663
But prosecutors introduced

227
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,015
For instance after surrendering to the police told them the correct number of shells

228
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
Later claimed that he had no memory of loading

229
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
Things like that are pretty good reason to have a little bit of a

230
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Suspicion

231
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Skepticism

232
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
I don't remember anything

233
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Call boscia

234
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
Be quiet if only Elsa because you posted like

235
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
I hear it that the shooter had written

236
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,615
Short story that involves

237
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
And the day before the shooting

238
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
He posted it online

239
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
Indications

240
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Premeditation

241
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
VIP of like I don't remember anything that happened

242
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
A little bit

243
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Dubious

244
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
Alex and Gerald use this as an opportunity

245
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Just no doubt about all that shooting

246
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:09,727
But they're particularly interested in doing this with literally no evidence or even any information about the shooter

247
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
Psychiatric medication

248
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Which caused him to carry out the shooting

249
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
I was trying to figure out if this was what

250
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
Jason my research led me to dr. Peter langman

251
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,735
The psychologist and expert on school shootings

252
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Monroe to paper regarding the

253
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
That's flying around that School shooters are all on

254
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Redo the opening paragraph

255
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,255
Their numerous websites devoted to the belief that psychiatric medication

256
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
Pensacola school shootings and other acts of mass violence

257
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,191
I've seen claims that virtually all Rampage shooters were on or had recently been on Medicaid

258
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
Based on my research these claims are not

259
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Open cases lineman research 7

260
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
3% of the Secondary School shooters

261
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
High School shooters

262
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
They looked at we're not on psych meds nor have they ever been

263
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
The shooter at Taft High School is one of that 70

264
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
He was not

265
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Whatever

266
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,999
The reality is that a pretty sizeable majority of School shooters are not on psychotropic medication at all

267
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
And even if the statistics were flipped it wouldn't prove causation

268
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Because Jordan

269
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
During the same

270
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,727
People on drugs like Prozac went through the roof

271
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
Prime rate

272
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Dropped

273
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,127
These are burner pills argument held any water

274
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
Severely spike in violent crime rates from that night

275
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
1880s to the current day

276
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
And that just doesn't match up with reality

277
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
So

278
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
That's all I'm that's all I'm saying

279
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
I mean what else

280
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Response

281
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
What is an obvious

282
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Play bad face

283
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Argument

284
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
If it's coming if that's your

285
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Mediate

286
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
The news of another

287
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Your reaction is

288
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Is not like

289
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Oh s***

290
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
We got to get people off site

291
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Sleight of

292
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Spell psyche

293
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,695
What it is is an attempt to claim the space early in case

294
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
And then it builds up your narrative

295
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
But all these things are fake

296
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Or there

297
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
People who

298
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Do you think Madison

299
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
And then when it's

300
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Not true like in this case

301
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
You can

302
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Pretend

303
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
I hope people don't look into it

304
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Or you can just ignore the fact that you

305
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
You said that that was what's going

306
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
This is what he does

307
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,967
No matter what you end up being able to reinforce

308
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Narrative

309
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Without any Costco

310
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
So

311
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
He breaks that news

312
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Because Gerald

313
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Is there

314
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
I thought it upsetting

315
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
That made me very upset

316
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Contacts wouldn't help

317
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
That was apropos of almost

318
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
He means that it is

319
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
Become a fad

320
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Hurt animals right

321
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
Which I was alive in 2013

322
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
I remember I don't think it was

323
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Ever she

324
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,935
Call the black building up around

325
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
The news

326
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Synchro

327
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
No

328
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
It wasn't even like a

329
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Real Spike

330
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Happened

331
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Please be a local news story

332
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Even like a Michael Vick

333
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Connection

334
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Michael Vick got in trouble in 2000

335
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
7

336
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
I got out of prison

337
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
2009

338
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,471
I can't I don't know what this is further Evidence

339
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Alex Jones May have killed some dogs

340
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
So Alex and Gerald

341
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
Versation

342
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Back from break

343
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
And there's more news

344
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
About the bakery

345
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Field shooting

346
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
Northwoods

347
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
Shooters

348
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
So

349
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Let's just

350
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Established

351
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
They have a drill

352
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Not really okay

353
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,455
Lying about representing

354
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
Also I know from

355
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Looking into this

356
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
He's going to going to stop here

357
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
This is going to get

358
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
This narrative

359
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah I'm certain

360
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
Right so what are cornerstones of rationalizing and reinforcing

361
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
No one died

362
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Sandy Hook narrative

363
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,424
Annihilus narrative about other events

364
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
More generally

365
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
Is the idea that there's always drills overlapping with

366
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
That it's very consistent

367
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
Route conspiracy

368
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,528
Alex all the f****** time

369
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
And I'm certain it'll be pretty easy to put together on a project

370
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,928
Drill

371
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
All the goddamn

372
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
The idea goes like this

373
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,864
Nefarious globalist want to pull off this fake shooting order to sway public opinion

374
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
That's a noble gun-loving Patriot

375
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
But it's difficult to get all the pee

376
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Pieces in place till 4

377
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
That's they conduct drills

378
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
The event they plan to

379
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Quote goes live

380
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,920
Which shooting or

381
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Send it to a fake shooting

382
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Depending on what day you ask

383
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
That's largely the way that

384
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Narrative is

385
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
I don't understand how

386
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Drill

387
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Today's date

388
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Forehand

389
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
That is a problem

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Problem

391
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Is that is that like a

392
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,704
I'd like a dry run of the way

393
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Is it like as possible

394
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Like a dresser

395
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Hey my buddy

396
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
So I don't know exactly where his head's at

397
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,248
It's just something it's like

398
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
If you're thinking the idea just generally sound stupid

399
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
It is

400
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Yeah but it works

401
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Because it relies on

402
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Exploiting 12 great shortcoming

403
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Susceptibility to ascribing mean

404
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Coincidence

405
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
There was a shooting drill at the city about 20 miles away from Newtown

406
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
That's a pretty wild

407
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
More than a coincidence

408
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
When its uses

409
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
The consistent pattern

410
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
And that's why it's important to apply to all and any

411
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Situation

412
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
That comes up

413
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Because on its own

414
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
It's part of every single event

415
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Then that's

416
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Suspicious

417
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
And then you hijack people's mine

418
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
With that sort of thing

419
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
This is why Alex

420
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,792
The super quick to say that this Bakersfield shooting shooter

421
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
If you wasn't before doing any of the facts of the case

422
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Regardless of what the reality is

423
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Constant reinforcement

424
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
The idea that

425
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
Becomes what they believe

426
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
The success of the narrative doesn't depend on fact only on the appearance of a pattern

427
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Built on the exploitation of coincidence

428
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Combined with just outright malicious

429
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
The latter is what's happening with the baker

430
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Crisfield had a drill

431
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Version of

432
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,096
Alex reporting reporting bakersfieldnow website

433
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,192
The story doesn't say that they had a drill at the school that actually literally says

434
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
The training took place at a dorm

435
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
University

436
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,920
A two-day seminar concluded with a simulated gun men's stocking a dormitory at San Diego State University

437
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
About 2,000 participants

438
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
School districts in universal

439
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
San Diego County Los Angeles

440
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Bakersfield

441
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Participate

442
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,904
They practice barricade indoors hiding escaping

443
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Confront

444
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,768
Somebody to argue that school district not providing this kind of training

445
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
In the aftermath of Sandy Hook might be them being negligent

446
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
Which is where

447
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
This part of the

448
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:45,568
The Narrative that there was a drill at the school would be reinforced by a January 11th article posted on Fox News

449
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Which became the subject

450
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Inappropriate editorial

451
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,296
The headline California school practice lockdown drill minutes before shooting

452
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
Which is barely discussed in the body of the actual article

453
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
That is

454
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Very misleading

455
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
The second paragraph

456
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,376
Just 10 minutes before it happened

457
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Andar

458
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Teachers were giving us protocol

459
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Because of what happened

460
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
Oscar Nuno student at a high school set

461
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
It's probably super unfair to call that proof that the school had a drill

462
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
However

463
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
Stop online conspiracy theorists from using that quote to justify their contention

464
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
There was a drill at

465
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Taft High School that overlap

466
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
The shooting and thought it's

467
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Completely fishy

468
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Increase the troops

469
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Surprised no one

470
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,744
One of the most visible names pushing this theory was Shepard ambellas

471
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,352
Stuart internet weirdo who would go on to become an Infowars employee

472
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
Who's most notable contribution

473
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Seems to be him successfully convincing Alex that there were helicopter

474
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Firing on civilians

475
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
At the Las Vegas shooting

476
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Last year

477
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,944
Isn't it interesting

478
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Still helping.

479
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
Open up the world

480
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
Story of a

481
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,792
Ohio Alger

482
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
That sounds right

483
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,240
Yep

484
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,616
0 face that Alex won't find that article

485
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
And then go from there

486
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Which was the

487
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
The article in the first place

488
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
For everybody

489
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,952
And that's the entire point of Alex on the reporting that there was a drill

490
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
The school in the article actually said that there was shooter training

491
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
Diego State University

492
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
There's nothing suspicious

493
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
There's no evidence of any drill

494
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,288
Description they could very well have just been teachers telling students what they do

495
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Which makes sense

496
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
This was the first week of January

497
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Coming back from their holiday break

498
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,736
Right before which there was a terrible school shoes

499
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,576
All this makes complete sense in exactly what would happen

500
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
In a normal well

501
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Reasonable

502
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Absolutely

503
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
You know I

504
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
I didn't

505
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Really make this connect

506
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
When we talked about proper

507
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
And Alondra

508
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Being you know that

509
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Crazyblox

510
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Gets Amplified with

511
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
More and more legitimate Outlet

512
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
It also

513
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Like Fox News

514
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Publishing

515
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Means

516
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Crazier Outlet

517
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,184
With the credibility of Fox News today

518
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,792
Exactly I think Fox News is probably on the

519
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,424
Capricious side of appropriate

520
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,520
Wrong to make that the headline of

521
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,360
The story considering that most of the article isn't about that

522
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
That's irresponsible

523
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
Is this quote from this

524
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Which they could twist

525
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Into being like

526
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,344
You know there was that they practice new lockdown drill

527
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Fortunate

528
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
You know like

529
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
It's it's bad

530
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
They're not as evil as Alex

531
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Unless it is with the cognate

532
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
The people like Alex will take that headline

533
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
It is it is it is and that's f******

534
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
If you look at it in a vacuum

535
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
One time

536
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
Concerted pattern

537
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,088
It just doesn't look good

538
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
But you know what does

539
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,072
Gerald Celente is ideas

540
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:58,240
In many ways what is it with all this

541
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,592
The other trans researcher

542
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Aubrey

543
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
It's this is something that Alex

544
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
Definitely

545
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Much more extreme version

546
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
What I would like to see as part of the next Revolution

547
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Is secession

548
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
I don't want a gang of I-35

549
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Goodnight

550
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,736
Misery

551
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Friends

552
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Destroying the nation

553
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
I wonder if he's still

554
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
Supports the sachet

555
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
I want

556
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,304
Stopped like couple years back I want to wander

557
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
Estranged

558
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Doesn't he live in New York

559
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,288
I don't see a problem

560
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,360
New York voice

561
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Allstate

562
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Ulta

563
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
What's the dissolution of the Union in

564
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Secession he wants to dissolve

565
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
The federal government

566
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
I've been reconstituted because federal government has become invaded by the

567
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
Definitely not.

568
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,176
So you believe that the federal government isn't

569
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Entrenched

570
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
Have the authority

571
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Because the

572
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,880
To dissolve the federal government and I bring it back together

573
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Before

574
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
I would never work

575
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
Is

576
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Create

577
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,120
A ton of different countries

578
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,960
That would also unsustainable

579
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Create

580
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
World as we know it like that

581
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Asteroid

582
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,432
Political Valentines

583
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:20,064
Wisconsin having to negotiate trade deals with a f****** united king

584
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
Baby talk

585
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,232
So in this next clip Alex gets a call

586
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
From a guy

587
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,840
And he's complaining about Glenn Beck a little bit but in doing so

588
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Snapshot of what Alex

589
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
His listeners think

590
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Tutas Reese

591
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
Chris what's your take on all this

592
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
Something that you protected from

593
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
I'm a one-year listener first-time caller

594
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
And that piece of garbage going back is only

595
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,672
Thinking about doing your homework and doing your research and last night I did my research and went on YouTube

596
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
2001

597
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
You call 911

598
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
On the spot

599
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
3:30 equals iWatch

600
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Some YouTube games

601
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Really travel

602
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Really

603
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Stupid

604
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
The presentation

605
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
Couldn't continue his listeners

606
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,760
Subscribe to more rigorous methods

607
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Fact-checking

608
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Yeah that would be

609
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Item

610
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
I don't like

611
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
Like living in a world where

612
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
You can say I do

613
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
My research

614
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
I went to YouTube

615
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,568
You have covered all your checks off

616
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Abu

617
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
Stupid are you going to go with citing your sources MLA

618
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Coronavirus

619
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,208
64 video player 69 and I got to say

620
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
How do I put

621
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
You're not going to get a degree frame

622
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Sale

623
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:15,776
Most of the show is just Alex talking about Piers Morgan

624
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
Launch more clips

625
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
I felt it would be

626
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
Sort of redundant

627
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
I'll bet this episode ends with Alex

628
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Going to retransmission

629
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Which is what he does

630
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
You don't know what I mean

631
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
Is show will Air

632
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
And then

633
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Vcm stream

634
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
It'll just restart whenever his show on

635
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,256
Yeah so he is going

636
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Retransmission

637
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
The interview with Doug Hagmann

638
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,400
The beginning of the show so you know that if you're listening

639
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
Straight through

640
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
He's promoting the interview is going to start as soon as

641
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
The show restart

642
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Just listen to

643
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,688
Transmission on a garden on 5:20

644
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
Was just allergies

645
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,168
Well he's confusing

646
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,032
X-Files spin-off show the lone gunmen

647
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,480
Call Alex results

648
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
Normal for him to

649
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,024
Think of

650
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:49,216
Security confirming source that they are stocking

651
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,928
What else is expressing their is the same thing people who believe in like stalking

652
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
There is a phenomenon where a lot at like if there's a form of paranoia where people believe that

653
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,544
Stop

654
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Jack Hackman

655
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,808
Is lending credibility to Alex's idea there was a New York everyone was trying to get him

656
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
That's bad

657
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
I meant for Alex to be like the things you see in movies

658
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Really make

659
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Crystal clear

660
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
His break with

661
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Dealing with reality on realities term

662
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,008
It'll be interesting cuz if I agree with Alex

663
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
Principally on like issue

664
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Nuts

665
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Mexico and people were like

666
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
That I would be like

667
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
I got to get a new

668
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
New co-host or I got to get you

669
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Help

670
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
More entertaining

671
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,776
Exploited your your break with reality

672
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Good mental

673
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,736
Literally doing it

674
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Sounds crazy

675
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
And then he says

676
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,624
It's just like in a movie

677
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Which makes him sound crazy

678
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
So it is

679
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
Is obviously

680
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
I told you they were trying to make

681
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Give me sound crazy

682
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
Because I just found another piece of the gang stalking stuff to is the idea of like

683
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
Not too actually

684
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Stalker

685
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,456
Elicit the reaction of you saying you're being stalked by everybody

686
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:12,576
I would discredit other things you have to say

687
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
To do

688
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Bright

689
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
So are we to the 11th

690
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Thumbs up the show with

691
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
I don't want to call it

692
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Cuz it it

693
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,056
No it's not that uncommon

694
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
Starting to show with a sales pitch

695
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Is a little bit

696
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,224
Common and I think it actually illustrates

697
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Something really important

698
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
But I want to talk

699
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
January

700
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
2013

701
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
Texas

702
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,056
Texas Revolution

703
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,600
T-shirt

704
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,464
Bear arms shall not be infringed

705
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:28,864
Just got put this t-shirt up for sale

706
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,472
I'm just looking at the church I was wearing this morning

707
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,032
T-shirts

708
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Here's what I want to say about that

709
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
What is it

710
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Pieces of

711
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
The Sandy Hook

712
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Lawsuit

713
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
Is about Alex's

714
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
Profiting off of his coverage

715
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,072
I didn't make any money off of

716
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
I do think it would be hard to

717
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
Tres necessarily

718
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,496
But I think that this clip is a pretty good illustration

719
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Exactly

720
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Is profiting off

721
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Now

722
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Did the

723
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
Intrinsically

724
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,712
Super Evil behavior of the crisis actor

725
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Stuff is only starting

726
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Visible to the sir

727
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
But Alex

728
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
Is making a lot of money selling these

729
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,208
It's the best seller shirt that he's ever had

730
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
And he's only been selling it for a short. Of time

731
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
The common take it with an AK-47 on

732
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Now

733
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
He's selling these shirts

734
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Explicitly

735
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Through the coverage of his show

736
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
Where you staying

737
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,872
Is a representation of his rhetoric

738
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Come and take it

739
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
You want to take my gun

740
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
If he had

741
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,832
Which is audience into a frenzy of like they are immediately going to come

742
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
He sure wouldn't sell that well

743
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
The rhetoric

744
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,744
Serves as a de-facto sales pitch for this shirt

745
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,096
Important is so strong in the

746
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
Time that we're looking at your the beginning of 2013

747
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
It's because Alex is using the idea of the response

748
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
The people are having

749
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Sandy Hook

750
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
That is his rationalization for there about 2

751
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Right so he is using

752
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
Sandy Hook

753
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
Excuse they will use

754
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
To take your gun

755
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
Which is what he is using to fuel his rhetoric

756
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
Which is what is selling these sure

757
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
So on a suit of tertiary

758
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Second third hand

759
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Level

760
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:36,608
His response to Sandy Hook is responsible for this shirt being a best seller there is a pretty clear path

761
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Through that

762
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
That's not making me crazy

763
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,288
He's not dealing with Sandy Hook as a real

764
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
Either manufactured

765
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
He's what

766
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Behind his ability

767
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
To Market this shirt

768
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
In the way that you

769
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Successful

770
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
And I enjoy it so I don't know is this

771
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Is usable in any way

772
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
For the lawsuit

773
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,768
Does profit off

774
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,352
His behavior

775
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
Directly

776
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Jessie

777
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
Whenever whenever he's

778
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,408
That fear of

779
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Collapse

780
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Gold sales

781
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
You know that will go

782
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
One Step removed because

783
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
People believe

784
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Baby pigs

785
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
Saying these crazy things

786
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Isolating them

787
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Create

788
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Yeah

789
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
To represent

790
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
Being apart of

791
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Did you do that

792
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
T-shirt

793
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Clearly

794
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
I'm one of these guys

795
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Yeah it's like

796
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Removed

797
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
From amore

798
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
Crystal clear

799
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
It's just as

800
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,927
Absolutely

801
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
It's a it's a good reminder

802
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
That

803
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Like there is

804
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
The principal

805
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
Can also be

806
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Automotive

807
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
With that argument

808
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Courses

809
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
He uses that regardless

810
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
You know right

811
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Whenever he's

812
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
I suppose the only thing that may

813
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Makes this one different

814
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
So soon

815
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Suggest they are cap

816
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
It does suggest that

817
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
As opposed to a shirt that was

818
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,375
You know he's been yelling about gun-grabbing

819
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,471
90s Usher he makes

820
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
Doesn't have the same

821
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,359
Closeness

822
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
Yelling about gun-grabbing forever dozen

823
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,711
Mean that it takes on the same character is

824
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Has

825
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
In this. That we're looking

826
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
That's certainly true yeah

827
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Yeah Gunn talk

828
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
In this time

829
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
Consistently Stewart Road Larry Pratt

830
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,535
Other gone weirdos it's almost the only issue that he's even covering

831
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
From the

832
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
Time right after Sandy Hook

833
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,447
January 11th that we're at now

834
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,263
To the time that we looked at whether S2000

835
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Obviously there's shades of guns

836
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Everywhere but it's not like

837
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
Know your rights

838
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Focus

839
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
And it's focused

840
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,271
Cuz he believes in what he's misrepresented about

841
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
NFL

842
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,207
Yep capitalization you ever monetize

843
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
It's very direct

844
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Fisher

845
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
Has a Latin phrase on it

846
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Interesting

847
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Doesn't know how to say

848
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,311
How do you say that in Latin

849
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
Tom and Chee

850
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
Now here's what I have to say about that

851
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
2013

852
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Is way too late for Alex

853
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,135
Do not know how to say molon labe

854
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Vernacular

855
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
It's like him not being able to say Posse Comitatus

856
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,887
Which is insane

857
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
He doesn't know how to say f****** Bowl on

858
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
Both know that he is illiterate

859
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Especially in foreign

860
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
It is trash

861
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Is

862
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Just

863
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,623
Wall-to-wall

864
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:47,231
The only things more interesting at all in that show is the sure plug

865
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,583
I'm not being able to say molon labe

866
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
3 hours long

867
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
It is

868
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Just

869
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Such dog

870
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
It was one of the worst episode ever listen

871
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
I don't know if 13 other hours of yelling

872
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
Maybe the 11th would have been fresh

873
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,599
Maybe it would have been

874
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Investigation

875
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
Think about it

876
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
To the 13th

877
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
The Sunday

878
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
He makes it even more

879
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
The connection

880
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
Two stages removed

881
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,807
Constitutional republic

882
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,655
Firearm

883
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,567
I'll call on you forever

884
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,223
Now that's an interesting Theory

885
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,671
Eggs are the only ones who can defeat the globalist as opposed to the idea of like

886
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
Ilottery

887
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Ciara

888
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Seems like

889
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
I don't know if you met my

890
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,447
My dude Oakham I've only ever read it

891
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
I've never heard it pronounced

892
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,823
Occam's razor ever heard of that guy

893
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Okay

894
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
Suggest that may be the simplest

895
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:47,551
Simplest explanation is ever

896
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,391
I'm already off the rails by popsicle sticks

897
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:06,239
Be gone to college he might know about that

898
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,527
But that does not stop him from waxing poetic about college Years

899
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,671
If it starts

900
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,327
Everybody everybody

901
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,959
You didn't go to college

902
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,591
You working two jobs

903
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
Bucket junior college for a little bit and dropped out he's expressing sort of an archetype

904
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
But he didn't wave

905
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,927
College is a Viber member correctly

906
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,839
And Edna offer on-site housing

907
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
I think I don't know it's all

908
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:12,031
Community colleges with that way in Columbia Missouri

909
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Have dorms

910
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,271
It's cool.

911
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
Baby lived in a hostel

912
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
I don't know man

913
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,791
With CIA

914
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
He's trying to co-opt other people

915
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Experiences

916
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,239
You know what it's like for us

917
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Right

918
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
This clip made me X

919
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Alex

920
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Is excited

921
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,087
Okay

922
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
I will say this

923
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Tomorrow is

924
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,247
Very nice fish by the way

925
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Got a big gap

926
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Tomorrow

927
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:42,143
Big guy

928
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,263
Who could it be this is Alex's so excited

929
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,479
My boy Ron coming on

930
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,063
No

931
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Is it the bells no

932
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,743
For the next half-hour where you try

933
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Charlie Sheen

934
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,311
Do dogs die now

935
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,895
And who's other than celebrities

936
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
Big

937
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,807
The politician

938
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,879
A big politician

939
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:41,279
Obama

940
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,375
Go with rainbow smash

941
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,959
He is nowhere near in plant or the energy

942
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
Oh my God I just don't know

943
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Dammit

944
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,175
I don't think they open that one

945
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
TuneIn 23rd

946
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
That's not right

947
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
It's not Papadopoulos it's no one involved in the Russia

948
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
Is it is it somebody who will

949
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
Who will not surprise me

950
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,775
After I know it

951
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,591
Is The Impossible

952
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:31,455
Alright I'm going to swing for the fences

953
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
It's not

954
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
And also

955
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
Because this this guessing game

956
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Hundred percent needs

957
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:48,863
I want to see just how low you can go while still being way too high

958
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
Sargon

959
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Avocado

960
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
No

961
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
20 question 20 questions

962
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,159
Let's play five questions

963
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Is it

964
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
Like like mainstream

965
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:25,471
What's the cure

966
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
No okay

967
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
Are they unknown

968
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,967
Yes

969
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,087
Alex is so excited about this casting so crazy

970
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,415
Big fish

971
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
3 questions

972
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Okay so it's not YouTube

973
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Sort of

974
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
Sort of

975
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
Is it

976
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Under

977
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
25

978
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
No

979
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
No no

980
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Is

981
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
Would go on the show

982
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Is it

983
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,647
No

984
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Famous

985
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Yeah

986
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,303
It's someone named Michelle.

987
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,959
As far as I can tell she's notable as being a viral video

988
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Obama Phone Lady

989
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,847
Really that would have been pretty tough for you to guess

990
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,431
Cuz I don't know what the f*** you're talking about Obama phone

991
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:43,807
Well there's that idea that Obama was buying for

992
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
Stuff like that

993
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Because he promised them phones

994
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
Stupid

995
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,839
She was in a video where she was the Obama Phone Lady

996
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,143
Alex

997
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
The big guy

998
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
Big gay

999
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
Let me let me

1000
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Ask this question

1001
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Why would he

1002
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
You say that

1003
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
It's possible that the boy

1004
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
I don't know. Maybe like

1005
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
She missed a connecting flight maybe she missed the show or something like that

1006
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,767
She's going to be

1007
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:31,167
She comes in and I believe that what she ends up talking about is a ton of like

1008
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Ideas

1009
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,495
Helped illegals vote

1010
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:43,199
Sure you did public

1011
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
I committed a crime

1012
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
Federal amounts of a federal crime

1013
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,791
Going to cover the 14th episode but I knew I could not

1014
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Possibly

1015
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
Not tell you who the person was

1016
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Could you expect

1017
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
It's

1018
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
Nothing

1019
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,031
Alex is so excited about nothing I'm terrified I don't want to

1020
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
This episode

1021
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
August 14th that's

1022
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
YouTube

1023
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,991
She's better the whole episode

1024
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Alright Alex

1025
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
Next clip Eliza

1026
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
About primary sources

1027
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,279
Course and then again manifest

1028
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,071
He doesn't understand the difference

1029
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
This is social engineering

1030
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,127
Bertrand Russell other weekend

1031
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:53,343
Sylvester Stallone

1032
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Demolition Man

1033
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
Cool

1034
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
Predictive programming

1035
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
Movies RV demolition

1036
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
1

1037
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,319
Is we will finally really understand what the

1038
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,903
They don't look forward to that

1039
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,999
Mystery results

1040
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,095
Do you think about Bertrand Russell that he's talking about is a book that Alex

1041
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,935
Severely out of context where was talking about the

1042
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,543
What would have happened if the Nazis had won World War II

1043
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,359
And became a technological dictator

1044
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,943
Any idea of the type of world that a nefarious

1045
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
Evil

1046
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
System with the

1047
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
Help of Technology

1048
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
It's not talkin about we should do this

1049
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,719
It's a thought experiment of what we could have

1050
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
Had things gone

1051
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
For what

1052
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Lucky is not the

1053
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
So already

1054
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
Talk to Piers Morgan

1055
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Say that

1056
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
He did what he did because it was right

1057
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:30,367
Later edition of the excuse

1058
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,951
Alex has another version of what happened and what lighting

1059
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
A Morgan

1060
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
You can't use as a

1061
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,711
Forever that's not new

1062
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,063
Beautiful position is tired of being lied to

1063
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,927
Well it's like Bruce winner is Bruce Banner in The Avengers

1064
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
The trick is

1065
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
He's always

1066
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:13,631
I'm tired of Alex lying to everybody I wouldn't yell at him like

1067
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Piers Morgan

1068
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
But I'm equally

1069
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
Sick of Alex Lyon

1070
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
You're acting like a child

1071
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
The reason

1072
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
Coming up with f****** excuses

1073
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
And like rationalizations for why you behave the way

1074
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,503
Is because he can't come out and say

1075
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
I knew it would get rating

1076
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,879
Even though he insinuates that he is keenly aware of it

1077
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,463
He has indications that he knows exactly what's going on

1078
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,583
Platform where I can access

1079
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,399
People who would never listen to my show of their own accord

1080
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Acts

1081
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,239
Super dramatic and interesting

1082
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,895
People talk about me and bring it even more viewers

1083
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
And if I make an ass

1084
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Myself

1085
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Piers Morgan is going to

1086
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
Show when I'm not

1087
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,439
Navigate to The Daily Show

1088
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,767
They're all going to make fun of me

1089
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
It's an interview

1090
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Disappeared

1091
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:25,311
Whose uncle is Uncle Road

1092
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
Fun stop

1093
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Cleon skousen

1094
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,407
Total weirdo

1095
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
But like

1096
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,575
Even makes the point that like in the days after Alex is on Piers Morgan show

1097
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
Larry Pratt was on again

1098
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
Hey Ben Shapiro came on

1099
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Pre-fame beds

1100
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,303
Shapiro

1101
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,703
It's about not wanting control and no one was talking about them being on but Alex being on at 1

1102
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,751
Because you made a pageant

1103
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,287
10-0

1104
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,335
Of it and that's really all

1105
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,151
He can't come out and say that because it's cheaper

1106
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Ideas

1107
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
But that's the reality

1108
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
He can he can definitely

1109
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,999
Wow so you want to raise a boy

1110
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,071
So you want to make up

1111
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,655
They got a whole series of so you want to but only for right wing

1112
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,007
2009 Alex hated Michael Savage

1113
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
You're constantly calling Michael weiner

1114
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,383
Cuz that's his real name

1115
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,407
And all this stuff

1116
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:38,015
Alex likes

1117
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
He didn't say that

1118
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,815
He said when he was on set I know that Michael Savage's

1119
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Text anything like that

1120
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,831
Road Warrior music

1121
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Knows how

1122
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Damaging it is

1123
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
To have people harassed

1124
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
Stalk you

1125
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
So this is another pillar of like his

1126
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,727
Self-defense is about his behavior Visa Visa

1127
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
Just really

1128
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
False

1129
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
False

1130
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Perceive

1131
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Then I being harassed

1132
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
And stuff like that

1133
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,735
His idea that people are

1134
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Clearly him

1135
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,319
Writing a novel

1136
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,111
Yeah oh yeah

1137
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,647
The idea that he's

1138
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,207
Able to tell why that would be traumatized

1139
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,303
Really makes it difficult for him to Discount experience

1140
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,351
So many other people have had

1141
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:01,471
Who were on the other end of his rhetoric

1142
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
Now on the other hand

1143
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
If he

1144
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
If he is lying

1145
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
And he's aware that he's

1146
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,943
As opposed to not really being able to tell the

1147
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
In reality

1148
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Then

1149
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,551
Connect

1150
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
What about peep

1151
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
Sandy Hook

1152
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,279
Albuquerque Airport

1153
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Probably

1154
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
At least subconscious

1155
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Just leave

1156
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,167
Somewhere in there

1157
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,471
It would make matches with his f*****-up brain

1158
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
It would make sense

1159
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
Position of him

1160
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Like just

1161
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,615
Absolutely not caring or understanding why this

1162
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
People are

1163
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,271
. they were lying then everybody

1164
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,087
Their house was an agent of the government

1165
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,671
Subway the same way that he is being followed or

1166
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,231
Yeah

1167
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
Just hit me while you were talking

1168
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,327
It might be a little bit unrelated but

1169
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,775
About 50 might be slightly off

1170
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Episode

1171
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,407
There is a real sense of how it's done

1172
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
Like I don't think that's absolute might be water under the bridge and taken as read by everybody who's listening

1173
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,415
Something is very strange to me

1174
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:28,511
Alex talks about what he did in Sandy Hook in the deposition

1175
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:33,631
You don't want to show now covered it

1176
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Yeah

1177
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
You know

1178
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
This Behavior

1179
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
Was a big deal to

1180
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
People on the other end

1181
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Right like that

1182
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,895
But I think spiritually he might not be lying

1183
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
I think there is a

1184
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,735
The sense that I get from

1185
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
But he doesn't give a s***

1186
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,343
The idea that people died and that it ruined

1187
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
A lot of people

1188
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,951
I don't think there's very

1189
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,255
Very little recognition

1190
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,327
That he gives a s*** about their their pain

1191
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
Secondarily

1192
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,679
How he gets so distracted by

1193
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,775
Basically talking about Piers Morgan

1194
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Really covering anyting

1195
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,711
Talkin about

1196
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,503
How there were detectives

1197
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,039
Walked into a wall

1198
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,671
It indicates to me that like what key wants to talk about is his

1199
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
And he doesn't care

1200
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
What about San Diego

1201
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:38,399
Along with his view of

1202
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
School shootings as well

1203
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
This is his first rodeo

1204
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,311
Like I assume there's wonders why it is it

1205
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,127
The Sandy Hook people are suing him whenever

1206
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,663
So many other parents have

1207
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
School shooter

1208
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
His

1209
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
Into that

1210
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,855
They're trying to take our guns

1211
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,135
So it's almost like

1212
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
It's muscle memory for him he doesn't

1213
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Tickets

1214
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,815
In the same way that correspond will have a different

1215
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,095
Concept of

1216
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,655
I'd like what super important as as

1217
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,959
Proposed Visa v a bomb going off

1218
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
You know

1219
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,799
I'm not I'm not saying that it's super weird

1220
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,127
Considering his psychology or anything like that

1221
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
Yeah that's all

1222
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Go back to the

1223
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
This time it just get vicent

1224
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
He doesn't

1225
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
That's that's more like

1226
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,391
You would hope you'd hoped

1227
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
To hear more

1228
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Somebody

1229
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
It's mostly about himself

1230
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,119
Is the opportunity to talk about himself

1231
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,679
And create a third of the heroic

1232
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Version of

1233
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
Of his date

1234
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
Prioritize

1235
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:56,479
Write me Wiley talk about her like I do want to talk about myself journalism

1236
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
So

1237
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
What are the others

1238
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,671
Is a

1239
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Sort of a betta fish

1240
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
Being able to go back

1241
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
4th and time

1242
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Is B we can

1243
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,863
And see if it's true

1244
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,727
Present a couple months back

1245
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
Talk about an episode where Alex is talking about how

1246
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
Because if it's super thick now

1247
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
Terrible sleep

1248
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
Percent oxygen

1249
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,503
Diminishing in his brain when he sleeps

1250
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,831
Yes to sit on a chair and barely able to sleep

1251
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,135
You have terrible terrible sleep problems

1252
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,207
I wanted things that I've always wondered is how far that goes back

1253
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
Become a part of

1254
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
His experience in life

1255
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
And put that possibly

1256
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Explain any of it

1257
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Deterioration

1258
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:53,823
That we've seen in the years I can't

1259
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
Say that this is evidence of

1260
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
But this next clip is a very strong indica

1261
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,455
Okay Summit Alex Jones

1262
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
Did not suffer from any of these problems

1263
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
It 2013

1264
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,463
Which is really creepy cuz I sleep

1265
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
Wake up sometime

1266
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
Paranoid

1267
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,551
Consistent throughout

1268
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,367
He used to eat can sleep through a freight train

1269
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,415
Baby wakes up a little bit

1270
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:44,255
You guys getting older that certificates is nowhere near the level

1271
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
Traumatic

1272
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Sleep

1273
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
Experience

1274
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,607
But he talks about in the present to

1275
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:55,263
His word

1276
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
Dramatic shift

1277
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
Not to say that that occur

1278
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,967
Or

1279
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
Development

1280
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
And his

1281
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
It is hell

1282
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
Pedophile

1283
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:22,399
Sure fun facts

1284
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,727
So in the early

1285
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
2000

1286
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
That would be part of the pop-up

1287
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
That V8

1288
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
There'll be a little bubble

1289
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
The pops up and go

1290
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
In 2012

1291
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,991
I didn't say that

1292
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,063
So probably going to

1293
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
Piers Morgan

1294
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
GameStop

1295
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,999
I wanted to make very clear that Alex had a very

1296
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,791
Complained

1297
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,119
Piers Morgan's cast on the next night

1298
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,959
Alex

1299
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Cure for cancer

1300
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,335
Buzz bissinger did say that

1301
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
Use language that

1302
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
Very clearly

1303
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,015
Instead Busby

1304
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,791
People wear

1305
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351
Actually heard what they said

1306
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:29,471
I just moved along episodes of our show

1307
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,895
Yep absolutely

1308
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:41,503
He's not doesn't happen much more time

1309
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,831
Let's start a fire

1310
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,671
Yep okay Bubba got that right I could see the other Gaston Piers Morgan

1311
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
Show when they were like yeah

1312
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:56,095
I'd like to see the boxing match

1313
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:02,239
Sevilla

1314
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
As Buzz bissinger comments

1315
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,383
Actually were thinking of what they wanted

1316
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,967
How to say next that they were just laughing 100%

1317
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,783
Absolutely

1318
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
Something that I was about to

1319
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Performative conversation

1320
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
Easily could explain

1321
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
Not agreeing that I would

1322
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
B shot

1323
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,607
Because they missed what Buzz

1324
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
So

1325
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,215
Whatever the case

1326
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
Complaint is making too much out of it

1327
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,287
But now on the 13th

1328
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
Beer on January 13th

1329
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,103
I think he's crossed the line

1330
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Because now Alex has

1331
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Successful

1332
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Into a

1333
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:46,527
Victimhood propaganda it no longer matches the actual

1334
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,575
Hugo's on and on about

1335
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,415
The reason they were saying

1336
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
Like that it's okay for murder to be done by officials

1337
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
That's

1338
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Is it okay

1339
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,631
You were right to complain about buzz bissinger and maybe you should have filed

1340
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Some sort of an action

1341
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
Like I don't know what would be appropriate

1342
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
To doing that and I

1343
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Situation

1344
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Do something

1345
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
He doesn't want to do

1346
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
He wants to turn it into

1347
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
To this narrative

1348
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,271
Where they're all like a great

1349
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
Great

1350
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,463
Yeah that's not that's not

1351
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
The bimbo and the host

1352
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:04,863
No no no no

1353
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,215
Oh yeah

1354
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,543
Sure

1355
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,103
He does like to eat

1356
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,175
This is why it's very difficult sometimes to agree with her

1357
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
Because the agreement that I have is the buzz was that a lie

1358
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,111
Could easily be twisted into appearing that I agree with this

1359
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,647
Yeah what he's doing now

1360
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,231
He is now taking his narrative that I could have gotten on board

1361
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,303
That I'm no longer on

1362
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,887
Manipulative you like about it

1363
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
Now in this neck

1364
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Clip

1365
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,239
You successfully transmuted another piece

1366
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,775
Next day

1367
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
Piers Morgan

1368
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,871
Gunshow which I was never on board with

1369
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
Further

1370
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,535
That's not at all

1371
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
Close to what happened on the

1372
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,679
And the way Alex has presented he's making it seem like buzz bissinger

1373
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:18,079
And the other people in the same interview were talking about nothing happening

1374
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,383
Stated earlier in the episode 8

1375
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,687
A completely unrelated different interview

1376
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:26,527
With a family member of someone who survived the Aurora ship with killed

1377
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
The Aurora shooting

1378
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
It's not like the idea

1379
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,159
He's trying to present that those two things are

1380
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
Connected

1381
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
The couch

1382
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,255
We popped and I hope nothing happens

1383
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,327
Because

1384
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:45,727
After saying that said

1385
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
He's basing this on

1386
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,639
He's not that at all

1387
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,687
Grieving man

1388
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Compassion

1389
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
And saying that you

1390
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Never won anything

1391
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,879
Write somebody who would

1392
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,439
Justified

1393
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
Wood

1394
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
Understandable

1395
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
Should he say that

1396
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Alex

1397
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,095
Deserve some sort of

1398
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
This kind of

1399
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,959
He would never say

1400
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
I don't think you could understand the emotional places

1401
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,503
Understandable

1402
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,551
So

1403
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,111
I know that we talked about this stuff already

1404
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,183
The last episode it's not new

1405
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:43,327
This one part is a fair complaint this other one is b*******

1406
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,167
We brought them up as I wanted to show you what they've become after a couple

1407
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:53,311
After it goes through the wash cycle of Alex repeating it over and over again scene

1408
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,615
This is what comes out the other side

1409
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,663
Morgan interview

1410
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,223
And then the next day Alex has the

1411
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:05,343
The sort of rough version of his police harassment that he suffered and that's her.

1412
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Over the next couple days

1413
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Thomas More

1414
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:16,351
There's no wrinkles added to it as it goes along

1415
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
To give you some sort of a

1416
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,239
Seemingly official backing of your paranoid fantasies

1417
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,543
Fictional retelling of the events

1418
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,591
And that's what comes out the other end

1419
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,175
Complaints about the next day show on Piers Morgan

1420
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
Yoder's

1421
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,039
Diversion

1422
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,831
Immediately give it a couple days

1423
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,903
Tumbling cycle comes out the other side of Polish Rock

1424
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
He's going to move forward

1425
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
The perception

1426
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
Set

1427
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
Did they want to shoot

1428
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
They were

1429
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
Insinuating they hope my kids

1430
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,423
Which

1431
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,287
Thanks for that out of our mouths

1432
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
Years Alex

1433
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,895
You would not expect

1434
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
Is not old country

1435
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:09,599
Call Me Maybe

1436
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,559
I'm going to call

1437
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,055
Keep very much owns The Big Chill

1438
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
That's super weird

1439
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
Sort of out of Alex's

1440
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
Range

1441
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,807
Footsac

1442
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
Always

1443
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
The hips don't lie

1444
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,727
Sakura is informed me of that

1445
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,519
Weather

1446
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
Shakira Hips are not

1447
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,127
But your hand

1448
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,759
And pray

1449
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:14,879
Alex Bragg

1450
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
Like the last action

1451
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:28,447
Craigslist

1452
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:38,943
I believe there is about that

1453
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,063
You should not be publicly

1454
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,135
Out of line with

1455
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,743
But I think it's also really in

1456
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Khepera's life

1457
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Actual movie

1458
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,399
Because we would do that too

1459
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
It is much as movies aren't real

1460
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Expressing is

1461
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Is

1462
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,359
Just touch it

1463
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
Enmeshed

1464
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
Inability

1465
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Present reality as reality

1466
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,503
It's so messed up

1467
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,087
What's up

1468
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:33,215
Movies

1469
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:37,311
Baby in their lives are like what you imagine movie stars live for life

1470
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
Or a movie about a fluid

1471
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:44,223
As opposed to Alex being like The Bourne Identity

1472
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,319
Very much

1473
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
The show

1474
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
You start

1475
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
Call

1476
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
They're all pretty boring

1477
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975
I'll bet against this call from a lady who ran into

1478
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
Dianne Feinstein

1479
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,047
I believe Gloria Allred

1480
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Abortion rally

1481
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
She doesn't have much to say about it

1482
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,823
Alex editorialize

1483
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
It's on her

1484
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Celebrity site

1485
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Sure

1486
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
Sure

1487
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,807
90 or 91 I was in Burbank California

1488
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,879
At 8 I was

1489
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:28,767
Abortion rally and I persuaded Matt Dianne Feinstein and Gloria Allred

1490
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:32,351
And they are exactly what you said hard as nails

1491
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
You name it

1492
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
Really can't believe it

1493
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
It's still

1494
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,295
You promoting this

1495
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,831
So f****** hard

1496
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
Cannot be the Obama phone

1497
01:19:55,135 --> 01:20:01,279
Fireshow almost

1498
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
Theory

1499
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,911
Billy Corgan connecting flight something like that

1500
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,703
12

1501
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Also by the way this lady

1502
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:15,104
With her complaints about the Gloria Allred

1503
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
Is not a negative

1504
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,784
When I was a kid

1505
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
Basketball team

1506
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:28,928
They were there

1507
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
Jose outside

1508
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
Jumper artist

1509
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,840
Three-point man

1510
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:45,824
Stole three pointers from everybody in the big eight

1511
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
The big eight

1512
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
Is that guy tough as nails

1513
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:56,320
Cuz you scrapped you small and mix it up a little bit

1514
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:06,560
Small person who's still getting in there

1515
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,144
Yes4all

1516
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,912
Shortcoming

1517
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,704
Absolutely

1518
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
Like that

1519
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
She's tough as nails

1520
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:27,552
So I agree with this lady just application

1521
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
30

1522
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,744
Everybody knows the demons are also tough

1523
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,048
Sure that's 121

1524
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
Second-story demons

1525
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
Demon Steal Your Girl

1526
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:51,104
Episode of a holding pattern

1527
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,664
Alex is so excited about his

1528
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Piers Morgan

1529
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
How much attempt

1530
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
He's getting from

1531
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,808
It's so much of it is very negative

1532
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Like the Conan

1533
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Booty

1534
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Northlake

1535
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:15,424
But Jon Stewart is talkin about the idea that

1536
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,960
So what's going on

1537
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,520
Because I replace the clip of Alex

1538
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,336
Screaming about

1539
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,416
Oh I see what's going

1540
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,256
Your fear of a possible dystopian future

1541
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Is

1542
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,096
Stopping us from having a conversation about artistic

1543
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,120
Being present

1544
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,400
I told there's like

1545
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
It's a lot of

1546
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,448
Negative attention

1547
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,984
Alex is getting

1548
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,264
But he still able to

1549
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
To use it

1550
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:58,432
Needs to do well for the follow-up

1551
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,712
To Alex there's a cert

1552
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
Percentage that Argo

1553
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,320
Misconstrue all of this

1554
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,344
Coverages

1555
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
Dammit

1556
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
Right

1557
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,464
His victim narrative all the more effective

1558
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
The Daily Show

1559
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
Jon Stewart has a point

1560
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
Play

1561
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:25,312
The Daily Show coverage and then scream about a little bit

1562
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,944
Yeah literally has nothing to lose if you're

1563
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
Listen to Infowars you're not watching

1564
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
The Daily Show every night.

1565
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,344
Look at that liberal crusader

1566
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,136
It's interesting to see

1567
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,672
Here in this time when

1568
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,488
So much is going on

1569
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
Hook

1570
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,072
The conversation

1571
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
What's going on

1572
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
The world

1573
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,888
Just be Alex

1574
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
To just

1575
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,288
Just suck his own dong

1576
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
Grotesque

1577
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,640
Ask navel-gazing

1578
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
It-it's

1579
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:04,736
Really bizarre

1580
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,784
A little bit in preparing this episode

1581
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
Because I

1582
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,600
Really invested

1583
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
In this 2013

1584
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
Yes.

1585
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
A little bit

1586
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
Literal masturbatory contest

1587
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
I mean

1588
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,376
It is what it is

1589
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:28,032
I can't handle it Monday show

1590
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,688
Like I don't know what I'm going to do

1591
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
How many weeks

1592
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:38,016
Lose my mind I just

1593
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,392
We'll see what happens

1594
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,440
But I'm excited for

1595
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Think we got through

1596
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Most of them

1597
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Alex's

1598
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,120

1599
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,800

Twitter

We will review

1604
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
All those things

1605
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,536
Tell afraid to eat one teach one

1606
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,096
Something along those lines

1607
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,680
Alex

1608
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,240
Imaginary

1609
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:39,456
Play virtue of non-existent never killed anybody but one guy who has is that imagine

1610
