My bright spots and a realization that

10
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
I've been I've been listening to a fair amount of some podcast

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848

00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,456

21
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
It really feels like that's like a balm that I can I can put on my man

22
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Glue guy

23
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,760
He's like a Phil Hartman he's got that kind of like straight man energy

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
He's also incredibly hilarious

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
Really really going to exploit my platform

26
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184

If you were called then

38
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
While back

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
I told you about a pair that

40
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Delicious

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
I got two pairs for you never run by the way

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,424
Where I'm going to join us but my partner's mom

43
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Both decided that

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
We got to do something for this so they ordered me a

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,640
Rite Aid they realize how to do something about your love upstairs

46
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,480
They had it they were inspired into action

47
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
So they ordered me

48
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Burger place

49
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
That has grape

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
To the point where I am

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
I can't eat it

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,048
Looks too much like the tart pan

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
I don't know what to do with this pair

54
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
I mean it's going to be

55
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
And then you'll recall that I said something about how my brain was functioning

56
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
And black dragon Queen Christy sent me any

57
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920

Double bright spot

Things are looking real bright

62
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376

00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400

102
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,535
Once we get going you'll understand why I had to cover that temperature

103
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
The first years out of context drops

104
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Today Show

105
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,703
The devil a cool man he's not what gives you the hot cheerleaders in the

106
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
And the party in the fun

107
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,615
Actually I thought that was specifically

00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Try and empty

109
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
Picture and he's the one who

110
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Foregoing

00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,439
Pacific things yep that's always been my tracks

00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
This April 1st episode

118
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
It was an April Fool's episode

119
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
I would admire the hell I was

120
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
There's a number of things that go on that you could interpret as being like

121
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Fedora but it's not

122
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
Like this this this could be an April Fool's gag

123
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Blast freezer

124
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
Particular subject

125
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
That robbed

126
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
The Rustic root

127
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Pestering me about

128
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Last night and today

129
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Reddit

130
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
And it is the Smoking Gun of smoking guns of Smoking Gun

131
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,247
Is it Green Eggs and Ham

132
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Next hour I'm going to cover this big story

133
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Right

134
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
I don't do that

135
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Give you just pulled out the big news

136
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
I don't have some fanfare

137
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
Like a 20th Century Fox intro

138
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
British newsreel

139
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
People don't

140
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Care to just

141
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Becomes part of the background

142
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Ambient noise

143
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
They actually

144
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Condition

145
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
To the tyranny of evil

146
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
You know I almost did just go off

147
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Are for a month

148
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Infowars

149
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
And then if I came back

150
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
We might be able to save the

151
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
I hate you so much

152
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
See what I mean April Fools

153
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
That should have ended with should I be saying any of this perhaps

154
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
I have the gun the smoking guns and Smokin Guns

155
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
Disappear for awhile

156
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
That's an interesting idea

157
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Disappearing like he's going to the rafters.

158
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,751
If you love something let it go

159
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Just face paint Crow Facebook

160
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
A brutal Galaxy

161
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
Bruce Lee's grandson

162
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
So he doesn't

163
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
He doesn't disappear from

164
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
But he does have he does do what I would say is the next best thing

165
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
What am I told you

166
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
I have

167
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Document

168
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
From John Haupt

169
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
They plan the whole attack

170
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Planned

171
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
SARS attack

172
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
Planned the Ebola attack planned

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Becoming 19 attack

174
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Plan through vaccine

175
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
The brain damage you and give you all timers and sterilize you

176
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
And then how they're even going to blame the politicians

177
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Now they even set up President Trump

178
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
To do it

179
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
I would be

180
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Smoking Gun

181
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
I'm imagining

182
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
In your hand

183
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Mail it to me

184
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
I'm not going to cover

185
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
I'm going to put together

186
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
And I'm going to come in here Saturday and I'm going to take

187
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943

188
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
2 p.m. central Lee should have it ready

189
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
After hour until I go live Sunday

190
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Easter

191
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
4 p.m. Central Standard Time as I always

192
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:47,167
What is it that's amazing I've got to go get gun through

193
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
Saturday should I can't handle that type of relationship

194
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,455
I'm sorry that leave for me Isaac

195
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Wow

196
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
That is

197
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Ridiculous

198
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
You can come on Saturday that kind of

199
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Kind of presentation is

200
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,255
If you're listening in the audience you have to ask yourself

201
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Why

202
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,375
What kind of fuel persons to lose

203
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
The organisation be like we have proof of ever

204
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,287
Everything that is going on in there trying to kill everybody we're going to wait two days

205
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
Oceans do weight with it with information that they're not

206
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
We got some bobtail s*** about something that LOL

207
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Absolutely not the document that Alex is talking about is a 20-17 scenario exercise called the sparse

208
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,751
Pandemic 2025 to 2028 Camaro for Public Health

209
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
Wrist Communicator that sounds like the Smoking Gun

210
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
This is essentially very similar in structure to the Rockefeller one Alex erroneously

211
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Recalls operation locks

212
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
In that beat Johns Hopkins exercise began with the selection of two important

213
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Variables like

214
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
I could dictate what challenges could arise

215
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
In a possible future

216
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
He is Alex real or is Alex not real

217
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
In this exercise the two variables work with varying degrees of access to information technology

218
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,215
Levels of fragmentation among social political religious ideological and cultural

219
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,847
Where is the Rockefeller document explored all four of the possible Futures that were based on the variables they chose

220
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
This document focuses instead on just the one

221
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
Is that the most challenging terms of medical communication

222
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
Okay so there are

223
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
More

224
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
Positive simulations that could happen with those

225
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Two variables

226
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Creating a matrix

227
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Sephora scenarios

228
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
This paper is entirely about the worst possible scenario

229
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,239
What the other ones are really know what they are the real bummer of a scenario.

230
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
It's a scenario that is for an exercise for medical communicator

231
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Challenges or they decided Woodway

232
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Most interesting challenges

233
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Is the one that they use

234
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Excellent sorry I just wanted to talk

235
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
This was the possible future that they called

236
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
The echo chamber

237
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,511
Which represented the scenario where there was widespread access to information technology and quote

238
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Isolated and

239
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Highly fragmented

240
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
2 communities

241
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
Reading over this document it's really fascinating how there are a number of similarities

242
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
The real world in the scenario that was laid out in this exercise

243
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
The real world novel coronavirus was called sars-cov 2

244
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
Where is the scenario illnesses called spars Co

245
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,015
Ultimately these similarities are all things that make sense

246
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,623
Given that the possible future was laid out by public health experts who would be trying to make as realistic

247
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Scenario is possible

248
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
So participants

249
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
Explore the communication challenges that could arrive

250
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
In the event of a problem

251
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Look Health Emergency

252
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
In a world where everyone is online

253
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
And a large segment of the population lived in a slightly

254
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Different reality from each other

255
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
One of the problems that we keep running into it these scenarios like this document in the Rockefeller one

256
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Are there well-written and engaging

257
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
They contained a ton of details

258
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,527
Flush out the world they're trying to depict it seem like more of a prediction than they intend to be

259
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,647
Is John's Hopkins an area relies on a template laid out by Jay Ogilvy and Peter Schwartz

260
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Send their 2004 paper

261
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767
Titled plotting your scenarios published by the global business

262
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,167
In this paper Ogilvy and Schwartz try to help businesses and organizations understand how to best structure a scenario-based

263
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Exercise

264
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
In order to maximize its

265
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Impact in terms of

266
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Of the participants

267
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
Being able to learn about how to deal with new circumstances and manage

268
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Exchange

269
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Okay so these guys are done

270
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Yes

271
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
Yeah that's what these guys do

272
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
The strategy of using a scenario made

273
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Is explained in this paper

274
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,695
This is what both of Johns Hopkins and Rockefeller exercises used

275
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
Two key factors Lathan could affect

276
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
The possible Futures they wanted

277
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,095
Explore then that list is whittled down to two Central Factor

278
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
These factors are plotted on a matrix

279
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Which could go in one of two directions

280
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
And that creates

281
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Four distinct combinations of factors

282
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Floor right

283
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
An example that's given in this paper is about looking at possible futures

284
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
For education

285
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Where they choose to use

286
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Hierarchy versus participation

287
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
And inclusion versus X clusion

288
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
The two main actresses that were the most relevant to their exploration

289
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
This created for scenario

290
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Hierarchical and inclusive

291
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Hierarchical

292
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Exclusive

293
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Participatory and inclusive

294
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
And participatory and exclusive

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
Each of these possible realities looks vastly different from the others

296
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
So it's not too hard to jump from there to scenario building

297
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
And creating evocative narrative

298
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
The characterize each of these so participants could more easily relate

299
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Do the challenges that eat

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Possible

301
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
Future Wicked

302
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
That's exactly what Ogilvy and Schwartz discussing their introduction

303
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Listen to this

304
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
To be in effect

305
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
To planning tool scenario should be written in the form of absorbing convincing stories that describe a broad range of alternative futures

306
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Relevant to an organization

307
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Success

308
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Copley construct

309
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Did Bolivar

310
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Bull plot

311
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,103
Help managers to become deeply involved in the scenarios and perhaps gain do understanding of how their organization

312
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Can manage change as a result of this

313
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Experience

314
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,015
The more involved managers get with scenarios the more likely it becomes

315
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
They will recognize their importance

316
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Less obvious implication

317
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Moreover scenarios with engrossing plots

318
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Could be swiftly communicated throughout the organ

319
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,791
Innovation and will be more easily resemble remembered by decision-makers

320
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
At all levels of an

321
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
And if the CBC rolls in 18 or higher

322
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Ogilvy and Schwartz are business Consulting

323
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Send this technique

324
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,455
Using scenario-based exercises is a very common one above organizations that want to explore how prepared they are

325
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
Two-Face potential challenges that could up come up

326
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Expectedly or unexpected

327
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,439
These scenarios work better if they're written as compelling and engrossing stories and as we've learned

328
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
Alex has an incredibly hard time differentiating between reality and fiction

329
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Think about the problem

330
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
These are these guys they recommend that people quote

331
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,191
Invent catchy names for the scenarios

332
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Saying quote

333
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
When your managers feel the hot breath

334
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
The crisis

335
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
They should be able to recall the appropriate scenario by name

336
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Dan if you recall

337
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
IFC

338
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,479
Suggested to sign in.

339
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Here's the problem though

340
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
I have also

341
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Suggested they go outside of scientists

342
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
For naming

343
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
Yeah but then Alex also talked about how like THX

344
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
It's World 138 or whatever Israel

345
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,863
That's not a problem

346
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
What's the weather this week

347
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
Well this one is called the echo chamber

348
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Okay I'll call it

349
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,895
The shity room fell right you won't forget the shity room now that's true that might work

350
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
This technique though creating these names that you remember it

351
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
It's a good strategy for scenario-based planning but

352
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
The flip side like you have pointed out is that

353
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Names could be

354
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,695
Explain Mary usually

355
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Step is a perfect example of that

356
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
Jessica catches Mario name

357
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,863
Which is apparently so catchy that Alex has built a gigantic

358
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
Conspiracy around it now I rename it bummertown

359
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
1

360
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
You remember it

361
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
To nobody's like

362
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
Oh they're using bummertown to defeat the bicycle

363
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,807
The bummertown scenario all over again the bottom line here is that this document is none of the things Alex

364
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Claims that it is

365
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,255
Also is 89 pages long so there's no way I believe for a second that Alex's Reddit

366
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
He talked a little bit more about it here although he said he was going to wait until Saturday

367
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Talk about it

368
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,567
Right right right

369
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,663
Basically anyone taking exact same for all designer the same thing

370
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,503
He's going to have neurological disorders within one year

371
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
Most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10

372
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
That is not

373
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
In the options

374
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
That would be very serious thing for Johns Hopkins

375
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,887
Enterally CR2032

376
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Depicted in the exercise

377
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,727
Some of the outbreak begins in 2025

378
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,615
Houses making s*** up because he knows no one's going to read it and he's got all the elements there that he needs to lie about it

379
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Indian rages it's

380
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Your gold deep

381
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Just rif

382
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Every now and again I like to point out when Alex

383
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
This makes it abundantly

384
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,415
Play clear that he thinks that he's fighting literal demon sure because

385
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Is everyone needs

386
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
To keep that in

387
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
Recalled that this man

388
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
60

389
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Right you know who authored this report it wasn't the center of Public Health. To Johns Hopkins

390
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,103
For the Morningstar you bet he's a master of Public Health but actually got a degree honorary

391
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Well

392
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Obviously this is not a human intelligence running this

393
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
After that

394
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
Generals.

395
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Intelligence agencies

396
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
Because everybody knows

397
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
Everybody knows fake low-res a flying saucer

398
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
I'm talking about interdimensional

399
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Hell-bent to destroy us

400
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,823
Naturally

401
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
And it's not

402
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
Fallen Angel

403
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Operation

404
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
Alright honestly might have more respect for low revs

405
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,647
Pictures of Alex

406
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,999
Yeah I would say that I am Orkin

407
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Convinced by the Loch Ness Monster

408
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
Picture photo

409
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Interdimensional beings are

410
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Controlling

411
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
The plan that's not even happening

412
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
So Alex lies a little bit more about this topic

413
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Ken's report

414
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Hell on Earth is going to be released

415
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Total collapse

416
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Giant John Haupt

417
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Implants

418
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
That our operation

419
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
John Hopkins runs the whole thing

420
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Shopkins

421
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
All spelled out

422
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
Says here just like I surmise by 2030

423
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
You did not surmise population is

424
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Dead or living dead

425
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Totally

426
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
And then we're going to have to

427
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Take care of people

428
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
When did the good people to survive

429
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
Will have to join the globalist in Exterminating

430
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Who's left

431
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Because I'm out of control

432
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Whoa

433
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
Alex is making that up

434
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Bicknell

435
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
Big pass on that one kind of

436
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
The passage that

437
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Guess most

438
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
Closely resembles what he's talking about

439
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:00,704
Quote while the federal government appeared to have appropriately addressed concerns about the acute side effects of corvax

440
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
That's the thumbs up

441
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Esparza's Skarsgard

442
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Help 9

443
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Largely unknown

444
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,528
Nearing the end of 2027 reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge

445
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,416
After showing no adverse side effects were nearly a year several vaccine recipient slowly began to experience symptoms

446
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Such as a blurry vision headaches

447
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Head numbness in there

448
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Extremities

449
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,608
Due to the small number of these cases the significance of their association with korvax was never determined

450
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,008
Have a writing in 20-30 longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH of the beginning of the vaccination program

451
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
Have not reached the next round of data

452
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
The formal analysis of these symptoms has not yet

453
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Been conducted

454
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
Furthermore these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients

455
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Those in high-risk population

456
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Including those of underlying health conditions

457
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
Making it increasingly difficult to determine

458
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
The extent to which these symptoms are associated with that

459
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Exclamation yassi that's good dungeon master

460
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
But I would

461
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Expect Alex

462
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Westwood Arvada.

463
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
You haven't been vaccinated will be forced to kill the rest of everybody

464
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:15,200
Do you imagine scenario involves a small number of possible unforeseen side-effects in was actually and that's

465
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Deployed to fight

466
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:23,904
We just heard John Hopkins

467
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,256
It's a complete picture that is just created out of thin air from his imagination

468
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
The story that he's telling

469
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Literally has no can

470
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,144
Into the primary source that he's pretending to cover

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
I can't wait until we get to Saturday

472
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
They had days and it's one of the most in common

473
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Play Forever that you heard I'm going to get to this Saturday

474
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,248
Handle this Saturday but I'm like alright alright we'll see you then

475
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,552
Alright I'm going to stretch

476
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
Your knuckles a little bit you do a little right here we go

477
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Can I got to say

478
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
I don't know

479
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Who here

480
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
He's got for this

481
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
This Saturday show

482
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
It's him Rob do and some dude named Mike

483
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
I don't know who this Mike dude is

484
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
But he is a weirdo

485
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Holy shiitake

486
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
Not to be believed

487
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
Alright so anyway Alex

488
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,440
Infinite resources and is it a million years old

489
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Satan's interested in an information

490
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Probably trip

491
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,288
In the 40 days and 40 nights that Satan tempted Jesus in the desert that most of what they talked about was Alex

492
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Well window when

493
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
Dude do you know what we're going to have eventually have to

494
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
To deal with

495
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,832
Arcadecloud got like all the Angels you know turn against God or whatever it was

496
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
Was information Warfare

497
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
Convince them that their freedom was stolen by an infinite creator

498
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
Who's mostly about vaccine

499
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Anyway Alex is fighting cancer

500
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
The operational shut

501
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
Of the planet

502
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
As we know it

503
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
And the decision has been made

504
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
The Earth is to be completely sacrificed in the

505
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Main mission they say

506
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
Used to destroy the Earth

507
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
And it only out of that metamorphosis

508
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Creature emerged

509
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
That's what they've been

510
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Old

511
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Universal

512
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
Cold it is a ethos it is a religion

513
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
They rebelled against God

514
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
And so I really don't even know Alexa

515
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Did not

516
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Think I'm going to have to just

517
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Andis over to somebody else

518
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
This stuff too big

519
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
If people don't know about this

520
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
I can't believe

521
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
This man

522
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Set alarm

523
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
That didn't seem

524
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
Oh I had a

525
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:39,488
The space baby from 2001 Space Odyssey

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,376
Is out there

527
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
It's going to grow into a thing

528
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Stuff

529
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Ensure

530
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,360
The go Bowser trying to give birth to Satan to walk on rice

531
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Right

532
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Right now that's a mean that's a real bummer

533
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
I caught a kind understand wanting to go to the woods

534
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
The best of times I want to go to

535
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
What would be a bad place

536
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Because Satan's all about the

537
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
The fire is on fire

538
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
You want more like a black top

539
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
Sure move into a park

540
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:22,752
Great Glass to make

541
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Greeley Great Windows

542
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
This could be a good thing

543
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,480
Document that he's not going to cover until Saturday

544
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
And they all know what's bull

545
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
It's just every

546
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
Part of it is a lie

547
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
And you're wearing the death

548
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
You're wearing the

549
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Admit in the John Hopkins report

550
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
They gets an added bonus

551
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Pneumonia

552
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,632
Of the Mask we're just going to really increase their deaths toll

553
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
DIY work mask

554
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
Ask does not appear once when they were John Hopkins archetypes

555
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
In the scenario bacterial pneumonia is a condition that appears to

556
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
To be connected to the invented virus sparse

557
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,712
But Alex is completely making up everything you say

558
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
Document wow pretty great

559
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
That's pretty great

560
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
I do like whenever you

561
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
You can toss in something that isn't even mentioned

562
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
That's always good

563
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
So

564
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Who's fighting the devil

565
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Alex's

566
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
Bob covered himself in the armor of God

567
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
That means

568
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Talking about the bike

569
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,520
And

570
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
No this is Thursday

571
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,104
Maundy Thursday

572
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
No idea

573
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
I can't remember what the there's stairs

574
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Good Friday right

575
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Palm Thursday

576
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
Palm Saturday Wednesday but that's different

577
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
So don't worry about it where you don't know the week

578
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
I forgot

579
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Anyway Alex also has forgotten

580
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Some things about revelation

581
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
Play the Bible

582
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
No flesh would be spared less God

583
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
No flash

584
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Which would have been

585
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
None

586
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
It says the rich men will sit under the mount

587
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
Mattresses under the mountains

588
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Beating themselves in the head

589
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
So angry that they

590
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Surfside

591
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
SelecTrucks right

592
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Chosen your side

593
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Yeah I like Trump right

594
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Chance

595
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Weird

596
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
Delicious

597
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Weird

598
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
So if the Bible did people would live under mountains thing about the elite

599
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
Globalist Ivan underground bases

600
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Hear it

601
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Yeah

602
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,168
Unfortunately Alex is leaving at a very critical part of the verse that he's poorly reference

603
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
This is from revelation

604
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
6 vs 50

605
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
15 quote

606
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
Then the kings of the Earth

607
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
The princes the generals the rich the mighty

608
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
And everyone else

609
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,944
Both slave and free hidden caves in among the rocks

610
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
Accident Mountain everybody hit

611
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,088
It wasn't just the rich people it was a whole plethora

612
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Evoke

613
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,208
It's pretty much everyone trying to hide from the opening of the 60s

614
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,072
I like much like Alex just writes fanfiction about the nefarious documentary covers as

615
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
He does the same thing with the Bible

616
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Even like a religious

617
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Everything is just a prop

618
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
Yeah I forgot to use

619
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
Want to know

620
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
If you were fighting the devil that is

621
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Would be your best

622
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
His knowledge of the Bible

623
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,344
Sure I seen that in the various

624
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
Norris movies

625
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Yes

626
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
Indeed we have so Rodger is coming in

627
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Again

628
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,864
Great which we saw on our last episode

629
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,704
Interesting. I got really weirded out by this

630
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Rodger Stone

631
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Delete a national movement to run for president order support Trump

632
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
Regardless

633
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Flint

634
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
I just need to

635
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
We should draft Meme here on the show

636
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
We can't wait for Trump

637
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
We can't wait for this Santa's

638
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,192
We need General Flynn who is a good man in a patriot or sales going on

639
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
We need him to do this out Rogers a dental appointment

640
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
Bauer

641
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,736
Episode the conversation was about trying to draft

642
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
Twin or Gates

643
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,416
Sure

644
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
And Alex is just

645
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Pretending with that wasn't a conversation

646
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,096
No we never defended that guy he's a real Criminal

647
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
Dial mean not to his credit

648
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
But Rodger is still like

649
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
He's innocent he's being set up

650
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,592
Good Rodger move boy has a deflated

651
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,992
Quickly spent over an hour on the last episode

652
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,064
Love you just like to party

653
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
We had opposed

654
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Be Breezy got this one and we decided you guys

655
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
Did not commit any crimes.

656
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
Someone got bad kept going the way it look like

657
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
We're going to go in

658
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
I can walk away from this at this point

659
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Going to go to buy

660
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,688
So I got the sense that like

661
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
Rogers f****** with Alex a little bit which I

662
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
Second kind of enjoy

663
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Dustin may

664
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Play a secret

665
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
It's on a class letter

666
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,256
My email doesn't work anymore

667
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Gmail block

668
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Bono's really is

669
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
The full weight of the government works against

670
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
What's the country to imploded

671
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Alright

672
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
Email doesn't work

673
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
Rochester

674
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
I don't know why Outlook isn't working right now

675
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,600
Occam's razor tells me Rodger is f****** with Alex

676
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
Do we get another headline

677
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Such a quote

678
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
Refuse to wear covid

679
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Clearwater Florida

680
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
Even a conservative City

681
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,872
Star teaching

682
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
Critical role

683
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
Naturally there's a story about Clearwater High School and honestly if I were to use a different word than real

684
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Educate no manual

685
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
Kingsbury easy

686
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,096
Students who do not wear a mask when it is required to refuse to

687
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,168
To do so should first be re-educated

688
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
If after the re-education occurs they do not

689
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Apply for student

690
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
Administrator

691
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,360
Should be contact should be

692
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,432
If not done so if behavior is not change

693
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
I'm in this whole thing goes away

694
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,320
The word re-education is up in the means a lot of different things in different

695
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Context

696
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,904
For Alex the word means, he's taking kids to

697
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
The camp to do nothing for

698
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Clockwork Orange

699
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
In this context

700
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,632
It's really clear that what they mean is that if a student is refusing to wear a mask they should be given a chance to better understand why I'm asking him for

701
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Boarding school room settings

702
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
Before any kind of disciplinary actions even

703
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Considered

704
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,824
This is essentially what the kids get a warning

705
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,736
The right-wing blogs are covering the store use this quote but seem to leave off what comes immediately after it in the school's plan

706
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
For the new Academic Year

707
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Not wearing a mask when

708
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,648
It's required is not a disciplinary matter but rather a health and safety

709
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Concern

710
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
Administrators will contact the parent or Guardian for

711
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,792
Support if the refusal continues the principal must

712
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
Contact the area superintendent

713
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Option

714
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
Which include administrative placement into one of the other learning option

715
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:25,312
Displacement is a non-displaced replacement and is based on the health and safety needs of all students and staff

716
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,152
Do the same document literally says that students who refuse to wear masks

717
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
I won't get in trouble

718
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
And if it's something that can't be resolved

719
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
Then accommodation will be made to allow them to

720
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
Continue to go to class remotely

721
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,464
That seems like going above and beyond to cater to people who refuse to wear masks in public gathering settings

722
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
Re-education so this is somehow about critical race Theory or something

723
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
And is really well-thought-out

724
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,984
And kind of consider it and perhaps overly sensitive you know

725
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
But it is better than my plan of if a kid decides not to wear masks you go to his house and scream and his parents faces

726
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
Until I leave you alone forever

727
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
Comfort a codified into a rule

728
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
Better that I wouldn't use the word

729
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
Give Less meat for our

730
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
Rodger comes on after the dentist

731
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,792
Do not talk about my Gates

732
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
It's much much

733
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
The day before

734
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,704
Surprise eggs General Flynn to announce that he's running

735
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,800
President did Rodger trying to explain to Alex that there's a game they need to play

736
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
Rodger saying that if they're going to do this

737
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,968
The first thing they need to do is gather massive amounts of data about the people who would support Flynn

738
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,320
And then they need to somehow get around all the social media bands with all this s*** heads like Alex have

739
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
That limit their reach

740
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Right

741
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,696
It's a farce of an interview and it seems pretty clear to me that there's going to be

742
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Free summertime to coming down the line

743
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
Try to replace Trump

744
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,072
But Flynn has the figurehead of the Infowars Idol cult

745
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Rogers trying to subtly and plant the idea that

746
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
When is like Eisenhower

747
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,496
He's a military hero of the people need to coerce

748
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,312
Into running for office because it's his duty to the country

749
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,176
Rodger seems to realize that the only thing that's going to work for someone like Slender the fully

750
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
We realize storyline

751
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Porsche the campaign

752
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
And it's character work so that kind of Arc

753
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Regardless of how disconnect

754
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Reality it is

755
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,256
It's the same thing they did was drop pretending that he was a successful businessman would never had any interest in politics who won the presidency on his first try

756
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Thrive

757
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
When compared to reality

758
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Bulshit but it's

759
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Compelling storyline for the bass to enjoy

760
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Flynn being a

761
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,752
Candidate whatever similar complete bulshit narrative

762
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
If it were to get off the ground but could be effect

763
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,128
I am wild out wild it out by the idea that

764
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
That anyone would want

765
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Anyone Who Had

766
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,992
Any command during the Iraq War

767
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
That's weird also pledged Allegiance McEwen.

768
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,512
Immediately disqualifying like I don't even care what your politics are

769
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,864
You were involved with commanding in the Iraq War you are already a

770
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Failure before you even

771
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,216
Began you should maybe take a seat you should go away

772
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
So Rodger wants

773
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
The build-up to the subtly and softly

774
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Where is Alex's a little bit list

775
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
They're just going back

776
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
Conforth about how Flynn needs to go on the attack immediately that's what Alex

777
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,784
Rodger comes back with

778
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
Helen finally Alex's just had enough

779
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Here's the deal got to do it

780
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
He knows it

781
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
And

782
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
And

783
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,840
And so he's going to run for president I drafting him

784
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,632
The American people

785
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,984
Quiet event to 10,000 people here 10,000 people there 1,000 there

786
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,056
Quietly has that are packed out

787
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
Need to tell him you're doing it and I'm not being

788
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,200
They want you and I in jail because they know we'd

789
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Felt like fire

790
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
What's wrong

791
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,576
They know that we're not afraid they know we got lightning in a bottle and they know that

792
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
Lightning don't strike the same place

793
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
That's how

794
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
We'll invite guys.

795
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Wait what

796
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,608
Obviously I could sell off the sunset right now it's almost ready to buy me off like that I could Snap My Fingers

797
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Billion dollars

798
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
But I'm not selling Humanity out

799
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
He needs to listen to you he needs to announce soon

800
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:16,224
Alex is sick of the bulshit many watts of the hero figure 2

801
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
I got wrecked

802
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
It turns out without his

803
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
Indubitable platform

804
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Trump s*** talk

805
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,584
Walking doesn't work yet. We all that good as the center folk exact

806
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
Alex Jones

807
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
Need to be someone else's hype man

808
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
Totally that

809
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,568
That person I'm hyping is absent now.

810
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
I'm really flailing

811
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
Mead

812
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Dad

813
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
You are one

814
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
Hundred percent correct step that is exactly what's going on

815
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Flipaclip means nothing

816
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,416
But I just thought it was kind of interesting to hear Alex describe

817
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
The plot of Romeo and Juliet

818
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
I think he'd get some of the Beats right okay

819
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,168
I'm really really interested in that I'm going to be honest this is the first time in a while I've been like

820
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm going to be on the edge of my

821
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Literature recap

822
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Reading a

823
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
William Shakespeare

824
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
Play

825
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,480
Read before you know you turn the page and Romeo and Juliet

826
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,296
Tell me you read their parents

827
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Problem

828
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
By the end of

829
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Commit suicide

830
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
You know the play

831
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Starrett

832
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
Well

833
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,888
I mean I mean he's not wrong

834
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
Exist

835
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,360
Venerated play for hundreds of years because of that plot synopsis

836
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
Skeleton is there

837
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
There's a ride out of the kill themselves to parents

838
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Read before

839
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:03,232
It does not sound like you've read it before Easter

840
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
Map of the Leonardo DiCaprio version and then woke up at

841
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
You're one of these literature major types though like I'm from the streets right

842
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Surely there's more to it

843
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
I disagree

844
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Okay well that's fair

845
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
That's fair

846
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Yuca

847
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:33,440
Could cut out a lot of those dogs a classic the classic tale of people meeting

848
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,280
My family is being mean

849
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
It has it does have an arc

850
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah so Alex cares about the theater cares about classic

851
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
Literature

852
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Money

853
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
You don't know why I feel so upset

854
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
I've never cared about money

855
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
I would make enough money to fund the operation Atlanta

856
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
But now I can tell you going to the Future

857
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
You'll be able to Stave this off a little bit longer but not longer if you do that

858
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,007
This is a world civilization ending event

859
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Yeah they are talking about

860
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,943
Everyone vaccinated is going to have Alzheimer's including children

861
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
Box

862
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,879
I knew this was all coming

863
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
This is scarier than my film endgame

864
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
And they roped

865
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
Oh God do they get royalties for that

866
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
Don't even know what to do with this

867
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Displeased

868
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
God

869
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
Babies

870
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Wwoof

871
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Weird God

872
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Dear God

873
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:02,527
So just a quick fact check there's literally nothing in the Johns Hopkins report about anything close to what Alex is making up here

874
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,111
The robots cleaning up their body stuff is just from Soylent Green

875
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Enjoy

876
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,463
The word Alzheimer's doesn't even appear in the document

877
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,863
Public health communication challenges that could come up in the event of a disease outbreak

878
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
Comically stupid for Alex if there's a chapter on how everyone's going to be dead robots

879
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Clean up our court

880
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
So made up

881
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
Really weird flourish for them to do

882
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Just be like oh and also the vaccine

883
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Gene causes Alzheimer's

884
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
That's a clause

885
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Also Alex loves money

886
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
You should be

887
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
Swimming in a Scrooge McDuck

888
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Dial yeah the April 1st show Alex interviews James O'Keefe about some footage apparently God of Emma

889
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
In poor condition

890
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,655
This falls under the heading of a subject I care about and it's a political issue that

891
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Memes

892
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
It's something people should be paying attention to

893
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
But I do not trust the person delivering this message

894
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Fuchai is act

895
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Singing good faith

896
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
Oh no I don't

897
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
I reserve the right to ignore anything James O'Keefe

898
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Also f*** him

899
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
Let's move on

900
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
April 2nd

901
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
Yeah 100%

902
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,903
I could have seen that being an April Fool's episode doubt the way Alex is like

903
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,487
Until Saturday and Eli's a bit about it little touch-and-go on it

904
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Existence

905
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
Does Joe has Rodger and Alex

906
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Serta pretend

907
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
The conversation didn't

908
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Involve Mac Gates Today Show

909
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
So we get to the second

910
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
The tone is completely change

911
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
Everything is totally different

912
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
These headlines

913
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
Infowars.com

914
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
Structure bill

915
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
Includes 20 million to destroy highways

916
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
Racist

917
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
If you're not aware of this

918
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Choking

919
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Here's some of the headlines

920
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
December

921
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Cold

922
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
Highway removal in a black neighborhood

923
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
One person calls

924
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Acrostic

925
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
One person calls

926
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
White House

927
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Singled out

928
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
Announcing the highway is all the jobs in

929
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Will be destroyed

930
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,279
This is so evil ladies and gentlemen

931
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,375
We covered this back in the endgame coverage so I don't have to go out too much on the subject

932
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
In case Alex is listening

933
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
The history of the placement of highways in

934
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Incredibly racist

935
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:35,103
The fact that he's laughing at the idea and mocking it really only reveals that he has no idea about the history of that subject

936
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,711
No one's calling for all highways to be gone so there can't be business or travel anywhere

937
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
The conversation is about how the ways that highways have been constructed in the past often has been done with absolutely no regard for minority

938
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
Communities and often to their

939
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
There's tons of primary sources Alex could read up on if he's injured

940
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,559
Listed in the devastating impact that practices like Redline

941
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,631
Communities of color in this country in terms of social impact

942
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,239
And the destruction of economic power over Generations history of redlining

943
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Cargo in Naruto

944
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Fuct

945
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
Stupid stupid bigger

946
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
Who doesn't actually care about reporting accurate information or depicting reality shows

947
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
He's just

948
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Protecting

949
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
The Notions of whiteness

950
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
And I am

951
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Demanding

952
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
That Joe Biden

953
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,439
Destroy all of Illinois portion of roots

954
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
I want it all gone you don't want anymore on my route

955
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
No more historic Route

956
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
66 I want all the

957
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,655
The science Aiken down

958
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Dave

959
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Asphalt

960
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,519
Dug up I have no skin in this game

961
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
I don't have a car

962
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
66 is what I wanted crocodile

963
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Does the Dan Ryan survive

964
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
So

965
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Tyranny

966
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
Yep you heard of it

967
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
It's speeding up

968
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
And has been speeding up over time

969
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
Doesn't sound 100% wrong

970
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Were there

971
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Journeyman

972
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
This is what they like

973
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Like to do

974
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
And they're doing it to us

975
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
Raw

976
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Domination

977
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,127
And we sit here with our open Society model

978
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
Does it move show

979
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,319
10 years ago we were going 5 miles an hour

980
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
5 years ago we were going

981
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
50 miles an hour

982
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Who that's fast

983
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
3 years ago we were going 100 miles an hour

984
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
Well if you think about the time in between these speeds that are a very slow Excel

985
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
Alteration parabola

986
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,407
Two years ago we were going 200 miles an hour

987
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,967
We were going 500 miles an hour

988
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:54,367
And now we're going 10,000 miles an hour down the rattle that's because that was

989
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Million miles an hour

990
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Billion miles an hour

991
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
Gilman

992
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
Confidence going

993
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
People submit and like

994
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Domino's

995
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Killed everybody

996
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
John Hopkins

997
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
The collapse is going to work

998
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,967
Either going to be so many brain-damaged people from these vaccines

999
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
Natural

1000
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,039
Big Mass Reclamation centers

1001
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
Green

1002
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
What's people

1003
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,207
You signed the paperwork while your son and your daughter in

1004
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Your mama

1005
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,535
20 years old party results 6 years old

1006
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
Cuz I could have just given him something

1007
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Something that

1008
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Wipes you out

1009
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
They wanted to be something that

1010
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
Waze on everyone sorrow in the

1011
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Painting

1012
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
Medical system

1013
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Everything out of you

1014
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
Squeezing your drive

1015
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
. none of that is a in the dark

1016
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Yeah

1017
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,375
He describes something from soil

1018
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
Green and then says that they

1019
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
Satan the document like in Swahili

1020
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
That's real convenient that it is it is really helpful for movies to tell you what is in the duck you

1021
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
But you're talking about

1022
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Yeah

1023
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,247
Yeah

1024
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,551
I could describe any movie and then just

1025
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,879
Exclaim that is what a document says investigate to like

1026
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
It doesn't matter

1027
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:38,047
The Rockefeller report on 30

1028
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,887
10 Going on 30 and body swap

1029
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:47,775
We're all going to swap with our I read that document out of the aspirin into the

1030
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:54,175
The two top body-swapping major Bravo

1031
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Right

1032
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
But the people who don't learn those life

1033
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,319
It's going to create robots in the street

1034
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
Cleaning them up displaced within other people

1035
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
Immigration inside a body

1036
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,351
That's a lot of new regulations

1037
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,703
I appreciate it

1038
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
So Alex isn't released

1039
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Supporting gays

1040
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
As much

1041
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,871
Mostly because it was a

1042
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Aggressive

1043
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
At the end of March

1044
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Those last episodes

1045
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
It was

1046
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,831
Yeah over-the-top what I didn't mean to say that

1047
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,159
And defensive Matt gaetz I meant to say it's okay if you f***

1048
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:42,559
Nope that's not good either.

1049
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
So

1050
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
Rodger was

1051
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
Still defending Alex on the April 2nd episode

1052
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Sort of

1053
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,127
Supportive but haha

1054
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Little bit

1055
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,503
Gates with no proof why he's got to be removed

1056
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,879
Old girl $1000 one time

1057
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Dona Lolita Express flight

1058
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Caribbean island

1059
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
An hour-long it's not a seventeen-year-old girl but

1060
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
It's okay

1061
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Cuz

1062
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Pembroke Road

1063
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,871
What there's a moral mean

1064
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,199
I'm out of the bus like that

1065
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
That's not what happened

1066
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
Also got new experience

1067
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Of course I said

1068
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
Go ahead your lies

1069
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Of course they don't

1070
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
Still meeting

1071
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,303
To bring himself into it

1072
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Unnecessary

1073
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
I want

1074
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,983
If he says something like if it's real I'll throw them under the bus I want a cow

1075
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
Countdown clock are right over there

1076
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,615
Just like Tad

1077
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
The different town

1078
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,991
Before I sit this is the dismount

1079
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,599
Skulls and get this one caller

1080
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
This is sort of

1081
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
The call wasn't

1082
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
Interesting but he said something that I wanted to play as well

1083
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,047
This is the type of person who believes in Alex's show

1084
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
To give you a nickname

1085
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,151
The club of Rome was founded in 1968 in the UN began in 1940

1086
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
85

1087
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
Because they knew the club of Rome with

1088
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Right

1089
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
I mean you understand like there's just this

1090
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,647
Did this is the sort of thing you're not understand

1091
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,975
Do you do you want to leave the club of Rome he's speaking about

1092
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
How tall boy

1093
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
Is Romulus Auto

1094
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
And the wolves

1095
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:59,775
I mean like okay so the Antichrist needs to get its power and that's why they made the um

1096
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
13 years later the club around

1097
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Was found dead

1098
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
Images of make any sense

1099
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:11,807
Anyway alexsa in between calls with rainbows a little bit about how God wouldn't it be so great if they you you

1100
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,367
Us and Russia became best friends

1101
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Medically

1102
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
It's over

1103
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Go to Country

1104
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Dominate the world for good

1105
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
A new golden age

1106
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
Last week

1107
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
That's not

1108
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Works

1109
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
The Dragon

1110
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
We all know what I'm told

1111
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
What

1112
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,199
So now the war that now the holy war that unfolds is between the United States and Russia

1113
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
I guess so

1114
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,295
But also this is a real

1115
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,599
Strong argument of predeterminism

1116
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
No freeway

1117
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
Seem like that

1118
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,719
It does seem like weird is it dipping into

1119
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:56,351
Calvin territory this is a this is a horrifying are you

1120
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Revelation

1121
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,191
Yeah you do geopolitical for us and Russia teamed up with

1122
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:04,287
Dominate the world but we know from Revelation that's not good

1123
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
It's such a f******

1124
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Cop out

1125
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
F*** you

1126
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Fair enough

1127
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
How dare you

1128
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
The Book of Revelations doesn't also include like

1129
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,295
100 years

1130
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:21,439
The prep time for the Antichrist arise there is a revelation about how the devil's 10 years by

1131
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,255
So well that was an interesting thing for John to add

1132
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,839
So we get another car and this dude is on every

1133
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
F****** episode

1134
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
He calls in all the time

1135
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
The dude named Carlos

1136
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,007
But everything that's going on right now isn't a con

1137
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Christianity

1138
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,591
What are you obviously I'm going to cover the John Hawkins.

1139
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,943
People sick

1140
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
It's a society collapses

1141
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Incredible

1142
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,575
What is there big endgame why are they so Savage

1143
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
What are they moving ahead with something so incredibly dangerous

1144
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
Giant mask rhymes

1145
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
Because

1146
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
People doing

1147
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Good Friday

1148
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Think about it

1149
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
Worldwide Moving

1150
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
By individuals

1151
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,079
Automatically

1152
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:18,527
I don't know who this dude gets on everyday like almost everyday

1153
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,111
It it makes me think that either he has a priority number

1154
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:26,463
Sure they don't get that many calls

1155
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
All the f****** time

1156
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
And Alex

1157
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
Why is a Bazaar level of deference

1158
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
For him

1159
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
For quite a while

1160
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
Carlos

1161
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,775
Seems like a guy that is in the

1162
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
Yeah yeah

1163
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,383
I don't know maybe maybe he's just letting people talk

1164
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:50,015
Too much now because he he's he's get another color and I will say that you let this guy talk too long too long

1165
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
Little bit too long

1166
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,623
Not not the same kind of problems with Harrison Smith

1167
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,903
When people talk too long

1168
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
This guy just sound

1169
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
A little bit Sovereign citizen

1170
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
We have some really big

1171
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,351
Issues

1172
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
The original

1173
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
You know this whole thing

1174
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,639
Is about the legal fiction

1175
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
The Congress created to our birth

1176
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
At work

1177
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,807
Representing.

1178
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
So

1179
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:30,975
So we're operating under color of law

1180
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Color of law

1181
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
And until and unless

1182
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
We

1183
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,375
Refute their presumption

1184
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,215
Stop representing. All caps name

1185
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
Find an explanation of

1186
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:49,663
Dacosta Colchester killed

1187
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Send notices

1188
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
Beautiful brother Stephen

1189
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
Beautiful

1190
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:00,927
All caps when you spell the man named Dan

1191
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
Beyond that standards

1192
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,727
The original post office

1193
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:17,567
That all wars are Wars between post

1194
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,127
Did you not know that there has been

1195
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,943
100 years secret war between post offices

1196
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
Ever since one guy

1197
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,551
And his horse knocked over another guy's horse

1198
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:31,903
Started the great post office War feel like probably there were

1199
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,695
Earlier times some feuding

1200
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,975
Queen

1201
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:41,119
Between Capital primitive post office

1202
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,167
These days

1203
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
Lil Debbie

1204
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
Big Show sucks

1205
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,823
This episode is not good

1206
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
The image of

1207
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
Just a regular post office driver

1208
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
Just drive it other with the

1209
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
Door open on the

1210
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,063
Wrong side in your life isn't that cute you guys are driving

1211
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,367
They get out and then there's suddenly attack

1212
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
Another post office

1213
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,255
Frozen into the open window

1214
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,887
Boys jumping UPS close

1215
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
So

1216
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:21,311
Alex has

1217
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Who's another reporter baby

1218
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
Find the skies

1219
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Voice

1220
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Incredibly annoying

1221
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
He's on to talk about the Border

1222
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
And

1223
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,415
Talk about everything is

1224
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
I'm here

1225
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,535
Just started and where I turned it off

1226
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,631
But also some of the culture War stuff

1227
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,447
Things that are going on as they put us onto this

1228
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
Virtual economy

1229
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,055
Yeah I mean I'm pretty sure your viewers are familiar with

1230
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,127
Bad baby you know she's the catch me outside girl that was on dr.

1231
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
You're feeling extremely viral

1232
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Totally depraved

1233
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
She made an onlyfans

1234
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
I got to go

1235
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:08,671
Don't know I don't know what good is going to come of this conversation about the cash me outside girl

1236
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,071
I don't care you know that somebody in a viral video has an onlyfans

1237
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
AccountNow

1238
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,167
Did I know

1239
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,471
Goodbye

1240
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,335
I don't I don't care to listen to you I guess of a best-case scenario

1241
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,895
Shame someone for being a sex worker

1242
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
Like I don't give a

1243
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,991
How dare you

1244
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
Have fun

1245
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,647
I hope no big deal 300 Yelp

1246
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,183
He's on to talk about the Border

1247
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,767
Culture wars if someone has an onlyfans account

1248
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
I'm mad about it

1249
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
I have to leave

1250
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
I can't

1251
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
I'm not going to take you seriously

1252
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:55,263
That's a dynasty level offense if I had a glass of wine in my hand I would throw it in that guy's face her burial service

1253
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
The temerity

1254
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
Yeah and plus

1255
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
I mean realistically

1256
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Saturday's just

1257
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,015
It's right around the corner

1258
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,087
You've got an hour of

1259
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,903
Meats and Gristle

1260
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
When to start off

1261
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,999
With with Alex

1262
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Discovering

1263
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
The

1264
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
John top

1265
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
The most

1266
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,679
People are informed of heard about event 201

1267
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,983
They've heard about operation lockstep

1268
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,567
They weren't about Crimson contagion they weren't about diseases

1269
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
And the UN drill

1270
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,199
But have you heard about summertime

1271
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,015
2025 20:28

1272
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,599
It is all of those plans together

1273
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
But not set

1274
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
In the near future

1275
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Previous drills were

1276
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
But set

1277
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,119
Add a few more years in the future

1278
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Super Bowl 20

1279
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
25

1280
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
2028 with 2020

1281
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
The 20

1282
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
23

1283
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
And it is

1284
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Exactly

1285
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
What's happening

1286
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
I love the idea that Alex has a job Johns Hopkins an area to pick things exactly as they're having a real-life is Superman

1287
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
Imposed on a different date

1288
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,903
Also nothing funnier than

1289
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,255
It's not a little bit the teacher interview

1290
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,887
Future ideas in the near near started

1291
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,167
That's a bad dismount

1292
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:32,543
Real life just a little few years off of a few things

1293
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
Intentions of the Hopkins exercises messaging issues around a drug that was believed

1294
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,271
The effective against bars called

1295
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
Tallow severe

1296
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
Severe

1297
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,879
There wasn't a drug that the government was trying

1298
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
Make a push for the treatment of covid in the way of the medic

1299
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,999
Local community Gets behind cattle severe in this exercise

1300
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
Maybe RAM does averre possibly but

1301
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
I mean

1302
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
There is like

1303
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,423
But his messaging hydroxychloroquine

1304
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,519
Pushed hydroxychloroquine so hard

1305
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,127
It doesn't fit for this and I don't think that room does of your does either in terms of

1306
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
The waves

1307
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,943
Depicted in this the exercise

1308
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
Read to me this is a black one really big problem with

1309
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
The scenario match

1310
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
Real world history

1311
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,927
Second backlash to cala severe begins in February 2026

1312
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
64 months into the outbreak

1313
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,023
Like when a video of a child projectile vomiting

1314
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,327
After taking a dose goes viral online

1315
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,143
This did not happen for months into covid

1316
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
Even metaphorically

1317
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:37,567
3rd in May 2026 a made-up rapper named bz suffers a public

1318
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,383
When trying to promote sparse treatments to his audience

1319
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,991
Sweating a people who volunteer for vaccine trials to participants in the Tuskegee experiments

1320
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
This did not happen in the real world

1321
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,135
Exhibit a in why scientist do become rapper

1322
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,695
Are fictitious rapper's name

1323
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
BZ

1324
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,607
Examples of things like this not happen in the real world exercise

1325
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:03,167
Because the point of the events that happened in the scenario is

1326
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
To create situations

1327
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,751
We're messaging challenges would arise

1328
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,287
But the exercise participants

1329
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,567
Could reflect on how fast

1330
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Respond

1331
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,223
The inclusion of a situation like this rapper making a public gas in this scenario doesn't make sense out of

1332
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,319
When you don't see this exercise within the context of why it exist

1333
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,855
It seems really weird

1334
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:27,487
But when you understand that it's designed to assist medical Communications professionals brainstorm the ways that

1335
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
They might need to respond to various events in a crisis

1336
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
The picture makes

1337
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,911
At the same time that bz makes his comment

1338
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,799
That's the fictional former president Jacqueline Bennett gives a noncommittal answer about whether or not she would give her grandson

1339
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Palace of the year

1340
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,687
Which creates a similar but slightly different messaging Pro problem for the exercise port

1341
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,991
Dispensary

1342
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
Anyway the point is

1343
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,087
A bunch of things that happened and is very differently

1344
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,903
Name is Imagine scenario that have happened in our real-world Opera

1345
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,999
Houses just trying to pretend everything is the same because it's more Fun and Profit

1346
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
For him but

1347
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
It's all made up

1348
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
So icy

1349
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,911
Because he's supposed to be a

1350
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
I was I thought Jay-Z

1351
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:12,031
I mean but the very public gas would suggest more of a Kanye

1352
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:19,199
Circumstances are they are they saying that Kanye is going to Taylor

1353
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
Swift covid-19 the context of the scenario exercise bz is one of the people who

1354
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,623
Who is enlisted

1355
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
To help get messaging out

1356
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
About the safety of the tree and then he said George Bush doesn't care about black people

1357
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
Enlisted medical community

1358
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
This document my friend

1359
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Is a timeline

1360
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,519
Short is what you need to understand

1361
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Actually timeline

1362
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,079
But a few years off

1363
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
EmbroidMe or near to basically you just transpose

1364
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
The beginning of the outbreak

1365
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
2

1366
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
The outbreak in the document

1367
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
You can tell what's going to happen

1368
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
In the future

1369
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
And unfortunately

1370
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
We are six months away from

1371
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,695
Now here's what's

1372
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
We're about 13 months into the simulation

1373
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,119
That again it's not really a simulation are using that

1374
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
Cavaliers

1375
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Operations

1376
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,215
Case I get caught with the documents I just say

1377
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
It's part of the grill

1378
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
Operation

1379
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
Also.

1380
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
Classic by Health agent

1381
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,503
They say that within six months to a year of people being inoculated

1382
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,783
Experimental

1383
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
GMO

1384
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
Gene therapy

1385
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
That you will have massive brain damage

1386
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,951
And spongiform encephalopathy

1387
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
She basically

1388
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Prion disease map

1389
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,887
Good Times

1390
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
Six months to a year for

1391
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
Don't worry it's b*******

1392
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:51,615
In the exercise there's potential basis for a vaccine discovered in the form of an animal vaccine for

1393
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,919
Respiratory virus developed by a company called

1394
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
GMI

1395
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:01,087
This condition was similar in many ways to sparse so researchers began looking at whether or not it could be effective for human

1396
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,903
What are the initial downsides was that quote

1397
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Data provided by gmic

1398
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,743
Suggested that the vaccine was effective at preventing

1399
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,815
Illness in cows pigs and other hoofed mammals

1400
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:15,167
But internal trials revealed several worrisome side effects including swollen legs

1401
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
Severe joint pain

1402
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
Ed Encephalitis leading to seizures or death

1403
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
Right and cows learning how to do

1404
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,359
In this scenario in May 20th

1405
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
27

1406
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
A group of parents

1407
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,223
The size of the group is unspecified they sue the government

1408
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,039
Because they believe that their children got Encephalitis from the vaccine

1409
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,855
The claims are not presented as necessarily Acura

1410
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,415
It just more detail added to make this a more

1411
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
Real scenario

1412
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
Since his mirrors real world

1413
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,999
Anti-vax folks

1414
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,047
The challenge to the message

1415
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
Virginia's required for medical communicate

1416
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,399
The scenario does say that quote

1417
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
A showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year several vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision

1418
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,335
Headaches and numbness in their extremities

1419
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,895
Do the small number of cases these significant

1420
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
Today sociation with corvax was never

1421
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Determined

1422
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,551
As of this writing in 20-30 longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH

1423
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Beginning of the vaccine Nation program

1424
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,903
Have not reached the next round of data collection

1425
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
The formal analysis of these symptoms

1426
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Has not yet

1427
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:10,975
Been conducted

1428
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,047
Furthermore these cases arose from the initial cohort effects

1429
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,863
Recipients those in high-risk populations including those

1430
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,911
With underlying other underlying condition

1431
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
Making it increasingly difficult

1432
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
To determine the extent to which

1433
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
These symptoms are associated with that

1434
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Text Nation

1435
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
I read this earlier but I wanted to read it again

1436
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
And because it just brings up an important point

1437
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,199
And that is what these elements of the scenario it's

1438
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,991
It's left intentionally open end

1439
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,271
Yeah because it exists

1440
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Suppose a question

1441
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
The

1442
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,111
It's not to depict a reality that actually exist

1443
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,695
In that scenario how does a person in a position of medical messaging

1444
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
Respond

1445
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,255
How do you convey confidence

1446
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
Stone the medical side of things

1447
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Well still acknowledging certain

1448
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Uncertain

1449
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
These are the sorts of questions of this story arc is meant to

1450
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
To bring up

1451
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:56,799
Because Alex knows better and he's a psychic he's realized that this is actually the globalist

1452
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
Estimating that they're going to give everyone mad cow disease

1453
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Encephalitis

1454
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
Is really just a the animals act

1455
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Axion right

1456
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
The GM I created

1457
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
In the end it's

1458
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
Encephalitis and animals

1459
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
And then there's some

1460
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,367
Parents who allege encephalitis

1461
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
It's not actually proven in the

1462
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
In the case of the

1463
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
And that's maybe the most important question for the study to ask

1464
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,607
Which is how is it that we can tell people

1465
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Honestly

1466
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
We don't know

1467
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
And at the same time reassure them

1468
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,495
That

1469
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:31,615
They can trust or to Turtle Point out is

1470
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,175
Exploring ideas of how to beat

1471
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
Compassionate

1472
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
About the Unser

1473
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:41,087
Cuz it's alright it's alright feeling for people to have and how do you

1474
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
How do you mix

1475
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
That compassion about the uncertainties

1476
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951

01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
Spell science

1479
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
The challenge

1480
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
That's why you do EXO

1481
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Chris Isaak

1482
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,911
Yeah my message would probably not be good I would be more

1483
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
Sing like listen

1484
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,727
We know Pat

1485
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,335
Public education has failed you between 1st and 8th grade at

1486
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
Least you wouldn't make it through the app

1487
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Fixes connecting this

1488
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Study

1489
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
And he's found

1490
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
Right so they say encephalitis

1491
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
Scenario right

1492
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,439
And what what that's like the zika virus right

1493
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
I just mentioned to you spongiform encephalopathy

1494
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
Prion disease

1495
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
Microbiology infectious diseases Journal

1496
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
Covid-19 rna-based vaccine

1497
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
And the risk of prion disease

1498
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
That was put out

1499
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
In 20

1500
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,311
21 by prestigious scientist

1501
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,151
Whenever you hear Alex say that a claim is being made by a prestigious scientist

1502
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:42,783
That means he has no idea who the person is immediately

1503
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,623
Known quantity but he wants to elevate this claim

1504
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,903
Because it works well for him

1505
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:54,559
Share this claim that the covid vaccine causes prion disease was entirely on a non pure review paper by a guy named Jay Barker

1506
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,655
No one agrees with his conclusion and he is not a prestigious scientist

1507
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:03,775
According to USA Today quote in 1999 he claimed the influenza vaccine cause

1508
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Type 1 diabetes

1509
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Acclaimed

1510
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,871
Proven by Johns Hopkins University

1511
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:14,271
Institute for vacuum places whenever there's a vaccine

1512
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:17,599
That needs to be smeared with IBS

1513
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,695
So now Alex is there he's rolling deep though with

1514
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
With crew

1515
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:26,047
Decode Beezy

1516
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,119
Play Daddy's got robbed deuce

1517
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
So Rob do isn't

1518
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
Studio

1519
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,495
The corporate representative Rob do

1520
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
He's just

1521
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,847
Blown away by this document

1522
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,919
Yeah so the parallels on this are

1523
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,527
When you looked at 911 and you saw the parallels that

1524
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,831
This is got the same thing in it

1525
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Massive power outages you got a male and female president

1526
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,207
The president who's a male

1527
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Stops

1528
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
After a few years artist

1529
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,095
Female who she's only in for one term then she leaves

1530
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,167
Then the male president takes over we kind of have that going on

1531
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,519
So first of all biting Isn't step-down So this isn't actually a similarity at all

1532
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,567
Exactly like that where it's happening

1533
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
You don't

1534
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,479
I don't know if the Infowars universe is just so convinced that it's going to happen any day now that they've just decided it's already happened but

1535
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
This is just a similarity in Rob's had

1536
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,855
So in this scenario the president does name Randall Archer

1537
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
He previously been the vice president daughter Jacqueline Bennett

1538
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,463
She didn't step down

1539
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,327
She just decided not to run for a second term after being president from 2020 to 2024

1540
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,631
At which point Archer ran and won

1541
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
You guys

1542
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
As you were

1543
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,335
You still actively involved being an adviser but was not up to seeking re-election quote to do to help

1544
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Concerns

1545
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
This is the case

1546
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:51,039
In the scenario because it creates an interesting Dynamic where there's a new president but also a fully-functioning an intact staff at the department of

1547
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Health and Human Service

1548
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,135
Interns with the exercises designed to explore this make

1549
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
Text total stats

1550
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,719
Essentially former president Bennett exist as a

1551
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,535
The prop so she can be a character that makes up media gas

1552
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,863
Where should give that noncommittal answer about Calla severe

1553
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,167
The character that said should be a beloved

1554
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Public figure

1555
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,287
It works anyway.

1556
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
That's too weird

1557
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Telephone for president

1558
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
Looks great in order to make that scenario work

1559
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:20,223
She would have to just had one term and ideally she shouldn't have

1560
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,503
Just lost an election

1561
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,575
Seems like the best way to get to that story beat we just

1562
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Sequel Electric

1563
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:33,279
So the Gap would carry so much weight that they would be influenced by it while at the same time

1564
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,631
You couldn't lose an election and have everybody be able to be weird

1565
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,215
Yeah you don't want to be their current president because it makes

1566
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,591
The other specific that Rob uses this power outage

1567
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,151
He's in the scenario

1568
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,455
There's a massive power outage in the Pacific

1569
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:54,783
Northwest just one week prior to the rollout of the vaccine

1570
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
Which doesn't match up with

1571
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,367
What Rob wants are two in the real world sure

1572
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,719
He's trying to compare that to the Texas outages which happened well after vaccination programs

1573
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Began our reality

1574
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,351
Again it's important to understand why this specific detail is included in the X

1575
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
Exercise

1576
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
This is all about medical messaging in a public health emergency so this power outage was added to the scenario so participants could

1577
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,567
Or what methods they might employ

1578
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,127
If they didn't have access to things like social media

1579
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,479
With a massive power outage one of the main methods of communications is less effective

1580
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,319
You need to continue helping the public through so what do you do

1581
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,879
This is super clear from the exercise if you read it

1582
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,207
But if you just want to make random connections I guess you could do a Rob do is doing

1583
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
That's really embarrassing

1584
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
What it says in the

1585
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,911
Quote all communication about the vaccine rollout was published in electronic form

1586
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
Consequently many individuals in the affected areas

1587
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:50,079
Where initially unable to access information provided by state local and federal health authorities

1588
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
Regarding korvax dispensing

1589
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,967
Immediately after this there are study questions for the participant

1590
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
In the document

1591
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,015
Like quote

1592
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
Well greater

1593
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Use of electronic media open

1594
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
New opportunities for broad Outreach

1595
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,463
What Communications vulnerabilities exist that could impede communication efforts

1596
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
Violetta

1597
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
Tronic Media or the other question

1598
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Quote

1599
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,655
How can Public Health communicators remain flexible when multiple disasters occur at once

1600
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
In their paper about designing scenario-based exercises

1601
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:22,335
Ogilvy and Schwartz discuss the need for stories that follow various

1602
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,175
And one of those common archetypes is Crisis and response

1603
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:30,271
This plot element is about introducing a big problem and then the participant

1604
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,039
Let's get to respond

1605
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,647
The paper discusses an exercise they ran with shell that followed basically this

1606
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Exact same path

1607
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,231
Quote first comes the scenarios Christ

1608
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:45,887
Initial signs of environmental degradation lead reputable scientist to conclude that an environmental disaster is faster

1609
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,983
A few leading governments and companies change the way they do business

1610
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,823
Disasters begin to occur in countries they could not or chose not to adapt

1611
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,103
And there's public outcry

1612
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
The playing field

1613
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,479
The organizational operating environment is suddenly dramatically alter

1614
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,807
The Innovative firms that learn to make difficult changes in their beds

1615
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,111
Practices to avoid environmental degradation

1616
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,159
Are now positioned to become market leader

1617
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,743
In the Johns Hopkins exercise the outbreak itself is the initial

1618
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Crisis

1619
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:16,351
Then things like a power outage in the Pacific Northwest or the video the kid vomiting

1620
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
Represent new crises that

1621
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,423
The participants have to deal with

1622
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,263
This is the context of what Alex and Robber lying about no makes total sense

1623
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
There's no way to read that document and not

1624
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
Understand but that's what it is

1625
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
That's so funny to me

1626
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,687
That they missed

1627
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
The most important

1628
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,039
Of having that kind of power outage a week

1629
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
Before the vaccine rollout

1630
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
Which would just beat simply be like

1631
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:44,511
Okay an astonishing number of people are going to think that God is punishing us for this vaccine

1632
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
How do we deal with that

1633
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:49,119
Or did you are all the proud boys accounted for

1634
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,655
Is this witches

1635
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
People are going to ask us

1636
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:56,799
Why God punished us with this power outage before the vaccine

1637
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,359
You know what that isn't in the exercise but I think

1638
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,687
Subject

1639
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,247
It was made in 2017

1640
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,855
If it was made today that might have been irrelevant messaging question

1641
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,879
But yeah okay

1642
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,695
Beautiful organism meteorologists are witches

1643
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,231
What do we do about that

1644
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:21,631
It's interesting to me that like this is how Rob do starting it out he's talking about like these similarities

1645
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,679
One is not a similarity at all

1646
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
In that fight

1647
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,495
Hasn't stepped down and it said where

1648
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
Even if he did

1649
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
It doesn't match

1650
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
The scenario

1651
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
Kick it in the

1652
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,151
In the exercise

1653
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Completely

1654
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,831
Text total sites that a power outage would be in there

1655
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
It creates a border

1656
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
Teaching moment about

1657
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,439
Using non-electronic Rapids

1658
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,767
Everytime do goes to a diner he has failed

1659
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
The

1660
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
What are the three different

1661
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
Picture

1662
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:58,751
Geodude ever gotten one of those I get cereal boxes placemats it doesn't know shut up another great idea

1663
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
Okay okay

Cook meals around or whatever it is

1666
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,063
I have a new idea

1667
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,927
Steiner try and figure out puzzles better way to eat

1668
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
Overcooked

1669
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,767
How old is defeo

1670
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:28,447
Interesting Lee

Don't waste your time on

1672
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
Please do so Alex

1673
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,823
Steps to starting up reading

1674
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,847
The the

1675
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
And this is fun

1676
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
I love this

1677
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Let's go ahead

1678
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
And again here

1679
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,015
Here is the project team

1680
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
Who is Ronnie

1681
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,343

John Hopkins Bloomberg School

1684
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Appublichealth

1685
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,999
The team

1686
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:52,767
Talk to Janice

1687
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:57,887
It's a five senior associate with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health security

1688
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,167
A professor from Texas State

1689

Masters of Public Health candidate

1690
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,775
From Columbia University

1691
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,615
How do you get any of those things without a proven

1692
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,663
Open track record of top you Dennis

1693
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,247
Alex has no idea who any of these people are

1694
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
You know who they are

1695
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,327
Directly affect interact with these people know who they are Columbia University grad student

1696
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Generation eugenicist

1697
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Store

1698
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:36,031
Earlier there was a squirrel a weirdo coming up Nate Mike

1699
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:40,639
Mike the swirly weirdo don't know who this dude is

1700
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:46,015
Employee might be Harrison Smith roommate sure anybody but he is

1701
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
Tennessee Tractor

1702
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
Weird

1703
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
Oh and alive

1704
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
Okay

1705
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,183
I know this can be found inside of this far so I can work for work

1706
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,743
After showing no adverse side effects

1707
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
After nearly a year

1708
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,583
Vaccine recipients slowly began to

1709
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
To experience symptoms

1710
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,959
As Time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated

1711
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,751
Claims of adverse side effects

1712
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,775
Began to emerge

1713
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,591
As investigations grew in intensity

1714
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
Several high-ranking

1715
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,711
Officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down

1716
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,247
And withdraw from government

1717
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
They're setting up the health

1718
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
Officials and the politicians

1719
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
Take the Fall For This

1720
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
What Mike is reading here

1721
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:27,231
It's definitely from the document but he's made a classic Infowars moved here

1722
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
Havanese taking two unrelated passenger

1723
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,351
Just from the texts and combine them pretending they're about the same thing

1724
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,399
In order to lie about this document

1725
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,703
The part about people experiencing side effects

1726
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,775
After years from chapter 17 it's on Page Six

1727
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,615
The second part about government official stepping down as chapter 19

1728
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
It's on Page Six

1729
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
57

1730
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
It's completely unrelated

1731
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Previous chapter

1732
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,735
First conversation about possible side

1733
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,831
Here is the paragraph about the government officials info

1734
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
Quote

1735
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:58,463
After action reports government hearings an Agency Reviews following the pandemic were too numerous

1736
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
This account

1737
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:04,351
Emergency funding appropriated by Congress to fight the disease became available partway through the course of the pandemic

1738
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,935
But federal state and local public health agencies struggle to manage

1739
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
The procedural requirements

1740
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
Suspended that does sound familiar

1741
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
As a result

1742
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:15,872
Significant amounts of emergency funds remained unused as a pandemic while I'm down

1743
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:22,528
Has the investigations grew in intensity several high-ranking officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down and withdraw from government

1744
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
In order to quotes

1745
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
Spend more time with their family

1746
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
The investigations that are causing uses

1747
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:33,792
Investigations are causing these imaginary officials to step down or not related to possible drug side

1748
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
Clearly about mismanagement of funds

1749
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,192
If this guy's read the document as he's presenting himself as having done

1750
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:44,544
Then he knows fully well that the two passages he just read as if they were one paragraph

1751
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,336
Are actually two completely different

1752
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Sections of the document

1753
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,432
If this document actually said what he wanted it to

1754
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
He wouldn't have to lie like this

1755
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
In order to make it look like it

1756
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
Met his

1757
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
Needs

1758
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,832
This is bulshit weirdo Mike

1759
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,392
Yeah that is funny that even in the Johns Hopkins

1760
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
Report it's like listen we all know at least

1761
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,768
15 to 20 Saturdays are corrupted

1762
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
We're just going to

1763
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,352
Put in that some of them adequate

1764
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
I mean it's it's

1765
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,936
I think that the

1766
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
Scenario

1767
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Paints

1768
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,056
A very realistic portrait

1769
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
Things that you could expect might happen

1770
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:23,968
We'll deal with another one of them that robbed you thinks is maybe Wizardry

1771
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,320
A little bit later but I don't know

1772
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,648
Ferris options that are made and then also some ones that are like

1773
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
That's a little silly

1774
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:39,840
But they're all in service of what the document is for

1775
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,448
Exercise medical communicators rise to various challenge

1776
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Now

1777
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:52,128
Think that clip right there where Mike is reading two different sections as if they were the same

1778
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,688
Because when he's talking about these b side effects

1779
01:21:54,944 --> 01:22:01,088
Event says as investigations grow in intensity and that's mentally the audience very clear

1780
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Split those quote

1781
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,392
Yeah but then combine

1782
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Send them together to form a

1783
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:09,536
Single quote believe that the investigations are about drug side effects

1784
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,072
And that's how they're

1785
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,352
Going to set up the politicians

1786
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Take the fall for that

1787
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Has nothing to do with

1788
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
He has to know.

1789
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:22,592
And this is the point at which any reasonable person would just be like f*** this absolutely misrepresenting

1790
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
And there's no way that that is an axe

1791
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
There's no way you did this accidentally

1792
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
Well I mean

1793
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
It's it's

1794
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:37,440
Somewhat similar to Alex's synopsis of Romeo and Juliet in safari

1795
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,024
A bunch of the middle between those two things no it's not

1796
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,632
No no no no no no I didn't be like if you threw a little bit of Hamlet

1797
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,800
Mike Mike

1798
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,640
Gets to being weird some more about the passage about vaccine distribution

1799
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,688
To determine how to best

1800
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,480
Distribute limited doses

1801
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
Of korvax to members

1802
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,552
A priority groups across

1803
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,320
The country

1804
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,368
The US government Resort in New

1805
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,160
Controversial tactics

1806
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Notably heading Healthcare

1807
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
Care providers access

1808
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Patience electronic

1809
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Health records

1810
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,328
To determine the number of individuals

1811
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,120
In high-risk populations

1812
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Receiving care

1813
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Chico area

1814
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,264
This passage really undercuts the argument that this document represents the globalists plan cuz they

1815
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
Didn't do that

1816
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,944
Also while we're on the subject of things that didn't happen in real life that do happen in the scenario we can look at chapter 10

1817
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
The big

1818
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
Giant

1819
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
Gigantic

1820
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,320
I'm going to come up with more words

1821
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,648
What are the big public messaging crises that come up over the course of the ex

1822
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
Gojira merch

1823
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,208
From the ocean

1824
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:46,304
No that's chapter 12

1825
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,424
A huge public backlash because doctors and nurses aren't included in the highest priority group for the disc

1826
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,216
Division of the vaccine

1827
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,496
The huge public

1828
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,800
They even designed to fake tweet

1829
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
But it was straight the outrage

1830
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
Those happening in the medical worker

1831
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
Communities

1832
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,736
There's a strike in Milwaukee among Healthcare Providers when they won't go to work

1833
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
Unless they're made of acxiom priority

1834
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
And none of that happened in life

1835
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:14,208
Yeah I know that's a totally reasonable thing for them to do where that unreasonable thing to occur

1836
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:20,608
Also in the scenario there's a Groundswell of college activism taking place in the social media app that's created

1837
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,400
For this exercise called unequal

1838
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
From the exercise quote

1839
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,824
Another group that was not generally affected by the government's corvax promotion efforts were college students

1840
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
Especially those attending school on the 8th

1841
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Easton West Coast

1842
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:38,784
Public Health officials had no explanation for the lack of vaccine uptake among this population until protest

1843
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,576
Began at several college campuses

1844
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,904
Including uc-berkeley the University of Washington Reed College

1845
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,952
Harvard and the University of Chicago

1846
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,512
The focus of these protests with a lack of access

1847
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Corvax

1848
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:53,888
Particularly for populations in less developed countries like Haiti Guatemala and Cameroon

1849
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,496
The college students involved declared they would not accept corvax until it was made available

1850
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
In terms of both

1851
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
Access an expense

1852
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,080
To everyone in the world who wanted it

1853
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,152
This to did not happen in the real world

1854
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,992
Yeah the reason these events are included in the scenarios the same as anything but doesn't

1855
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:13,600
They presented opportunity for the participants to wrestle with challenges in the field of medical message

1856
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,208
None of it's real but it portrays situations that are close enough to semen real for them

1857
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,024
To be effective and role-playing

1858
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,304
And that's enough for Alex

1859
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,328
To think that it's all

1860
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,352
Secretly real

1861
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
Yeah I mean

1862
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
It seems

1863
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
It seems fun

1864
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,520
Whenever these studies predict event

1865
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,056
That do wind up

1866
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
Occurring

1867
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
Because you're like

1868
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,736
It's really just based on the s*** we've already

1869
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:41,760
Racine

1870
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,576
That's going to almost certainly happen again

1871
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
Because people don't learn lessons

1872
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,952
From things exactly like the thing that were right

1873
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
Leaving now

1874
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
Mike is a weirdo

1875
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
Decided

1876
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,120
Happened he read this passage

1877
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,400
Again

1878
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,424
Like if I

1879
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,960
Normal people would have

1880
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
Checked out already

1881
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
But I'm not normal

1882
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
You still want to hear more

1883
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:10,944
I mean this gets worked out severe side effects including swollen legs severe joint pain and encephalitis

1884
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,736
Potentially resulting in seizures

1885
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
Seizure disorders or death

1886
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,832
Occasionally occur dwarf reward

1887
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,648
From the document

1888
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,184
We're going to handle the beer older that

1889
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,048
Mike is failing to mention here is the passages reading is about the side effects

1890
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,864
So it's pretty corvex human vaccine

1891
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,168
It's on the section about the vaccine for animals

1892
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:38,080
There's a bit of comedy and that he's reading a quote from a fake email that the scenario created in order to depict an exchange

1893
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,128
Give information about an animal vaccine

1894
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,712
And I'd like to dumbasses pretending it's a document talk about human side effects

1895
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Just amazing

1896
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:45,760
That is

1897
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,320
Is real real bummer Town level ship

1898
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,880
She read in contacts

1899
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,160
What the actual thing says

1900
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,256
In 2021 the coronavirus caused an outbreak in region 7

1901
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,048
Parenthetically Southeast Asia

1902
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,352
Population

1903
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,192
Our researchers developed and produced in-house ineffective vaccine against the info

1904
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
His subsequent approval and use

1905
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,288
Successfully end of the outbreak in the region

1906
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,848
Wow largely effective in preventing infection

1907
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,872
Severe side effects

1908
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Including swollen legs

1909
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,456
Severe joint pain and Encephalitis potentially results

1910
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
Begin seizures

1911
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,504
Seizure disorder or dad

1912
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
Occasionally occur

1913
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:24,160
Given the millions of vaccinations required for Regent 7th this resulted in measurable losses in the animal population

1914
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
This is critical to understand

1915
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:31,584
If this document actually said with these Dum Dums or claiming it was they wouldn't resort to tactics like this

1916
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
This is so manipulative

1917
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,144
Yes nonsense

1918
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Insatiable show

1919
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:39,008
If it were truly a Smoking Gun they just be able to read it they wouldn't have to pretend

1920
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,544
That they were reading this

1921
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:45,920
Fake email from us from the document other than the real thing about human sex

1922
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,200
What's the point

1923
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
Having

1924
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
These things

1925
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,040
If you're just going to highlight like

1926
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
One paragraph from

1927
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,928
Every other chapter and then just combined them into a

1928
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
Single

1929
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Double space

1930
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,256
Page

1931
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,024
You know like

1932
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,304
YVR

1933
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
F*** off

1934
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:03,840
Bike

1935
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,936
Mike read the passage about conspiracy theories that go around and Alex

1936
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,496
It's so excited that he has to read it himself

1937
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
I think it's because you like

1938
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,056
I want to maybe use a

1939
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:19,456
Cod of me saying this later like in a John bowne report right to have this weirdo reader

1940
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,992
I wanted to be in my voice

1941
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:26,880
Conspiracy theories also prevalent across social media suggesting the virus have been purposely created

1942
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:31,488
Introducing the population by drug company or that escaped from a government lab

1943
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,792
Secretly testing bio-weapon

1944
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,328
This isn't 2,000

1945
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,168
And 17 right after fauci says

1946
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,728
A virus will be released

1947
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,520
It's going to happen to judge challenge Trump

1948
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,568
It's going to be a surprise operation

1949
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
Thought you didn't say that

1950
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,128
In the speech that he was given

1951
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Then we talked about

1952
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:55,296
Cuz he was talked about every Administration deals with an unforeseen Health crisis conspiracy theory

1953
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:58,112
Sounds that it would escape from a government lab

1954
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Just

1955
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:02,720
Twenty years after Alex started thing that every 4 months

1956
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:10,656
We went to that we listen to that 2003 episode now to think foot-in-mouth came out of Port Townsend

1957
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:17,056
Like yeah of course they would add that scenario is that you do that's one of the things

1958
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,616
Of the world exactly

1959
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
That's not even

1960
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
Like

1961
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,944
It's just mentioned

1962
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
After the

1963
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:28,832
The entire course of the outbreak

1964
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,112
In terms of the document

1965
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,720
Call me when conspiracy theorist in this paper decide to inspire people

1966
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:35,488
Overthrow

1967
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Mike

1968
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,352
I mean look

1969
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Some of this stuff

1970
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,448
I don't know like someone who's

1971
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
Really generous

1972
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,008
Might be able to say he's just

1973
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Sloppy

1974
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:51,360
Intention behind the US

1975
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
I don't believe

1976
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,968
Biak

1977
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,040
Someone incredibly generous neither of which are we

1978
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
No

1979
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
Also

1980
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,600
Pink

1981
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,648
I heard this and I

1982
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,184
I got really worried

1983
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,744
It took me two weeks to read by the way

1984
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,816
The warding a weaves everything together so you're like

1985
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
What is going on I just hope this is an exercise is real

1986
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:19,008
I was just trying to do the best I can to extract everything so if you had 5 minutes you can just understand what's happening

1987
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
Oh my God

1988
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,104
Omigod Superbad

1989
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Oh my God

1990
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,944
God more than 5 minutes

1991
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,224
That's a good thing

1992
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,808
Sure sure I can't imagine taking two weeks

1993
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:36,416
And I'm coming away with that sort of sewn together quotation that misrepresent

1994
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:41,792
I don't understand like being able to look at this and not be able to understand

1995
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
Fairly quickly what it is

1996
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,424
Like I understand if you if you see it out of context completely out of context

1997
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:54,080
It could be confusing for a bit but if you only had 5 minutes to hear about it shirt

1998
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,152
Down and actually read a couple Pages Friday

1999
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
Explain

2000
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,992
The exercise

2001
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,320
I don't know it's 8

2002
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,856
Dear Alex Jones

2003
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
Please

2004
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,720
We're explaining the exercise you've literally can't use this for your proper

2005
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:16,608
I don't I really really don't understand the idea of anyone sitting with this for an hour let alone two weeks

2006
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,912
She's had coming away with any confusion

2007
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,472
About how also there is a disclaimer that Alex

2008
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,240
Shouldn't use this

2009
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,128
This is a hypothetical scenario designed to illustrate the public health risk communication

2010
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Challenges that

2011
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,224
Could potentially emerge during a naturally-occurring infectious disease outbreak

2012
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,088
We're going to the elemental distribution of a novel and or investigational drug vaccines Therapeutics

2013
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,624
Or other Medical countermeasures

2014
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,416
The Infectious pathogen

2015
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,696
No I just didn't Alec

2016
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:46,304
Medical countermeasures characters

2017
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,840
Social media post

2018
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,168
And government agencies responses described herein are entirely

2019
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,216
So there is a disclaimer

2020
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
That does not stop

2021
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Diaz.

2022
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
Doesn't sound like you

2023
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,384
At 10 it's about what they're not

2024
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
Here's Mike

2025
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,504
2 weeks

2026
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,528
Who started

2027
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,552
7/10

2028
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,856
He's going to bring back up

2029
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,880
The power outage

2030
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,720
A week before quarterbacks was released for distribution in the United

2031
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:19,840
The power grid at the Grand Coulee Dam in Eastern Washington State

2032
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,376
Experienced a catastrophic

2033
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
Failure

2034
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,984
Volume vented not destroy any infrastructure or result in any desk

2035
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,520
It did cause widespread

2036
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,312
Power outages in Washington

2037
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,616
Oregon Idaho Montana and British

2038
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
Columbia

2039
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
The power was were

2040
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,968
Restore within a day of the initial outage blackouts continued

2041
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:38,016
Play Muse areas over the next 3 weeks

2042
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,576
And the Resurgence of the band Widespread Panic

2043
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,880
Put that in a vaccine exercise

2044
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,696
Because they're all behind all this

2045
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,232
Things are showing off their people

2046
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Mike seems okay

2047
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:55,424
Confused by why they would include something about a power outage in this document about a medical situation

2048
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,984
But if he'd actually read it he shouldn't be confused

2049
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,800
It'll literally spelled out in the exercise

2050
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,336
This is very

2051
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,664
Clearly to get participants to consider how to be effective in getting message

2052
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,968
Sitting out in a real non-digital world

2053
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
Promise Mario

2054
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
State and local public health officials scrambled

2055
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:17,440
Deliver Flyers printed and copy that local emergency Operation Center is using backup generators

2056
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:20,768
To explain vaccine prioritization and pod information

2057
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584
This extremely time-consuming effort exhaust

2058
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,656
Did the public health Workforce already stretched thin by the epidemic

2059
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,216
Response and several years of budget cuts

2060
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,496
But it was ultimately

2061
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Successful

2062
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,616
Early vaccination rates in Washington Oregon and Idaho were very similar to other states

2063
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,152
And in some cases above a

2064
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,504
In spite of his success the incident underscored the shortcomings

2065
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,088
Associated with relying solely on electronic communication strategy

2066
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,184
That what I just read to you is immediately after the park he was reading

2067
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Yeah it makes it

2068
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,000
Very clear almost impossible to

2069
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,024
To misunderstand

2070
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,864
If there's no way to believe that he took two weeks to read this and couldn't understand what the

2071
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
The point was

2072
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,984
This is either someone who's deeply Disturbed and needs help needs like mental help

2073
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,056
Or he's a willful liar inclined to believe it's

2074
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Yeah

2075
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
I mean

2076
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,664
It is this is not a generous

2077
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,200
Interpretation but

2078
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:15,040
The idea of these people reading a document

2079
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
That tells them what

2080
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,368
It says absolutely does confused

2081
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
Like on a deep level

2082
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,744
Yeah yeah cuz they can't just be like

2083
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,512
Oh

2084
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:29,632
Like that's not a thing they can do they can't read an explanation of what's happening in route

2085
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
Oh well they're being honest

2086
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,496
I understand

2087
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,520
Right

2088
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
If

2089
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
They were

2090
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
Copy and pasting

2091
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:43,456
Various parts of the document and its representation of what it says

2092
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:48,320
If they weren't pretending that side effects in animals where they actually humans

2093
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,392
Because they weren't doing stuff like that then maybe

2094
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:54,720
I would be like oh this is just suspicious Miss run-amok

2095
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,280
Yeah but there is there is work that at

2096
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,840
It's been done in order to misrepresent this document

2097
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Not two weeks worth

2098
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
Spider has been

2099
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Now

2100
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
Jordan

2101
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
RAB do

2102
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
He's about to have his mom

2103
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Mind blown

2104
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,712
This document

2105
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
It's crazy

2106
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,784
Let's go to the next when you look at the

2107
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
Similarity to the name

2108
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,088
Sparse

2109
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
Covid

2110
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,416
And then we have SARS covid 2

2111
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
Okay

2112
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
Same almost same exact name and they wrote this

2113
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,328
Three or four years before the number

2114
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,376
Manamana just

2115
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,680
Rattler.

2116
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,728
It's really crazy

2117
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Where's the

2118
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,104
It's almost like scientists are interested too much

2119
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,408
Indifferent naming conventions when it comes

2120
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,432
Viruses

2121
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,992
And instead it's almost a classification

2122
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,320
It means Saint Paul acute respiratory

2123
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,368
Pretorius Endo syndrome Coronavirus

2124
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,672
Which is similar to SARS covid 2

2125
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
Yeah sure

2126
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:04,352
The reason that this is the city that it popped up

2127
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
I had this whole thing

2128
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,424
About not naming things after

2129
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,776
It's because that whole thing is a World Health Organization

2130
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,616
Convention name something after the city exactly the location where it came up

2131
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,920
And the World Health Organization isn't involved in the sector

2132
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,736
Because that would give a massive

2133
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,784
Incentive for people to be like

2134
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,600
Never f*** with those people ever

2135
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,160
Exactly. This was in 2017 which is

2136
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,232
Is fairly shortly after the World Health Organization changed its best

2137
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
Practice is about that whole thing

2138
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,560
So there may have been some lingering

2139
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
Confusion about naming

2140
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
Convention

2141
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:40,448
I almost guarantee that if the World Health Organization had made this scenario

2142
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:43,776
He probably would have named it conditioned Stars Cove 2

2143
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,616
Hey Rob do would be abhorrent

2144
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,896
He would just s***

2145
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,200
F*** it I might

2146
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,784
It is not weird

2147
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:59,648
Know-it-all know it's it's a convention it's a naming convention it's like a

2148
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,208
You know it's like

2149
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,256
Kingdom phylum is 8 hours

2150
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,304
In terms of like a

2151
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,120
Conspiracy theory this is the one that rises to the level of

2152
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,424
How about that their names

2153
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,240
That's how they named stuff

2154
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,288
There's another connection with the real world though

2155
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:20,384
They want them to name viruses like they do hurricanes like this is

2156
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,968
Virus Maria is that what they would feel better about maybe

2157
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,552
Brings up another thing in this this next clip

2158
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
That's a

2159
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,368
Kind of similar to

2160
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136
Real world

2161
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,464
Then we have the inflated fatality estimates initially

2162
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
They write in the scenario

2163
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,280
CDC fatality rate

2164
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,560
Almost 5%

2165
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
Who fatality rate

2166
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,120
14 and a half percent

2167
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:44,192
And then the fatality rate of over 64 50%

2168
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
This is fair

2169
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,800
The inflated F estimates are in the scenario

2170
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,080
There's a few

2171
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,384
The first is that the scenario supposed to

2172
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,688
Pick reality and the reality of dealing with

2173
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,504
A completely new disease is it sometimes you get some things off

2174
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,576
One of the main reasons is actually spelled out in the doctor

2175
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
If you read it

2176
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,904
Look at the outside of the sparse outbreak

2177
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,720
Physicians understanding of the disease stem primarily from

2178
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:10,048
Extremely severe cases resulting in pneumonia or hypoxia

2179
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,352
They're required hospitalization and extensive Medical

2180
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,168
Mild cases of a disease which produced

2181
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,448
Symptoms including cough

2182
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,984
Fever headaches and delays

2183
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,336
We're often perceived as the flu by people who had them and consequently often went untreated

2184
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,384
An undiagnosed by medical personnel

2185
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,712
As a result early case-fatality estimates were inflated

2186
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,552
Is the real Dynamic play out in the covid-19 outbreak

2187
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,368
But it's been true in other past outbreaks as well

2188
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:40,256
The issue is you can't always assume that it's going to be the case or else you're putting yourself in a position to get blindsided by a

2189
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:43,072
Super deadly condition that you happen to under arrest

2190
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,632
It's far better to be over cautious with

2191
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,168
With new diseases then took

2192
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:51,520
Just let him go and see what happened this is what

2193
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,848
Diseases of killed almost all of us

2194
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,152
Be careful.

2195
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,968
So the other reason that this isn't a document is B

2196
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,248
Because it's made of

2197
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,040
Exercise for medical communicator

2198
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:07,648
And what could be a greater communication challenge than having been wrong initially

2199
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
The study question for the Section 8

2200
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
How can Health Authority's best meet public demands

2201
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
For critical information

2202
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,584
In such as what is the health right

2203
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,120
And what do I know about it

2204
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,192
When the crisis is still unfolding and not all the facts are known

2205
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,824
If you understand this in the context it was written and used all the things that they're trying to create paranoia about

2206
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:26,848
Just sound

2207
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,384
Talking stupid

2208
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,408
That's awesome

2209
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
Yeah he's awesome

2210
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,712
Dude

2211
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,040
Thing that they trying to make a couch like a conspiracy adalah

2212
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,600
Holy Ship you guys are dumb

2213
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,160
Let's go to the antivirals is the next slide

2214
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:43,232
In this scenario they write they have one called

2215
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
Bellossom

2216
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
Alright

2217
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,072
Is it and I are

2218
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:51,168
Side effects nausea headaches vomiting and body aches is actually a viral video

2219
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:57,568
About a boy in this scenario taking the closet here and then immediately projectile vomiting everywhere

2220
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,616
Go back to it

2221
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,432
Then three years later it's Rim desert

2222
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:06,272
And this is not the real name this is the name they gave it later

2223
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,064
It's actually got a different name

2224
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:21,376
Same side effects nausea constipation

2225
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Smoking Gun

2226
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:28,544
If these dudes cared at all they could learn why these drugs have similar names

2227
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,312
Insomuch

2228
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:33,664
Generic name for the drug which is to say they're not brand name right

2229
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,480
The convention for naming generic drugs is to have the suffix

2230
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,272
To the word indicate what the drug is

2231
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,344
Princeton's antiviral drugs generally end in the suffix

2232
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,136
Vir for viral

2233
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,928
This isn't Universal but

2234
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,976
Most of them end up with this this

2235
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
And that's why these two.

2236
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
Sure

2237
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
You know if you can

2238
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,072
Did you go down the list

2239
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,632
And then also like penicillin

2240
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,704
Derived drugs have selling like amoxicillin

2241
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:00,032
Dip powder ovarian

2242
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,872
Done that way on purpose to be simple Soca

2243
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,688
People making the scenario we're striving to fill it with realistic

2244
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,224
Details so they followed except

2245
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,784
The convention for naming the drug they made up in it

2246
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,368
Alton robbed or so stupid and so addicted to think

2247
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,160
Coincidences mean something

2248
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,232
That they take that as a sign that the document is mocking

2249
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
This is

2250
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
Not yeah

2251
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
It's like

2252
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
Just such

2253
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
A

2254
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,632
Just

2255
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:28,192
Don't talk and just scream repeatedly

2256
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:32,288
I refuse to learn anything

2257
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,848
Just now they're both in denial

2258
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:37,152
Read the first

2259
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,176
Page of Google

2260
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
Change the few letters

2261
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
Type

2262
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,832
Any of these questions into Google and the

2263
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,856
First result

2264
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,136
Would tell you what

2265
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:50,208
Yeah it's really easier to understand something

2266
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,024
This clip is just where

2267
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,792
Everything turns

2268
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Aperitif

2269
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:58,144
Rob is in the middle of complaining about like a medical ads and

2270
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
Pressure washer

2271
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,216
Yeah and then you have the native a switch

2272
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,032
Put out by the vaccine company saying the vaccine safe in effect

2273
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,568
And that's all they do

2274
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,360
Vitamin mineral Fusion is a remark

2275
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Google products

2276
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,432
40% off

2277
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
Infowars

2278
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:18,112
It's almost almost like that is a joke

2279
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
Bats

2280
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
That's just too much

2281
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,464
You complaining about like a medical ad

2282
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,256
Too much

2283
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:30,656
These people all they do is put out these ads and say things are safe and effective anyways let's go to come

2284
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,704
Commercial of Alex saying that his stuff is

2285
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,984
Safe and effective

2286
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Oh wow wow

2287
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,080
Ciate Dave Steve gone

2288
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,384
I've got a while now and Alex realizes

2289
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
We did it

2290
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,480
We have not

2291
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Oh no

2292
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Your world

2293
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,296
Humans roll

2294
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
People to care about freedom

2295
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,624
I get upset Rob gets upset

2296
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,440
We spent weeks studying as we finally get on Erin it should

2297
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,024
He's covered 10% of what's in front of us

2298
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,840
Every bit of this is just as insane or insane

2299
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,144
I've even gotten the part where they admit they're doing this

2300
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,936
The kill you and save the Earth

2301
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,728
They admit they're doing this

2302
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,008
Apart is not

2303
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,896
They specifically say they're not doing

2304
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:19,296
Although they introduced a very interesting medical messaging

2305
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:23,904
Okay let's say in this scenario our secret plan that has

2306
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,952
Got Mouse

2307
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:30,560
Oh god of the least reliable and

2308
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Incredible

2309
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,960
Credulous versus now what do we do Let It Go

2310
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:37,984
I guess

2311
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:39,776
Hit the panic button

2312
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,848
So yeah

2313
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,384
This is this is where I

2314
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
Checked out

2315
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,944
That's a good place to check

2316
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,248
Oh okay okay

2317
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,088
That weird Mike

2318
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,392
Was doing that stuff about

2319
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,416
About that

2320
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:02,816
Cut and paste job. I got to get out of here

2321
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,424
And here's where I was like Alex go f*** yourself

2322
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,984
Justin summation

2323
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:13,312
Of the Bombshells have been released here I mean

2324
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,616
Give me the strongest thing is

2325
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,944
The drug names the same before drug even exist

2326
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,248
That's the same before they release it

2327
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
Them running the lab I mean

2328
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,320
This is Smoking Gun

2329
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
1 in

2330
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,136
85 trillion quadrillion

2331
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
Wow

2332
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,184
Saudi

2333
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,720
Things

2334
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Zipfizz

2335
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,328
So convincing for Alex's that there similarities in the name of

2336
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
That far is Cove

2337
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,912
Ansari's Cove 2

2338
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,704
The end to the

2339
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,776
Name of two antiviral drugs and the same suffix

2340
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
Yep

2341
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,616
Pieces

2342
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:53,760
Alex started promoting this on Thursday and this is the best you can do on Sunday or Saturday

2343
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:57,856
Defensive team professionalism blew me away was

2344
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,392
That naming conventions

2345
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Can be used

2346
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,720
In a fictitious scenario also

2347
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:06,048
I never would have imagined that people

2348
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,864
Would have done something so insane

2349
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,656
Nice to stick to

2350
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Basic

2351
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:15,776
Borderline universally standardized

2352
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:20,128
Convention listen to over an hour of this Saturday

2353
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
Alex said that

2354
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,224
And then Rob do brought up also

2355
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,624
They use some of the same hashtags in fake tweets that they have on their the people used in real life

2356
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,208
I got to go help throwing things

2357
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,512
Immediate throwing of things memes

2358
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:39,840
Except

2359
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,400
So anyway I got really excited

2360
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
Because

2361
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,448
You know

2362
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,264
I think after our last present day episode

2363
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,592
I was in the doldrums I felt bad sure

2364
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,896
I did not care for Alex's very weird

2365
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,432
Defensive back gate

2366
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,992
And this was a promise of a primary source

2367
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
We found

2368
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,600
But Jordan I mean like

2369
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,392
We were

2370
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
Talked over the weekend I was telling you like

2371
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,280
I really think that you know I we've got a

2372
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,584
Stay in the present for Sunday I should go

2373
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,120
What is probably going to have some

2374
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,448
Something something

2375
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,008
I thought for sure this Matt gaetz Fenwick

2376
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
Continue as Matt Gates has

2377
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,336
Has had more information

2378
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
Can come out

2379
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:28,224
It looks worse and worse I thought that Alex would either have to double down and triple down

2380
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,016
Or he'd have to cut bait

2381
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,296
I didn't know what he was

2382
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,320
Going to do and

2383
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:35,136
So I was like well I think in the interest of keeping people up

2384
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Up-to-date on the

2385
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,952
That the goings-on of this

2386
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,512
I did get in there

2387
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:44,864
Here we are here we got it we got a new lockstep document

2388
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:51,776
Because you know I think I think sometimes one of the things I enjoy the most about doing this

2389
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,080
The opportunity to understand

2390
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
And something like

2391
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
This document

2392
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,176
That scar causes such fear

2393
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
4 people

2394
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,968
Like to be able to

2395
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,760
To see this

2396
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,576
Freddy Krueger it on paper right

2397
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,392
I understand it for what it is

2398
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,160
Understand

2399
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,720
Like some of the very interesting lesson

2400
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:13,536
That actually could have been learned in nn

2401
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:19,680
You know that the people are doing these these kinds of exercises that probably

2402
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,984
Enough

2403
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:28,640
Of the Lessons Learned on a granular level in terms of some people being able to better

2404
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,176
I deal with the challenges

2405
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,712
The came up over the course of this

2406
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,272
This pandemic right is probably helped a lot

2407
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,040
Right

2408
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Yeah

2409
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,112
I appreciate that I like getting

2410
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
Yeah this is a little bit like if Jamie Lee Curtis was running away from Michael Myers the whole time

2411
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
Time and then at the end it was like

2412
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
Lady I've been

2413
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,888
Trying to deliver you this letter

2414
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:55,264
From 15 years ago

2415
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
This was a complete waste

2416
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
2 time for everyone involved

2417
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,664
Why are we here I honestly enjoy

2418
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,456
Having my time wasted like this

2419
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:07,296
Are boars and I enjoyed

2420
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:13,696
Sounds like you're having fun running away from Michael Myers you know you're not just sitting at your home being like this is always hot.

2421
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:20,352
Calories burning

2422
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,656
That's good stuff so thank you Alex

2423
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,448
I don't look forward to him

2424
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,264
Constantly bringing up this document

2425
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,544
Cuz it's a big old

2426
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,568
0

2427
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,616
But you know Hey whenever these things happen

2428
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:34,688
And it's often good for us to spend time looking at it before 8

2429
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
Gets too out of

2430
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,808
Yeah

2431
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:42,880
Could stand to have Traction in other other communities

2432
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,184
Are conspiracies faces

2433
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
Hopefully Tucker

Covers

2435
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,048
