3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
What up

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Vacation

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064

00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Girlfriend

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
It was weird

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
It was a vacation to luxury

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,072
Comedy on the road

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,400
The drop

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,920
Homo

13
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah I went to the weekend with the delightful nickel out there

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Super fun time

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Cook do you know a lot about

16
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Starting out I'm not sure if there wasn't so great

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
A lot of people

18
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
I want

19
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296

20
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Infowars shirt in the wild

21
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,392
Really

22
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,488
I almost fell out of my

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Oso

24
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Taken aback

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
By this weirdo

26
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,752
That's true

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Walmart

28
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
This person jumping off

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
Journal post doctor Dylan

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
Multiple people with Advanced degrees

33
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
An actual doctor

34
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,824
Medical doctor

35
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,152
I Can Only Imagine

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
Getting the honorific title of

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
Policy walk

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Good little something in the mail I know actually that this one is from

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Episode

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
No it's not.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh no

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
That could be a very dangerous thing

43
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Your friends over ridiculous

44
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
That sounds like what we would do with her without a card yet

45
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Running

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Free copy of the temperature for last night when we were drinking

47
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,928

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Doing something

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Maybe after the show podcast

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Getaround

51
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,264
Yeah and I'll have them people

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
Who cares

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
He'll just convince you that you are recording it's just really have

54
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Like being alone

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
Just like

56
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
You do calling

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
You might end up on our voicemail

58
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Here we go but we got segments B up top

59
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Excited

60
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,079
Hello Dan and Jordan This is Andrew from Redding California

61
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
You may not know

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,247
The 530 represents many cities in reading and stuff

63
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Mexico

64
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
So

65
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
All the way to Chico

66
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Still alive show

67
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951

68
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
And also I just wanted to say

69
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
I love you

70
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Indian canvas

71
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:01,055
Who sings Small Town California

72
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Chico has like a

73
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,879
Population

74
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
Reading has

75
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
140000

76
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
I made that up and I like the idea

77
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
To become

78
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Sort of

79
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
Equinox

80
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
And we appreciate your

81
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383

Exactly

83
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
0 Neon

84
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,327
Yes indeed

85
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
From the 530 zip code you're the only ones whose

86
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Voicemails are going to get played on the show

87
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,639
For now, cuz that b strong

88
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
He's got in front of us is

89
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Current episode

90
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Alright

91
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
12

92
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
No he's still left to his own devices

93
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,615
Haha so where I want you

94
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
2009 episode but something perfectly honest I can progress through those episode

95
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
To them

96
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
So if I were to come with

97
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
With the information that I have from the next

98
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Few days

99
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
In 2009 we have kind of a drive

100
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Episode

101
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
And on top of that I think that right now we're in a situation where I think everybody wants to know what the f*** is going on with him

102
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
I'll tell you what's going on with it

103
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
Not a whole lot

104
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
Who has been kicked off everything

105
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
Yeah now is just spinning wheels

106
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Is weird

107
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Found himself

108
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Pizza

109
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Over and over again

110
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
It's really

111
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
It's probably boring

112
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Is it blaming China

113
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Which was already doing that before

114
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,007
4 years

115
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
So I listened to his phone

116
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,175
More less waiting for

117
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Pretend it's a noble death

118
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Deep deep

119
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
Trouble

120
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:15,615
Event people brought

121
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Is he

122
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
If he doesn't

123
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Say on Twitter

124
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
10 periscope

125
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Internet

126
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Like there are other options

127
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
All those other

128
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Right wing

129
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
Door even just lesser things

130
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Dailymotion

131
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,591
Or something like that but there are those secondary video streaming

132
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
Is Herobrine kicked off Google Play

133
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
No one knows what's going on in Google Plus

134
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,623
He could stream on LinkedIn I don't know

135
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
I never been on a

136
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Me neither

137
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
You should be a little bit more like

138
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
Fired up

139
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
He's not

140
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
I listen to the August 9th episode

141
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
And it was

142
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Incredibly

143
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Like this

144
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Where are the feminists

145
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Arresting him

146
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Find the article

147
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,839
It's an article about how they aren't going to arrest Boris Johnson

148
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Anti-muslim,

149
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
How to get a cheesecake

150
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
She's a slave under Sharia

151
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
So now we can pull that weight

152
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
What did

153
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,727
What he was talking about earlier controversy I didn't know that

154
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Tractor Supply

155
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Muslim women

156
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
That's pathetic

157
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
That's

158
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
You dude

159
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
In his defense I do think a lot of people view the Cheesecake Factory as the last great white bass

160
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
I don't disagree

161
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
I will say that I live in a neighborhood in Chicago that has a diverse population that there are a lot of

162
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
Walk-around

163
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Thought about it

164
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
I walked by

165
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Give the head nods that I give to everybody

166
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
Hi in my social life I can't imagine

167
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
What

168
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Imagine irrational

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Reason to be like

170
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
I'm scared

171
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
In public

172
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,127
Fabric

173
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
Because they

174
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Using more fabric

175
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
The Middle East I got the textile market corner for

176
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
I think started they were just like we expect so much fabric

177
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Excessive amounts of

178
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Fabric

179
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
The issue that it comes down to it actually I saw this awesome article

180
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Unlock

181
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
A little bit of

182
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
WhatsApp

183
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
There's a great response

184
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Boris Johnson

185
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Bruce talking about

186
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Wearing

187
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,759
Covering refuse to take them back

188
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Something to ban burqa

189
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
What have you

190
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Who comic books

191
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,719
I totally agree

192
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
I would go further and say that it's absolutely ridiculous

193
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
The people should choose to go around looking like letterboxd

194
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,727
He also said that if a female student turned up at school or at a university lecturer looking like a bank robber

195
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
He would ask her to remove her face

196
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Covering in order to speak to him

197
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
He added that humans must be able to see each other's faces

198
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
So

199
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Some white people on his side

200
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
This one guy and Mark

201
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Commented

202
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
Vet tech

203
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Just like the Burke up but this

204
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Just like the Burke up at disrespect

205
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Death

206
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
Emerson

207
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
Whoa

208
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Some good responses to the people just

209
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Clowning on him after that on Twitter

210
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
There's one person wrote as a deaf person I kindly asked you not to

211
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
To wear whatever they want

212
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
It's their face and their right to cover it

213
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
It's weird how she ended that way but also I don't

214
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Would you like a weight

215
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
I like where your I don't know which team

216
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:37,151
Josh underscore Salisbury you know who else

217
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
Literally

218
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
I welcome you all to go clean shaven

219
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Respect for the deaf and hard-of-hearing people

220
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Michael unique question about the

221
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
The response was we will find a way to help you communicate

222
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
So

223
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Yeah that's pretty much to believe the general feel of it

224
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
So this is what Boris Johnson isn't getting in trouble for

225
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
I don't want to see any

226
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Cool

227
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
You know

228
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
The thing about

229
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,783
Is that even if you let go of the bigotry

230
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
The ideas

231
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
I think it's ridiculous that people should choose to wear them

232
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Is just a farcical thing to say because

233
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Look at you you're ridiculous

234
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,703
The haircut choice

235
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,543
You choose to continue having that you can get

236
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Close

237
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Terrible

238
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Unflattering

239
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
From a zipline

240
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
What do they mention that picture of him hanging from a zip line look like

241
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Helmet on

242
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
I was hoping they would know,

243
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
You guys make your own decisions about who looks ridiculous

244
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Yeah yeah

245
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Straight up

246
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
That's just straight-up bigotry that's all that is

247
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Where is that

248
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
That that's not fair

249
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
That's stupid

250
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
You're using them as a as a

251
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,383
But on the 9th

252
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
That actually is like

253
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Infowars

254
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,391

255
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,487
Nope what is their response now in the world

256
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,447
Screenshot of of trending

257
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
Go to the app on Apple

258
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
You can't use new one because there aren't new one

259
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:26,111
Extreme at you are number one on trending because of the massive growth that you have

260
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
Number three or number five on the other chart

261
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
And that's still good but if you going

262
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
You go and look at them now zip drops considerably because of those algorithms

263
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
I know this from

264
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Talking to tons of people who do

265
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
If you see a massive spike in growth

266
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
You get bumped up the charts

267
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,199
It must be something that the Gathering

268
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
He's at the exact right time

269
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
To save this sort of

270
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927

That's exactly what any of people

273
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Who were already onboard going to it

274
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
And then you're going to be too menacing returns

Actual people

So they were all people who are like

278
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
They were all people who for

279
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Years were like

280
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
How do I get apps on my rotary phone

281

If you're on board with him that's the sort of thing that's really going to stick in your craw

387
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
If that's the sort of thing that's going to be like

388
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
I better get my guns ready

389
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
I better be ready whenever

390
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Good people

391
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Violence or whatever

392
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,200
They're expecting him to eventually comes

393
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Pencil

394
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
He says we're ramping up for the final Collision

395
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
It's almost impossible not to think that means

396
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
We got to take back the Republic

397
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,976
Like we've been trying to

398
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,792
Make s'mores no good cuz all these Chinese people

399
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
That's what happen

400
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
It's dangerous

401
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Even with

402
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Much less

403
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Penetration

404
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
To the market and stuff like that

405
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
That's what rhetoric

406
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:18,176
All I can say

407
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,528
Music

408
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,880
There's like my Boost

409
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,512
He hates Because by the band

410
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,608
Europe

411
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,960
National sovereignty

412
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
I don't think he's wrong

413
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,384
They have been going after yes 4:30

414
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
Coronavirus actual

415
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
Air France V Orchestra Baobab

416
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
America America Europe

417
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,776
Animes of the Human League

418
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,408
That's Chicago

419
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
Chicago classically globalist band

420
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,856
Do non Global is bad to have that Americano band

421
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Feisty horn work

422
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
25 or 6

423
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:45,728
I heard

424
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
I like that

425
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
Feisty

426
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Looking for a face more like

427
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
The wild

428
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,952
It's just looking for a fight

429
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,048
Different

430
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:15,168
It's a broader

431
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Definition

432
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
I see the horn work

433
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Wrestler

434
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Okay anyway

435
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Look it up

436
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Pull up

437
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Sure

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Let's get this settled once

439
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
These are the only things that I really thought were

440
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Tristan guy listen to on the 9th

441
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
Cover over and over again

442
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm talking about the

443
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,336
The point as much as I could

444
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,688
I'll say that the episode because I was like

445
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
You know if

446
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,624
This is gross or whatever more just like

447
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
I don't have the

448
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
I just listened to H & H

449
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Of other s***

450
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
I don't have the time

451
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,864
With this Alex

452
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
I don't have the time

453
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
And it was just so boring

454
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,240
Couple things that are worth

455
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,568
Mentioning a couple

456
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Fitness

457
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
The. Did I listen

458
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
It just worries me

459
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,576
In much the same way as that final Collision outro from this episode

460
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
I think there's stuff to be worried about

461
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Exploration of August 10th

462
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
2018

463
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
With talking a little bit about David Hogg

464
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,216
What's the weather's more disinfo out there for them

465
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
I noticed that

466
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,816
Delete that stuff

467
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
Super high road delete

468
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
The Super Highway

469
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
Literal

470
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
Salute

471
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:48,768
It sure looks like that but it doesn't matter

472
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
Literally when they hang out with nausea

473
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Comes out with this article about all the times

474
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,664
Breach Outfitters policy

475
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,552
You're all the times he broke his response

476
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Dealing with that

477
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
What do you guys like

478
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
I want stand all this David Hogg stuff I was like

479
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Yeah but they're going to miss

480
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Interpret

481
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Take it.

482
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Super high road about

483
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
Like no you're not you're scared

484
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Your f******

485
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
So scared

486
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,776
They're going to get rid of your Twitter

487
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
He's been

488
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Effectively

489
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Spanish

490
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
If what you say

491
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
Is doing is good

492
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Facebook and Twitter

493
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
You really don't

494
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
Because if you have an audience of

495
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
What he pretends is

496
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,960
No no you have millions

497
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,056
Equality

498
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
People will respond to it

499
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Then you don't

500
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,944
Other than the platform which you're putting it out

501
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Word of mouth will naturally spread it

502
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
If you will be like oh my God this is really awesome and they'll tell their friends about

503
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
Through the natural growth to things that are decent

504
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
You don't necessarily need platform

505
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
What he's doing.

506
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
What he does is the journalistic equivalent of a smash-and-grab robbery

507
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,104
Because yeah by the time the truth is all like so disgusting

508
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
He's already come up with a

509
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
Inflammatory narrative about it

510
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
And that is

511
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,504
Just going to resonate with people

512
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Listen to him

513
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Did the comment

514
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Common sense

515
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
Matter

516
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
He needs the immediacy of

517
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,536
Yeah social networks like Twitter and Facebook

518
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
In order to get people riled up with his immediate narrative

519
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:06,752
And if he doesn't do that then show like a day later and he's already

520
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Beast oil

521
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
Yeah

522
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,456
Amplify

523
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
For Media Matters or

524
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
CNN or somebody to be like

525
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
FIFA generator doesn't have the reach

526
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,304
Because I think that a lot of those places are going to

527
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,144
I don't I'm not sure if they have already

528
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,240
Like we don't care about covering Alex anymore

529
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,080
That Alex is already preemptively creating a narrative about that

530
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Houston

531
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,200
Can me down what they're going to do is start going after Steven Crowder

532
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,552
It was a guy you don't I don't know who he is but

533
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
That's the way of justifying why

534
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
No one cares to talk about him

535
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,536
Is the next

536
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Hit Target

537
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Whatever look man

538
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Well I don't know

539
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,848
I lost my train of thought

540
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,920
Conservative blog and then get our own reaction

541
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,272
That's what we got to do the blaze

542
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Glenn Beck after I pick it

543
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
Reach rapprochement

544
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,928
I'm sick of him not getting address

545
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
He could cry on our show in a sweater is great

546
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
That would be great

547
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Woody wear a tie underneath

548
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
You might work

549
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,920
The Jordan did you know that the Nazis are not the only people

550
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
Football players commonly we're branded armband

551
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
To fill sponsorship deals

552
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
They're not allowed to alter their Jersey

553
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
Nazis

554
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,912
Morning

555
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
Which I think is a very easy leave

556
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Good morning

557
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,784
Further there's a rich history of black armband also being used as a sign of protest

558
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
For example

559
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
On December 6th

560
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
16th May 65

561
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
15 years old Mary Beth handkerchief

562
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
18 years old

563
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
And Christopher Eckhardt

564
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
16 years old

565
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Symbolize their opposition

566
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
The u.s. involvement in the Vietnam War

567
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
They got suspended

568
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Tinker versus

569
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Is Des Moines independent

570
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Free School District

571
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
393

572
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,056
Which resulted in the Supreme Court decided

573
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
School violated

574
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,408
By suspending them for wearing their armbands

575
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,784
You could also make a really strong argument that fellow students wearing armbands

576
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Particularly black armband

577
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Might be harkening back to this sort of History

578
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Student activism

579
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Morning

580
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
All of those things

581
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Come into

582
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
You play all together wear a black armband

583
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Almost the perfect

584
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,448
Right now further expression

585
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Call Black armbands

586
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
Which refers to abusive history that suggest

587
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
Free Multicultural Australian history had been a disgrace

588
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
Largely related to the horrible treatment of minorities

589
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Namely the aborigine

590
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
Parallel

591
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Sure

592
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Did I

593
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,728
They didn't get suspended

594
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,312
The biggest issue I have is all of this

595
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Makes perfect sense

596
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
If you just take a little bit of time to look at

597
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,224
Just take a little time what what is the history of a black armband

598
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
Is it always the

599
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Waffen-ss

600
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
It's always

601
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,440
It's really not there's a lot of

602
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
Black armbands

603
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
And then on top of that

604
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
When the other side is calling people now

605
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
I do agree that sometimes

606
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Little bit too

607
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Capriciously thrown around

608
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
But

609
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
I don't remember who made this argument

610
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Godwin

611
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
If you

612
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
Are hanging out with an ox

613
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,320
You're a Nazi

614
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,672
People in a Nazi is there and they aren't thrown out you are now in a group of Nazi

615
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
If you tolerate

616
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,888
What party

617
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
Totally cool

618
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,264
And elected one of them to the White House

619
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,688
If you are let's say a member of a certain political party

620
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:08,320
And you go to a rally leader of the Free World

621
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Right

622
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Espouses Nazi beliefs

623
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
It's entirely possible

624
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,400
Look around

625
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,472
What other every 8 people

626
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,032
How to make salsa

627
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Please write

628
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
Right

629
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Would you call them

630
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
The right could call them the right

631
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
It's hotter outside

632
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
At least they're not socialist

633
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Amen brother

634
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,904
Alex

635
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
For what he's going to do in order to

636
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,024
To get his version of Rock

637
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,424
I got to love it

638
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
Because he wants something

639
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Call

640
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Yeah.

641
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah we're representantes is it agreed

642
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
Explain

643
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,856
The only thing is going to get out of his problems

644
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
Awesome s*** on

645
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
My statement calling for hearings in Congress

646
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,896
What's really happen

647
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
Birthright

648
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
Is that your Birthright

649
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
This is never going to happen

650
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:59,680
DirecTV for Conservative Republican

651
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
Spiders

652
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
What do we do

653
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
Cuz like their position

654
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
You like

655
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
We got it

656
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
Try and help him

657
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
What that mean

658
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Mr. Jones

659
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:20,416
Could you give at least some differences between you and Nazi propaganda

660
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Fearnow

661
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
Okay well there we go this hearing right everybody everybody can have different

662
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,472
Ever have a beard

663
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
Good point that is a good point

664
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
Necessarily

665
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,904
I'm not sure that I fully articulated what I mean but

666
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
To see if

667
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Alex Jones

668
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Crosses

669
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
That which they will do

670
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
You know like

671
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
Yeah

672
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Republicans in Congress

673
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Total

674
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
And they've just advocated any responsibility

675
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
Doing their job

676
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:14,688
The only reason that we need to control the houses because

677
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,016
The President should be the only one

678
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,392
People like who Alex

679
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Idolizing

680
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,280
And you have people like Matt gaetz who went on Alex's show and then was like

681
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
But Alex is still alive

682
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
For him

683
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
Lakewood they go to bat

684
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Are they

685
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
I want to know that

686
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,224
I do want this to

687
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,600
Every word we're past the Mendoza Line in terms of being a country anymore

688
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
It can only hurt him

689
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,048
I want him to have his Mr Smith Goes to Washington

690
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
That's what I want I want him to

691
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,168
Blame the entire system and say that it's entirely broken

692
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
And really just go for it

693
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,288
Thinking that he will never actually be kicked out

694
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
Will the rules say that I get to talk as long as I want right that's my Birthright

695
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Today

696
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,344
Sovereign

697
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,888
They have advocated the courtroom

698
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Yeah I bet I would bet

699
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Anyting

700
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
That he's opening

701
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Would be

702
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
The speech from that

703
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,128
Like always

704
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Just Glory

705
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
Glory speech enough

706
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
I would love that

707
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
I know that

708
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
Is always like junk isn't more attention

709
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
He deserves much

710
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Tannerite

711
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,024
Control contacts I believe this is the right

712
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,448
You know like they could do the research

713
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Search required in order to

714
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
To get there like

715
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,592
Gotcha question

716
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,296
Alex work

717
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
Noemi

718
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Wait is this

719
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
Treat me with kid gloves

720
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,584
I can't wait for the info

721
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Go down

722
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
But he still hosting the domain for a while

723
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Just has a blank page

724
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,848
Call Larry Nichols on it

725
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,455
Just recently saw Larry Nichols on another website

726
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
I think Alex

727
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
I don't know why

728
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
He's not on his show

729
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,951
I haven't seen him at all another show

730
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Is he okay

731
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
No I don't mean that

732
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,887
But like his rhetoric is very different

733
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
I saw him on another Show when he was

734
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Not nearly the

735
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,567
You clearly doing the character or act

736
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Waze

737
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
2

738
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
B supplica

739
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Supplicate

740
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,759
To Alex's it was interesting to see like propaganda

741
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,063
I only know from Alex's World in another

742
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Nelson show

743
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
Empty holic

744
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
But you know yo

745
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Unity animated

746
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
CNN

747
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
CNN

748
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,871
Broadcast

749
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
Have broadcast from the 6

750
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,759
Might make a diesel

751
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Sandpoint here

752
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Looks like him

753
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
1

754
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,103
They have to pay to be on the airport

755
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,943
Just really funny here Alex earlier in the show talks about how he had to pay

756
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
It's beyond the app

757
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
Alright whatever

758
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,087
Have your app list

759
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Yeah so go f*** off with that logic

760
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
To be on everywhere

761
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Hotel beautiful nice hotel

762
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
2 months ago

763
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:58,847
And there was CNN on on the big television

764
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
I just can't

765
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
Force-fed

766
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Horseback

767
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
You know what's really fun about that there's a look in his face when he brings up the example that he has of being CNN's

768
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,767
It happens to be the Trump Hotel

769
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,887
On the Trump Hotel

770
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,127
You can play whatever the f*** you wants there pretty much

771
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
Powerball news

772
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Better than Fox News

773
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,367
If you want some run-of-the-mill ship that's probably what you're going to choose I don't know if that's

774
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Contract

775
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Do better

776
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
Better that's so bad

777
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
That's shitt broadcast

778
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
Bro

779
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,983
Think just State the gym

780
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,823
Hayward

781
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Local liquor go to a bar

782
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,623
Trump Hotel

783
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
I'm not going to wear your guy

784
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,567
He could even have his old hotel

785
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,407
Hundred percent Noblesville

786
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:42,015
Play theater at a Trump Tower

787
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,367
8 months ago

788
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,207
So after Trump is already saying that they're the enemy

789
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
WhatsApp

790
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Kevin

791
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Outrage

792
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
Okay

793
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
There's

794
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Antifa is out there

795
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,247
They are definitely responsible for the most recent murder

796
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
No

797
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
At protests

798
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
The murders in the violence

799
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
Word

800
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
More from the

801
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,583
But not before that that one guy who just fired a shot

802
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Into

803
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
The Ether

804
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,727
Stucco

805
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
Oh no he wasn't horrible

806
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
Who's only famous because he's stuck stick

807
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,247
Into are protesting hit people with a right that wasn't that wasn't

808
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,671
Ooo-ooo-ooo specifically targeted

809
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Three white supremacist

810
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
To their own devices

811
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,727
Oh no they weren't now they were realized

812
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
They can make

813
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
Look like a people by covering their stuff

814
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,455
Better values that Ava tactics recorder

815
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
You know that's a consideration Foothill

816
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Documents

817
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,471
Corralled

818
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,823
By Soros funding

819
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,967
Should the CIA staged

820
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,343
They just posted that insured me

821
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Portland

822
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
San Francisco Inn in Charlottesville

823
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,887
Maryland the police have stood down we even have the documents in Maryland

824
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,079
Baltimore

825
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,927
Or that was made up of

826
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,743
2015

827
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:43,007
Martial law for Obama 2015

828
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Maryland

829
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,687
Document

830
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,527
You are just reporting all of this

831
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
That entire

832
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,879
Last-minute is all him just rambling

833
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
And expounding

834
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Expanding

835
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
What he's trying to say based on those

836
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
Fake contract that we planned on for about half an hour nonsense idea that anyone would make a ton

837
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,311
Contract for that b*******

838
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,151
So f****** stupid and fake it's absurd

839
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,455
Any right-thinking person that would look

840
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
Unlike baby trying

841
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Figure out where.

842
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
Start

843
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:35,231
Malibu is one of those plastic internet hoaxes

844
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
And Alex

845
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
For a long time

846
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Reporting it is true

847
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
Is reporting it is real that there are

848
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Contract

849
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,031
Soros connected organizations

850
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,311
To create martial law

851
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
It's not real

852
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
It's crazy

853
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
We've already talked

854
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Dissected further but

855
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
It's nice it's

856
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Nice to know this much

857
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Is that the cops

858
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
Worth funneling the white

859
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
Two premises right that's Millie Weaver

860
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
No

861
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
That one side

862
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,663
Is going to murder the other side

863
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,527
So even then

864
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
What he's implying

865
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
Murderers

866
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,231
And they were being pushed typically

867
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
To commit the crime that they wanted to commit in the first place will now Alex would argue that they would not

868
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
Committed those murders

869
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
Or something like that

870
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
To the point of committing a murder

871
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,455
I don't know if it's still okay

872
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,527
Believe the same thing I do

873
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
It works for him

874
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,135
And I watch the videos of Millie Weaver put out and I've seen the

875
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,815
About wasn't there so I don't think that I have the right to make a

876
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
Definitive statement or anything like that

877
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
I know that

878
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
From everything I know about

879
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
These group

880
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
Somebody would have found the other one

881
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
You know whether it's

882
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
Finding the fascist

883
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:36,575
Feminazis or the Nazis bindings them it would have ended up happening at some point

884
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
And if they want a bra

885
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
They're going to brawl

886
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
The other side

887
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,303
What wants to stop people from

888
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,679
What is the murders

889
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
But this is where it gets all twisted

890
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Alex

891
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,079
The label themselves as

892
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Their fashion

893
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
And these people are being

894
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Call

895
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Nazis

896
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,783
Legitimate Nazi groups that are

897
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
Do being labeled

898
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
Anti-fascism

899
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,927
Anti-fascism

900
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,511
But it's so frustrating because that's what he got call the time

901
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,607
Also Unity the other thing that you could

902
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,191
If you were going to say that it's not that the cops were funneling them

903
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Torrid

904
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Cousin

905
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
It's because the cops as we now know are essentially an arm of the so maybe

906
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,223
Maybe they were funneling them towards them so the

907
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,503
Cops didn't have to

908
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:42,367
Murder anybody

909
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
Love murdering people let identity Europa be on the hook for this one

910
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,327
I get no more video of cops

911
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,423
Beating up unarmed black overtime

912
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,007
Looks like that guy with the stupid Shield

913
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
Any wife

914
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,639
Does not understand

915
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
The unfortunate

916
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Sort of

917
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
Complacent other issue

918
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,807
This is this to me is like

919
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
Real strong evidence

920
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
YouTube just a dumb dumb

921
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
This is just very dumb

922
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,999
They propped up failed

923
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
American engine of Lies

924
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
The truth

925
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
Free speech and murdering other people's ideas

926
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:41,247
To form from basic services

927
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,807
But you better be okay

928
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
My electricity

929
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,863
Gracefully combines so many different issues

930
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,423
Like what's going on

931
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
Reason with the cake is

932
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Because it protects

933
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
The classes

934
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Right

935
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:13,247
You are very welcome

936
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,575
If you want

937
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
You are against the Civil Rights Act

938
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Go for it

939
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,743
That libertarian should be but if they want to later

940
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,023
Mi religion

941
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,583
Does not acknowledge that gate

942
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
And as I'm sure you know there's a difference between gay people

943
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
Religion has never

944
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,151
Supported

945
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
Slavery

946
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,111
Matter what your religion

947
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Know about the person

948
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,535
A person whose rights are either being acknowledged or violated

949
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
Electricity

950
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:07,007
No you have some liberals

951
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:12,127
World of Beer

952
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,599
Your electricity will be shut off

953
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
Situation like that and you'll freeze to death

954
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,279
Multiple old women have in the

955
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,167
Hey there is Alex has complained about the past while never wrestling with why is that a problem

956
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Cuz all it is is

957
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Being

958
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
Punished for his behavior in a

959
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
In a media space

960
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,639
Eddie's

961
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Comparing it

962
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
The gay cakes

963
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,455
Situation

964
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Cake wasn't gay

965
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,759
But also

966
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,399
Stand-up chops coming back

967
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,359
Like the Great British Bake Off is that you better make that cake

968
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
But

969
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,367
Conflating with Houston

970
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,439
Situation

971
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
Monopoly

972
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Straight up

973
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,375
Crazy and I know that at the beginning of the show I said that if he gets off Twitter

974
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
In terms of his ability to

975
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
But I don't think that

976
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Because

977
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
He ducked like

978
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
There is a monopoly of the public space

979
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
Booking Twitter

980
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
I don't believe that that

981
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
That's relevant

982
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
Come to the question at all

983
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
He's f*****

984
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
Because

985
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
He needs those

986
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
I need

987
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
He's not entitled to

988
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Because of what

989
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
He does

990
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,775
Weaving how is he able to then say that they should be regulated

991
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:21,663
His entire position is if we talked we talked about that before

992
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,943
Monopoly

993
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
And stuff like that

994
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
Monopoly

995
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Pretty hateful

996
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Sure

997
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,367
But regulation

998
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,511
Whatever she doesn't mind

999
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
To draw but Doug Behrman

1000
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,423
The only reason I bring this up

1001
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
Even that

1002
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Which I agree with you

1003
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Monopolies are terrible

1004
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
I don't think

1005
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
Monopoly

1006
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
We've had this discussion over and over

1007
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
If you do believe that

1008
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
Good for you

1009
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
That's your biz

1010
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,855
That means something about you

1011
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,927
That is not about Twitter or Facebook

1012
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
You don't have either really

1013
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
I have

1014
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,303
Like I'm on Facebook

1015
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
Only for the group

1016
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
That would still exist

1017
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
Repeat whatever

1018
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
But it doesn't help

1019
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,127
I don't post it on Facebook and

1020
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
Maybe a year

1021
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,807
Yeah maybe you're even posted on Facebook haven't looked at anybody else's

1022
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Couple months ago

1023
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Even though

1024
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,335
I'm posted on Twitter in for f****** ever

1025
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,151
We haven't reached anybody with that stuff

1026
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Necessarily

1027
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Like if it works for us it would work for our

1028
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
Lenhart numbers are going

1029
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,487
Very high up we're on equal playing field we have

1030
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
Podcast

1031
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:18,655
We still have YouTube videos

1032
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
They're old but they're up

1033
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,519
It's punching upwards still for us

1034
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
Slowly

1035
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,663
It slowly

1036
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
About regulation inside

1037
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,183
What was the bottom

1038
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
Little confused

1039
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Did Alex Wood before

1040
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,583
Yes yeah

1041
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,703
Enter. Of the show that I think

1042
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Profound

1043
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Dangerous

1044
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
He loves you

1045
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
Not if they're Muslims

1046
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,367
Don't lose the baby with the bathwater as they say

1047
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,719
No it's worse than that

1048
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
Word of the day calendar

1049
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Cogitate

1050
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:36,735
They're going to make their move on the next 3 months this is unprecedented

1051
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,559
Infowars.com

1052
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,887
Alright

1053
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
Buy our products

1054
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,495
MMA won't make their move

1055
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Fun stuff to do

1056
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Discuss

1057
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
But like

1058
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Just like a

1059
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
My response to Alex

1060
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,271
Senpai is like a sleep

1061
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,159
Just kind of like

1062
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
Ridiculous

1063
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,023
Trying to find your way to make people outraged

1064
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
Why UConn

1065
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Might as well

1066
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
Even to a plug-in now

1067
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,943
The add pivots are so much more robust

1068
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Because

1069
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,735
Getting people to

1070
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
Infowars.com

1071
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:47,135
Is so much more important

1072
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,415
The next 3 months

1073
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
That the

1074
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:54,559
Just staying infowars.com

1075
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,519
Go to can you ship

1076
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,567
Absolutely

1077
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
You can do that

1078
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
He just can't have his own

1079
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Stop

1080
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
Hey if you can post

1081
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,735
Their videos on YouTube

1082
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
We could do it

1083
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,599
Stuff you can find it is it is

1084
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
Loft for me

1085
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
Not not

1086
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
So much the Alex

1087
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,767
But that rock

1088
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
I wonder how he's

1089
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
I hope he's okay

1090
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,447
But the reason is because he would put out that without the

1091
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Commercial

1092
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,751
It was so much

1093
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
Commercials for

1094
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,687
Cousin present-day there's no diamond gusset there's no

1095
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
The picture

1096
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Almost

1097
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
I like that

1098
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
All just

1099
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,887
Like little tiny minute-long

1100
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
Clips

1101
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,495
They're coming for Trump fire staff

1102
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
They signed

1103
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
X

1104
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,591
Uses English properly

1105
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
If you if you're that motivated

1106
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
It is what it is but it's

1107
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,671
Special Report

1108
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Really hard to

1109
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,023
Where is OU have a must-win special report

1110
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
Or Alec supposed to money

1111
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Right

1112
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,287
Might but they're all labeled January 1st 97

1113
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,079
So I don't know what the f*** to do with any of that

1114
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,783
How old is he

1115
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,879
What a memo

1116
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
Yeah

1117
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,951
Years ago

1118
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,351
Ask his dad cuz

1119
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
She probably has a

1120
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,423
Trust problem

1121
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,239
You know I think that

1122
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:15,359
I can't imagine even if you're like if you're talenti today Tech

1123
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
Garfield you probably wouldn't

1124
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
Used to work for him

1125
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Even if the salary is okay

1126
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
You probably like

1127
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,599
Yeah I'll go somewhere else I can get a little less working somewhere else and not work

1128
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,439
And you can't lie clean on one of his listeners to be like

1129
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
An intern

1130
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:38,911
Which is why the cast is going to fail

1131
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Believers

1132
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,727
Hoping some of them

1133
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,615
That's bad business

1134
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Joy

1135
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,991
Anyway

1136
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Is on Twitter still

1137
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Reasonable

1138
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Butt out

1139
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
How much was it

1140
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
But this is what he said

1141
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
Infowars is still on Twitter my Facebook

1142
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,167
Play Spotify by Stitcher

1143
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
Name some more spy webcam

1144
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
Description

1145
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:25,503
Call false reports

1146
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,367
This is crazy he doesn't own his own server

1147
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,439
Big

1148
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
Are they

1149
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
That implies

1150
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
Very heavily

1151
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,239
He is vulnerable there yeah

1152
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
If you don't own your own servers Alex

1153
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
You are

1154
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,359
F****** idiot

1155
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,663
I don't know I

1156
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Emails

1157
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
I don't know maybe it is fine GoDaddy

1158
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Who knows that be hilarious

1159
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:10,815
Right now

1160
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
Twitter

1161
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,799
We will look into this discriminatory

1162
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
Even number of stars about

1163
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
What is

1164
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Disappointing if that's the president

1165
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,295
Yeah it was lower on my list my other thoughts

1166
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,831
What that one of them is

1167
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
If it was all these other places Alex's with engaging

1168
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Like Facebook

1169
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
Can you text off that

1170
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,327
There's no car

1171
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,191
No clearly

1172
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,287
Facebook haven't had

1173
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
Putative

1174
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Thing from the president happen

1175
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
We're probably in

1176
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
In the clear

1177
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Then the second

1178
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,735
Biggest

1179
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,039
Is the idea that Alex's pitching

1180
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,855
Did the only reason he's still on Twitter is because

1181
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
The president

1182
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
Of the United States

1183
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,951
Threatens them

1184
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,255
With a conspiracy theory that he believes in

1185
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
Believe that aside for a second

1186
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
What's fascism Jordan

1187
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
I don't know

1188
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:28,383
What is the definition of corporate power

1189
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,687
Covid-19

1190
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,991
Kowtowing to a threat from the president

1191
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
What the f***

1192
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,999
Given some sort of weird threat on the platform

1193
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,535
About this shadowban

1194
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
Conspiracy

1195
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Horseshit

1196
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Finley

1197
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
That is

1198
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
Alex

1199
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,215
The case is cool man

1200
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Business School

1201
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,359
I love the idea of Corporations bending to the will of the executive

1202
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,151
That's not good

1203
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
There's no way there's no way that makes it okay so bad

1204
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,367
If

1205
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,671
It was Craddock

1206
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
It's probably

1207
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:27,007
My theory is that the reason why is because of trump

1208
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,567
Because of

1209
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
4

1210
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,783
Violating their whatever policy of

1211
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,319
Then people can be like

1212
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,855
So you did that

1213
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,183
You know that the president has violated policy

1214
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,999
Many many times and this is what I've been saying

1215
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,887
I support Alex Savon

1216
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,935
Who got kicked off

1217
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,055
What I would advocate for

1218
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,079
I would say it

1219
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,151
Easier to leave him on

1220
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Then it is to

1221
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
To kick him off

1222
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,479
And then have to abide by the

1223
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
Because you're right

1224
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
Welder wire

1225
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,671
Threatening world leaders

1226
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:21,023
Bright places

1227
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
Well maybe not cuz that my forces hadn't actually hit a button

1228
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,959
Position as a social media operation

1229
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,263
Where you do this now you

1230
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Have an expectation

1231
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
That you should live up to

1232
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,895
I think that might be what Jack is doing these terrible

1233
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Is awful

1234
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,711
But I think it might be

1235
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,087
I don't have rules

1236
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:55,327
Really like an advocate

1237
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
They should also

1238
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
Maybe

1239
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
Just

1240
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
You straight up about it

1241
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
Because you are like

1242
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Totally in the race

1243
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,383
We will judge based on who matters

1244
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:13,247
Right they could put that into the okay for them to do that

1245
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,783
They could say hey

1246
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Some people

1247
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,599
They f***** up stuff but

1248
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,879
We can't kick him off

1249
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
That's just part of the rules

1250
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,839
Is a little bit

1251
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:33,983
That is a little bit like my idea for the Constitution

1252
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Robert

1253
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
The same thing

1254
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Toomey's

1255
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
That I think

1256
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,759
I think there's probably more

1257
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
Like

1258
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
Is cowardly.

1259
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Control

1260
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
You know like

1261
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:56,511
You see over and over and over again people who

1262
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
Threatening

1263
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,423
Over and over again

1264
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,007
Who are kick-off Twitter

1265
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,543
Threats against

1266
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,567
Women are taken

1267
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
Seriously

1268
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,151
And women making jokes get them kicked off

1269
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
So right

1270
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
But I would love to talk about more another day

1271
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
Butler

1272
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,183
The real salute

1273
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,999
Straight up about your rules

1274
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,047
This bacon rule is

1275
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
You are making us a lot of money

1276
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,959
We don't care what you say if you were someone who's using this service for free

1277
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
We might have

1278
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Ability

1279
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,591
You know you might be a danger to our profit margin

1280
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
Hey we're going to kick you off

1281
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
Which is of course

1282
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,527
Why they leave Trump in Alex Johnson

1283
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
Every time

1284
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,439
Quote the the president they're always like

1285
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
The president

1286
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,583
And Twitter's like f*** yeah we get another free advertising marketing

1287
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
Every single time the president is tweeting.

1288
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,031
You get rid of a lot of

1289
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Especially

1290
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,591
You diminish

1291
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
The effect

1292
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,383
Twitch Twitter is

1293
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:22,015
Changing the world and the world through the platform

1294
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
Get rid of that

1295
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
I think they

1296
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
Good

1297
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,087
It's dangerous

1298
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Negative

1299
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,647
But it's

1300
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,047
Fruit dessert

1301
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
You come into this weird place where it's like

1302
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,143
If you don't want

1303
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Chill like

1304
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,703
Really just have a

1305
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
But not everything

1306
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Struggle against

1307
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,663
And Alex y struggles in

1308
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
In the position

1309
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
You're stupid

1310
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
He is

1311
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
There's really no other there's no

1312
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,807
About it

1313
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,599
This is dumb

1314
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,927
Pacifica the right way to go about his

1315
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
His situation

1316
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,767
As you were saying

1317
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
If you put together something that

1318
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,607
People want to listen to

1319
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
She's making Bad episode

1320
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,639
Lexi's real bad this is when you got to step up your game

1321
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,223
This is when you got to make your show f****** appointment

1322
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,807
I think a lot of his regulars probably don't want to come on

1323
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
Because he's off all the net

1324
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,183
Bright not nearly as big a platform for them to go on

1325
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,743
That's true

1326
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Jumping ship

1327
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
I don't know

1328
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
I don't know that to be sure

1329
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,119
But I know that he has

1330
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,655
As one of his guests

1331
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,959
Hero of Benghazi

1332
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:54,431
Alright alright alright video of Benghazi

1333
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
But

1334
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
I just think

1335
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
Appointment television

1336
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
With the

1337
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Like what he has it is

1338
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,463
Disposal you got him though

1339
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,303
He's got to remember that made this what it is

1340
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
By being

1341
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,495
Exactly

1342
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
Jonah in the whale moment

1343
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
And he needs to shave that be

1344
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,127
Those are the two things terrible

1345
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,479
I don't know if you ever read this article that there is a

1346
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Back in like

1347
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
Maybe

1348
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
2011

1349
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
I'm around there

1350
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,135
There was a guy who's trying to sell like a tractor

1351
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,791
What happened

1352
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,703
Who is on the tracks to held him down

1353
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
Shaved his beard inmate

1354
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,127
And I wanted you to know that

1355
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,431
You want to make him alright

1356
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,967
Never had thought

1357
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
If it weren't for this tractor do you think bad

1358
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,319
Years ago

1359
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
My beard

1360
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:18,399
Larry I don't wish that on anybody.

1361
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
How many crimes as far as

1362
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
That was pretty hilarious

1363
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,823
And I would do that Alex in the second

1364
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,639
I will make other people eat other people

1365
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
I don't know what I think about that but I do

1366
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
Beyond

1367
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Like

1368
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,599
I don't know how you do it

1369
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,159
I mean where are we August there's no good Halle

1370
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Coming up

1371
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,975
Remember to wait till October

1372
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Easter sale

1373
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Christmas is coming up here be great

1374
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
Because then he could have the ghost of Alex

1375
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,215
Or something like that

1376
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519
No I'm not saying is a bit but like

1377
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,823
G-Code experience

1378
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,359
Terms of something

1379
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
Watches a clip of

1380
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Self

1381
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:05,503
15 years ago or something like that like what

1382
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
To do

1383
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
The bigotry

1384
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Can do it different

1385
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,647
Yeah and you can you cannot be

1386
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Often

1387
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,743
Like stuff

1388
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Is because of

1389
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
Slandering

1390
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,095
Because of the threat

1391
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
That you've introduced

1392
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
The people's lives with your life

1393
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,471
You can you walk that line for Years baby

1394
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,751
You can do it again

1395
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:33,407
Get back to it you're asking for the third acts of of his life in the movie of his

1396
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
If you're either asking

1397
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,735
For the beginning of the third Act

1398
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,527
Where has that moment

1399
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:44,159
Or the beginning of Mighty Ducks where is that the start of this is an Alex Jones

1400
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:48,255
Is the fire in a barrel

1401
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,071
I don't know man I don't know what I meant

1402
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
I'm just

1403
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,519
I don't see

1404
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,311
The future going well

1405
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
Unless it gets rid of the beard

1406
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
Has

1407
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,687
It can't be a crisis of like

1408
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,991
Everyone's trying to kill Trump

1409
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,319
Good

1410
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Where he was

1411
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,815
The yelling isn't

1412
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,887
Even fun anymore

1413
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,655
The fun

1414
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
But he's never do

1415
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
3 minutes of

1416
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Silver Stallion

1417
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,031
In 2018

1418
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,103
It was that is why

1419
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
The show

1420
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,199
Yeah it's because of those things where there's

1421
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,223
There's humanizing

1422
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
Spawn moments

1423
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Is yelling

1424
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
There's lies

1425
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
There's all of that

1426
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Conspiracies

1427
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Everything

1428
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Come together in a bouillabaisse

1429
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
Betty's appealing

1430
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,071
Now he just has rotten

1431
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Food

1432
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,119
It's put into this to

1433
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,399
He's trying to sell it this

1434
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:05,055
It is interesting that when we did our worst

1435
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,383
So waiter isn't even if Waiters

1436
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
Alright

1437
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
In our 2015 investigation

1438
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:19,391
Like the the thing that we continue talking about it

1439
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
Why is he

1440
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Hitching is wag

1441
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,535
Perfectly in the short-term

1442
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
Ended his career

1443
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
Like that's what we

1444
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Positive would happen

1445
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
Lo and behold it came to pass

1446
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
And I think

1447
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,639
We cogitated

1448
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,455
I think as we go further into the

1449
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
The 2000s

1450
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
Which is

1451
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
Agnostic

1452
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,439
I think we're going to

1453
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
Even more

1454
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,351
Where it went wrong wrong

1455
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,167
I don't think I think the Trump is like

1456
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
Laughed

1457
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
Ruin

1458
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,031
Much more before

1459
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Taking into

1460
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,823
Consideration

1461
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
If only because

1462
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,663
We don't know when he starts talking about George Soros

1463
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
That's not to say talking about George Soros

1464
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Is your career

1465
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
It's just that mean some

1466
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,831
Meredith

1467
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:25,183
Secondarily we don't know when that meeting with the Russia

1468
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Was

1469
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
Those two things

1470
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
If we can find those

1471
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
Much more of like

1472
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
This is the

1473
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,423
Definitive Dory

1474
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,215
His career

1475
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,079
Currently he wants to talk more about how

1476
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
Because

1477
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
What he said about parking

1478
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,551
Piece of s*** about what

1479
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,087
And the reason that he's doing this

1480
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
Is because most

1481
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Attack

1482
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
It's off of Twitter

1483
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
Has to do with

1484
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,743
Seaside about David Hogg

1485
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,279
Which

1486
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
Beginning

1487
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
He's going to create some straw man

1488
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,167
And then at the same time

1489
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
He's going to lie

1490
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:21,248
I was at home when the shooting started

1491
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:24,576
And then the shooting was over by then

1492
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,624
Wabasha

1493
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,376
School shooting

1494
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,656
Play those videos

1495
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,368
Are a lot of other people

1496
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
Videos

1497
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
I wasn't it

1498
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
School

1499
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,496
They're talking with that

1500
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
We talked about this already

1501
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,408
Because of edited video clips

1502
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,688
Skip this interview

1503
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,016
In the evening

1504
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
Got his camera and

1505
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
Came back to the school

1506
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
Or whatever

1507
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
Came back

1508
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,928
Obtuse triangle

1509
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
Get some footage

1510
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
That is nothing

1511
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
He was with

1512
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
The shooting happened

1513
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,864
Screw up the timeline

1514
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
This is

1515
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Literally

1516
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,472
Intentionally misrepresenting

1517
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
Because all that

1518
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
If you watched

1519
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,360
Select

1520
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
Taken from

1521
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,944
Came back to the school

1522
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,248
If you watch the rest of it it's very clear

1523
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,808
That either means that Alex has never watched

1524
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,088
The entire clip

1525
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,392
Is only seeing the short versions

1526
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Simplythick

1527
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
School

1528
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,768
He has seen is intentionally lying

1529
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
Either way

1530
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,096
The way he's behaving

1531
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,288
Successfully multiples

1532
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
So

1533
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
David Hawk

1534
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
Well I mean

1535
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,176
I don't

1536
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,992
I don't know what to say it's just

1537
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,064
Yeezys embody and why he's a bad journalist

1538
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Like this

1539
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
This is why

1540
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,416
You need to know

1541
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
A modicum of what you're talkin

1542
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,536
It's bad

1543
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,584
It's a weird place to be

1544
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
Like this show is like

1545
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,984
You don't understand

1546
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Turning this off

1547
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
Because

1548
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,312
Look there's so much just

1549
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
You know

1550
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Yelling about

1551
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
Contrast

1552
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,456
Eli about David Hogg

1553
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,480
All this stuff it's like

1554
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
You're getting defensive is she

1555
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
Is boring

1556
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,088
You're a boring person now

1557
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,624
Your s*** to look at

1558
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
I don't want

1559
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,488
I'll be fine I have a Mastiff

1560
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,472
I'm getting ahead of myself let's play this next week

1561
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,752
About David Hogg

1562
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,896
Running around saying

1563
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:31,456
Twitter

1564
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:37,856
August crisis actor

1565
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:05,248
On some young person

1566
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
What's your definition

1567
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:10,368
World

1568
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,936
With Sandy Hook because I

1569
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:31,360
Because I was looking at all the angles

1570
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:37,760
For that

1571
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:47,744
Repeal the 1st Amendment

1572
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,304
News

1573
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
Cumbersome process

1574
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,728
Will get ahold

1575
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,800
Right we have to go through

1576
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,568
Recorders

1577
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,360
Ratify

1578
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
The Congress has to vote

1579
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
Three quarters

1580
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,512
We did however agree that the First Amendment

1581
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
It won't go away

1582
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,872
Commercials

1583
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,176
Is Star Trek or Star Wars

1584
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,528
Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi

1585
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,856
You strike me down

1586
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,904
Become so much more power

1587
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
And I'm so he gets struck down

1588
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,792
The shot of the the Millennium Falcon

1589
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
That's great

1590
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Stupid

1591
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
It's so stupid

1592
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
The only thing I want to really say about that last

1593
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,968
Equipped

1594
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
Don't really

1595
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
Deal with Alex

1596
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Talk about it

1597
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,624
Yeah and I know everyone wants to talk about him

1598
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,184
If you don't know much about him

1599
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,512
No one died in park

1600
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:29,632
Because he did say that about believable

1601
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
So you might that out

1602
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,936
Or something like that

1603
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,800
There's new wanted to what

1604
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,824
He was lying about

1605
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,640
Have you just come in with that sort of like broad Haymaker

1606
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,920
What you're doing is

1607
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
2

1608
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
Have something fake to

1609
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,784
Respond

1610
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,600
And I've definitely seen that with people who

1611
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
Should know better

1612
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,512
Definitely should know better and getting low

1613
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Sweet action

1614
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,608
Off of

1615
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
But they're real close

1616
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,984
And if they just knew a little better

1617
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
Knew what he actually

1618
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,824
They could do a better job

1619
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,104
But in the meantime

1620
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
You probably stop

1621
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
You can get a lot of points

1622
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
Online I think

1623
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
From

1624
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
Being like

1625
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
Hey Alex Jones

Enjoy it

1629
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
Druthers retweets

1630

Stephanie

1631
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
More engaged

1632
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
All you're doing is

1633
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
People do it for the

1634
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,680
It look for the gram Instagram

1635
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
Got it

1636
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,616
Doesn't matter if you restart a g Moore

1637
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,528
Why are we are not a brand

1638
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
We're bad at Brandon

1639
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
Now we're just like a show

1640
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,208
Back to Alex

1641
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
Really into

1642
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Fear

1643
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
To me it seems like what he really wants

1644
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:04,864
Talk about

1645
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,888
He already said

1646
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,424
Take out Trump in the next

1647
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Three months

1648
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Right

1649
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,008
For the past 15

1650
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
But two years

1651
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
Beyond that

1652
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
He realizes he

1653
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Hey

1654
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,528
And the only thing

1655
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,296
You can't do

1656
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,624
So

1657
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:34,048
Warfare

1658
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:40,448
They're not going to just burn trash cans

1659
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,592
Congressman

1660
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:50,432
Heber City council members

1661
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
Call just

1662
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
And then

1663
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
People that are here

1664
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,656
I mean it's pretty harsh

1665
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,680
That's pretty that's

1666
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,848
The idea that

1667
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
Noah's going to come around

1668
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:25,760
Starting up maybe not doing fires in barrels but they're going to start

1669
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,296
So that's the first piece of

1670
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Now gets worse than this next

1671
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,880
He's going to build this fear up even further

1672
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
Apple stock market

1673
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
Crashes

1674
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:49,824
Stock market crash

Historically

1677
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
October

1678
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,320
October break

1679
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
I just can't believe the globalist you're siding with Tricom dinner and Holly was doing mission that all these crazy people don't want America to come by

1680
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,816
Everybody's globalist

1681
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:17,216
You really should be joining the American president

1682
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,360
They're going to go For Broke

1683
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,688
All sorts of Sleeper Cell

1684
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,880

1685
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,968
Downrightnow

1686
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,016
That's pretty f****** extreme

1687
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:08,416
That's a bit aggressive pretty serious in terms of the I'm trying to scare you

1688
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,768
I'm really trying to scare you

1689
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:21,216
Stand on top of your place and pour chlorine down your chimney is that kind of what he's suggesting that

01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,704
But it didn't have audio

1697
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
The audio

1698
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
I knew what it would be like

1699
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:08,576
Anyway and The Rock never fought that f****** skyscraper

1700
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,112

1703
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
Steven grew his foot

1704
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,144
That's how great the Rock is in movies

1705
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,960
The lost his foot

1706
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:31,360
The end of the movie

1707
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,064
4%

1708
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,368
I got was unvaccinated

1709
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,392
So is there

They're like 50-50 on the on the scale

1711
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,512
What do you think about the figure that Alex is pushing right now

1712
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
How do you feel

1713
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:55,424
General feel like it on top

1714
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,216
You know I hate ice

1715
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,752
Feel like is it

1716
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
For him

1717
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
It's parody

1718
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:07,200
Because no one even his people aren't going to believe that they're going to follow you home

1719
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:11,808
And then put chlorine in your air running on

1720
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
At 8

1721
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,624
Y8

1722
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,416
Do it when everybody's asleep

1723
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
Or do it

1724
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:22,304
During the work day before they get home

1725
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,288
The furnace

1726
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,592
Chimneys

1727
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:42,016
Everybody everybody knows that Iranian sleeper cells operate under Chimney Sweep laws

1728
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,256
Chlorine gas

1729
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
He's trying to tell us something

1730
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,608
Years ago

1731
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,960
So there's a lot of fear going on here it's a lot of bulshit

1732
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:10,688
Everybody better politically

1733
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,136
By the way he does not say

1734
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
You should do 20%

1735
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
You just gets into his negative

1736
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:27,328
So 20% of the time when they start killing political leaders

1737
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,376
Be clear that I'm not like

1738
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
Anyting

1739
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
He never says what

1740
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,544
Please do that 20% of the time it's implied

1741
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
Get a gun

1742
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
And get ready

1743
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,760
They start killing political leaders in Patriots

1744
01:34:55,488 --> 01:35:00,096
This tradition

1745
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:05,728
Ron Paul

1746
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,800
Judge they're going to the Supreme Court

1747
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,688
There is no

1748
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,552
The Cold War was World War

1749
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,272
New Congress is World War 4

1750
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:53,088
Pick your side it's already begun

1751
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
Embarrass

1752
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,280

1757
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,800
You know they're going to kill cops

1758
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,360
Kill cops

1759
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,664
Stock markets going to crash in October

When we do start murdering all of the Patriots

1768
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,704
Are one of our big rules

1769
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728

1784
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,472
The 2009 episode that I were not covering yet

1791
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
He needs

1792
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
Just

1793
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488
Stop

1794
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,280
And let Paul Joseph Watson

1795
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,840
He needs to get away from it

1796
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,680
Let Paul Joseph Watson take over Infowars and let him be the guy

1797
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,472
From behind the scenes

1798
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:50,592
Controlling stuff never going to do it cannot be behind this

1799
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:54,432
Have to have all these I understand

1800
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,248
Living

1801
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
He has

1802
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
That he needs to

1803
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,368
To give it to Paul Joseph Watson

1804
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,208
None of these other dudes can handle that old Charger stuck stay with night boring as hell

1805
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,000
Paul sucks also

1806
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
Much more popular

1807
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,120
If Alex wants to survive

1808
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:16,448
At the end of the day based on what I've seen in the weeks

1809
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,288
He can't do it himself

1810
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
He's too self-involved

1811
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,128
Like all this is so much him

1812
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
It's personal

1813
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Too much

1814
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:31,040
You needs to step away from it and unfortunately that's literally the only thing

1815
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,880
Because

1816
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,904
To be in control of it

1817
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,488
Howie's

1818
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,768

1821
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:56,896
Whatever did everybody

1822
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:03,296

01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,576

That's what it is

1826
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,232
So just f****** go away for a little bit

1827
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,256

Then

1830
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,168
You're going to have a big guy and courageous come back

1831
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,752

01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,720
Mr. Sousa is the number two

1909
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,256
Filmmaker of all time

1910
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,304
I trouble

1911
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,352
So I looked up his filmography

1912
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,424
He's either right behind Allen Smith

1913
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,032
Still in there

1914
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,176
No I'm going to change

1915
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,456
Call it

1916
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
I honestly

1917
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:53,088
Thought when I did my research for this I thought you said he was the number to documentary

1918
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
You said

1919
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,464
Number two of us

1920
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,256
Edna super I understood it to be

1921
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:03,328
Documentary filmmakers

1922
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
Cuz I meant Michael Moore was number one

1923
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,704
Lakers

1924
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,104
So I looked into it and what I found was that the here are the top grossing documentary films of all time

1925
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,920
Made 119 million dollars at the Box

1926
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:23,552
Number to is Alaska part of the wild 100000000 directed

1927
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,368
Number three

1928
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,160
At the box office

1929
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:28,928
Crazy

1930
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:35,328
100 million

1931
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:41,472
Number for PlayStation 3

1932
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,056
93.3 million dollars director

1933
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,920
Dinesh d'souza's filmography

1934
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,456
We got

1935
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,016
2016 Obama's America

1936
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,928
33 million dollars

1937
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:07,328
It was the top grossing documentary

1938
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,608
Fortunate

1939
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,144
Tickled came out that year

1940
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,240
But there's other field in terms of

1941
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
Documentaries

1942
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,312
Am I got the three millions pretty good

1943
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,384
America imagine the world without her

1944
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
14 Milly

1945
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,456
Hillary's America

1946
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
Made

1947
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
13 million

1948
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:31,648
Destination just came out but it's gross about 3.5 million the first few weeks

1949
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:38,048
Which is great for what is obviously a no-budget cost him $100,000

1950
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,912
All four of these add up to

1951
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,680
To about

1952
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,216
7 million dollars

1953
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
Right which combines

1954
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
For his career

1955
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,568
Second behind

1956
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,872
It is so goddamn far from the second

1957
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,688
Even

1958
01:45:55,456 --> 01:46:00,064
In the span of his career as much as March of the Penguins

1959
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:02,624
Or the Justin Bieber concert

1960
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,952
Hartefeld Never Say Never

1961
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:12,864
Now the only person ever to Justin Bieber film great over 10 million dollars more than

1962
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,264
Great and it deserves every penny

1963
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,104
Azz beating Verna hurts

1964
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:29,248
Yeah and Errol Morris Broadband Arrow Morris band

1965
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,784
Didn't have good box office open

1966
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:35,136
Like The Thin Blue Line

1967
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:41,536
No

1968
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:47,936
Cartman crying

1969
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,544
But I don't take those movies also came out at time

1970
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,104
Adjusting for

1971
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
Inflation

1972
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,664
So like Errol Morris is documentaries

1973
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
Is the came out in like midday

1974
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
Herzog

1975
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,832
Around the same time adjusted

1976
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:10,976
But they're pretty well I forgot

1977
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,536
Here's the real comedy of that

1978
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:16,608
I forgot that's Herzog did grizzly

1979
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,680
Let's see what that grows

1980
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,264
I don't like well I'm looking this up

1981
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,824
You go to your phone

1982
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,128
Squirtle

1983
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:34,016
Actually that great

1984
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,320
Hey 3.1 million

1985
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:41,952
MSY

1986
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
Getting 30

1987
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
He's very notice

1988
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,632
Like the fact that he has that in his

1989
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,400
Catalog

1990
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
Snot snot

1991
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,704
To be ignored or

1992
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
Variable

1993
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:59,104
There

1994
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
I don't know

1995
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
Mysterious

1996
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,712
Maybe because

1997
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,016
There's a certain

1998
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,808
Subsection of the population

1999
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,600
Feels underserved

2000
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,672
Conspiracy theories not being

2001
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,280
Aggressively repeat to them by Hollywood

2002
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,864
Artificially inflate the numbers of anybody likes

2003
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,192
What is Kirk Cameron movie Kirk Cameron

2004
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,496
Play make money

2005
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
They don't lose

2006
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,312
Jim Bakker

2007
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,384
A lot of those are like

2008
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,432
You'll have

2009
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,968
Over-inflated gross

2010
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Just because of

2011
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
Church group

2012
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
And we would

2013
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,416
We have buses

2014
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,720
Of churches that coming for movies like

2015
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,488
Carmen

2016
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
Norco

2017
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,024
No

2018
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
Carmen was this old

2019
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,400
Opera

2020
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:56,960
No no no

2021
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:58,240
Christian celebrity

2022
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,776
He would make these look

2023
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,056
Super low budget

2024
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,664
Movies but sometimes they would show up at our

2025
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:07,968
I'm so if we got that they would sell the

2026
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:10,528
Because busloads

2027
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,088
And they would just go see Carman the Champion

2028
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:18,976
I remember my Growing Up When The Passion of the Christ

2029
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,536
Every single f****** Church

2030
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:25,888
My flashlight

2031
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,448
Because of like too many

2032
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,728
People it was because

2033
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,752
It was all

2034
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,032
Groups of two

2035
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,336
Most

2036
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,896
Movie viewing is

2037
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:42,528
Update have bosses

2038
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,064
Sykesville the parking

2039
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,368
I did

2040
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
That's fine

2041
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:47,904
But you guys all want

2042
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,816
I'm Foothill Furious I never got a handjob during

2043
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
Furious

2044
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,424
You have a girlfriend now

2045
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:01,984
Right

2046
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,776
Is it on Netflix

2047
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,360
I don't know I haven't looked

2048
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:14,016
It's too late now it seems almost organic

2049
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,808
Coregasm

2050
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,088
You know what is on it

2051
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
What

2052
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,672
Justin Bieber

2053
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:25,024
Included

2054
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,352
Netflix has two

2055
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,912
Pay some sort of

2056
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:35,008
Every time somebody has generally I think included in the gross

2057
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
Comes down like

2058
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,848
What would be considered in the grossest

2059
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,872
Contract

2060
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
It comes down to

2061
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,736
Like if you were numbers

2062
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,272
That's on Netflix

2063
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
And get rid of

2064
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,088
Right

2065
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:53,184
Netflix just pays whatever is license

2066
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,464
The top

2067
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,256
OverWatch

2068
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,560
And that's why

2069
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Really shity

2070
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,632
50 boxes

2071
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,192
Like everybody special

2072
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,800
What

2073
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
I've watched it like

2074
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,992
Stillgray

2075
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
Anel

2076
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,320
Anal who's done anal

2077
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,088
Fantastic

2078
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:25,184
Perfect that is not a good representative sample of Rory scovel

2079
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,280
You chose

2080
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
Betty White

2081
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,656
If I need to bring

2082
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:42,336
The last time we checked in on modern-day Alex right after the ban

2083
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,896
Kicked off of stuff

2084
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,432
Made my poinsettia

2085
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
He is faded

2086
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,064
Can do whatever he wants

2087
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,368
We'll see what happens

2088
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,672
My point

2089
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,304
It's his own fault

2090
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,096
He could have done much better

2091
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,400
Rambling about the

2092
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,168
The Chinese

2093
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,520
Complain about the Chinese

2094
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,312
If you want to complain

2095
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,080
Hey Nolan

2096
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,384
Cover the Chinese doing stuff

2097
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920

2098
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,992
Stupid there's an article right here from the other day out of the China

2099
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,576
About that

2100
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,624
Demolition after protests

2101
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,696
Weird

2102
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:32,256
Authorities in northern China delay the demolition

2103
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
Saturday

2104
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,864
1000 people demonstrate

2105
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,680
Local residents

2106
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,728
Drive to Titan

2107
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
Restrictions on religious

2108
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,568
Across

2109
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
A Muslim

2110
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,896
It's part of a widespread attempt

2111
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,176
Bring Believers in

2112
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,784
So you want to talk about stuff like this you can't people are

2113
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,832
There are news stories about that

2114
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,368
I've heard plenty of new stories you can

2115
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,136
Confined from

2116
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,672

01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,048
Brutally Tramp

2119

International Trade rules

2120
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,352
Is China

2121
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,400
It's not like

2122
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,216
It's not like no one is saying China's

2123
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
Dick

2124
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,408
Quiet

2125
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:24,480

2126
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
America's Best

2128
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,600
Where to share in the blank

2129
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,696
Much better

2130
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
If you actually

2131
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:37,536
Buddy.

2132
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:41,888
Just

2133
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,680
Diminished

2134
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:44,960
Beer

2135
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,800
If the exact same game we saw him playing

2136
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:49,824
Years and years

2137
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,104
And he's so true

2138
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,640
Like a like

2139
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,432
Pavlovian dog

2140
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,712
But he is just

2141
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,016
Doing the same thing

2142
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,320
It's not going to work

2143
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:11,072
Probably some domestic issues with his wife

2144
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,120
He needs to overcome it

2145
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,936
And then

2146
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,288
Cuz then we might be cooking with Jack

2147
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,080
And then

2148
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,152
Slater Hill

2150
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,464
