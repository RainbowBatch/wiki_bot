Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,360
We are a couple dudes like to sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
We start and stop

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
And sartan

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,016
Time for everyone know who's listening

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
We are encountering an ink

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,624
Credible technical difficulties

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
We're really more.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
You

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
That will resolve things

11
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
We will be good to go

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
Podcast form

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
So alive on the internet

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
You're probably thinking

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,616
Who does

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,176
The amazing thing about the show

17
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
We do give credit where

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Sure is,

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Midsection has a

20
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
Incredible screaming

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
You got to give him credit for that

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
We always we always go to the info Warriors

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
To figure out why we're why we're having

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Absolutely

25
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,376
Yep so anyway let's go

26
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
And racism

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
Indeed

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,080
Going over the episode from

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
September 22nd

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Is Friday

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
We'll be going over there

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
The experience

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
Sing all the wonderment

34
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
And the bizarre nonsensical

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Bulshit

36
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,392
But Alex has a lot of narratives that are stupid

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Did a lot of behaviors that are stupid

38
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
And we will talk about it all but first

39
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Here is

40
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
Out of context

41
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,120
Discussing the NFL protest

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
That are imminent

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
This weekend here on Sunday

44
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Some of them happen

45
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
I already put out a video on

46
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Preemptively

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Making a prediction that might be a little over block

48
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
News

49
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
President-trump

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Field

51
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
This could save the country

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Little bit grandiose perhaps

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Hey I think I think

54
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
I think that the president calling for people who are

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Making peaceful demonstrations

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Be fired from their job

57
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Maybe the other directions

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't see how

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,184
Okay okay North Korea has

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Wonder Man

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Otherwise they're going to Nuke the

62
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
Fire the black people prosport

63
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
That's all they wanted

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Yeah Lottery situation

65
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
Get the situation like finally I can take up that at take out that San Francisco

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,992
Quarterback Kaepernick

67
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Just making that up there's no reason for any of that it's all stupid we live

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,792
On the f****** world

69
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
Is tweeting about a f******

70
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
Football player Rico doesn't exist anymore

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Puerto Rico

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
A guy kneel during the national anthem

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Break

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Great we're great I want to bring up because one of his favorite narratives is a globalist

75
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm trying to like kill the birth rate

76
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
What have you

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
Through I don't know brainwashing and putting

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Give you on psychotropic medication

79
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Like to link here I'm going to go to the research game

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Here is a study that was just recently done about Flint Michigan

81
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,752
And oh my God the fertility rate

82
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Among people

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Since the lead

84
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Situation

85
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
There is a

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Massive

87
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Massive

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Strand from

89
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Right around the time in the 2014

90
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Serious serious drop

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
Look at this graph states that it's utter insanity

92
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
As a point outside

93
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
But make sure that you know that we added another 80 billion

94
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
UA

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Billion dollar man

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
We can't

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
We can't afford to take care of Flint's f****** water but goddamnit we need another

98
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
Dumpling also if you're watching this live I do feel a little bit self-conscious

99
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,063
Because when I flashed that up on the screen the article from the Washington

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
There is an ad

101
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,487
For the Infowars store on there

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
You go to if you ever go to their website it will be on

103
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,471
Every single page you go to for the rest of your f****** life

104
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,079
Globalists trying to kill birth rates

105
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
Hey a little bit of a tent

106
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
The Flint

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
You never talk about it

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Think about

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
As far as

110
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Situation report

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Like

112
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Flint Michigan

113
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
No real water

114
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Yam

115
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
And Puerto Rico

116
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Has now

117
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
6 million people without water

118
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
At all

119
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
So think about how soon we're going to get on top

120
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Probably never

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Probably never f******

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
I just I had that over the weekend which is like

123
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
When

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Puerto Ricans come to the mainland

125
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,759
Idiot GOP people are going to be like these refugees coming in with and it's like no

126
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
They're part of our

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
F****** c***

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Is America

129
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
Dick we are more American than you are

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
Yeah I don't know when we're ever going to get

131
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Addressing

132
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
But I do know that now is the time that we get

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Get to be Friday

134
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
He's in a weird mood on this day

135
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,847
He doesn't reveal that possibly one of his cats died the night before

136
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
He's not these

137
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
You did say after he called shift

138
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
An archetypical c********* threatened

139
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
To beat him up he did say the next days are my dog

140
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,159
Relationship with

141
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
I don't think it justifies some

142
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
The stuff that we're going to be

143
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
He kills an animal ever

144
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,399
Blood sacrifice

145
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
Restart the show off complaining about

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Ends up

147
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Excuse me

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
Paul Joseph Watson

149
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,855
Complains about some

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Nothing else

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Friday

152
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Hard to believe it's already

153
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
22nd day

154
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Of September 2017

155
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,495
Incredibly bizarre world

156
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Agree about this

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
North Korea threat

158
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Cast

159
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Hydrogen bomb Bud ground

160
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
On an unnamed

161
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
Pacific Islands

162
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
Is a real Hallmark World War

163
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
The underlying cause of his people

164
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,055
That's fair

165
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
It's the same thing from China

166
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
The Russia to the United States

167
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
It's the same thing

168
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
Showering

169
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
It's the same thing powering the Vatican

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
Towering much of the CIA

171
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
It is a bunch of weeks come

172
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Play God trying to run our lives

173
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
With relish

174
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
With extreme enjoyment

175
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
Rapture Delight

176
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
All over Europe

177
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
Protestant and Catholic and Orthodox churches

178
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,183
Government

179
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
They take something

180
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
Muslims in them

181
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,775
Islamic Art displays in children

182
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Muslim churches

183
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
How dare they

184
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
That is

185
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
Churches that have been converted

186
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
To Islamic

187
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Did he didn't give any specific

188
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
No specific number

189
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
So

190
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
Magical fever dream of other government

191
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Taking away tax

192
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Exempt status

193
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
From churches by the way that's not in other

194
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
It's no like we have that

195
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
They do not

196
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,687
It's f****** stupid

197
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Real issues with our past

198
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Absolutely

199
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
So they're doing that they're taking away their nonexistent

200
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Tax exempt

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,463
They're getting rid of the Christians inside housing Muslims

202
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Then they're having

203
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Arches

204
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:43,679
That is problem is they're having Arch Arch

205
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
Yeah but also he has kids about Christian stuff

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
And I would argue that's probably most every

207
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Single

208
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
School days

209
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Yeah

210
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
Yeah I would I would I would say

211
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
I don't know I mean

212
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm never running low on my Chris

213
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:07,743
I get I get his argument that it's like well if it's all multiculturalism

214
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,887
And my rebuttal to that which might be overly simplistic is it's because you already have all the rest

215
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
The time is acquainting you

216
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,335
With Christian why isn't there a White History Month

217
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
If it's not you

218
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
Mostly the same argument but also to your question about

219
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
If he ever is going to give spa

220
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Pacific

221
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Tell you to put a pin in that

222
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
Because it is sort of an in

223
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Introduction to a narrative

224
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
He's going to get to

225
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
A little bit down the line

226
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
So we're going to

227
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Hold off on that for a second I get to this next clip

228
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Where Alex Jones

229
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
Admits that he doesn't know what he's about to cover everything is just winging it and the producer

230
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Please prepare everything for him

231
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
As the cruel Prince

232
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
Basically all the front page article of more than

233
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:10,463
Most of those when I come in and some through it I've already looked at it

234
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Piles of it

235
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
So he's saying that the producers just print out articles

236
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
Page

237
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Higher

238
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Staff

239
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Print out headlines and then they're like

240
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Job.

241
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
Sometimes he's found them before

242
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
Which is a cursory reading

243
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
But

244
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
He's saying that that's only some of the time some of the time he doesn't even know anything

245
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
I love the way he puts it to like

246
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Magic

247
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Rob do works in mysterious ways

248
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Satanists

249
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
Absolutely every time he doesn't get it

250
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Absolutely 100% of the work of the devil

251
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Came back much quicker

252
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Then I then we thought here it is

253
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,671
Churches all over Europe

254
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Islamic Center

255
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Government-funded

256
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,911
Tell them it's good

257
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
Just like the police keep last week's the major city in Finland

258
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
Ted going to school

259
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Bangla London

260
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
Refugees that came in the last two years

261
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
So this is

262
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
Finland we talked about that accidentally said it was

263
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Is the sequel to little rascal

264
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
It might as well be at this point we learned a lot

265
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Multiculturalism

266
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,975
Look this is a situation where someone tweeted at a Finnish

267
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Police chief

268
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,327
And daddy said fortunately the adult Isis terrorist put in

269
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
To school with children did not carry out according to

270
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
A tacit School

271
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Someone else

272
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Replied

273
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,591
I am certainly not the only one with something done to that other 20V

274
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Need to get him out of school

275
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
I'm guessing that's another immigrant who's 20 years old

276
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Replied on the contrary people need to be motivated

277
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
To stay in school on the bench

278
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Whenever whether it's a child or adult

279
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
So it's other person response

280
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
I mean what

281
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,047
As a police officer you support terrorists being in our children schools

282
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Voicemail response

283
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Even a terrorist can benefit from good learning

284
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
It might

285
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Tolerance

286
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm a guy respond

287
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
You don't think it'll poses

288
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Security risk to children

289
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Anacapa

290
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Respond our schools are safe

291
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
The guarantees

292
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Professional teacher

293
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
BrandsMart stew

294
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
These aren't terrorists

295
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Until they've committed

296
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Terrorist attack

297
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
That's the underlying thing

298
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
The member of Isis

299
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
It was just it was just a guy

300
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,375
Another person who committed like a knife attack elsewhere was a student at a school

301
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
I didn't know that

302
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
He was a member of Isis or whatever until you know that all came out

303
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Montreal immigrants as if they are Terror

304
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Selfie

305
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Mentality

306
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Also when it's all

307
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
The only place I could even find anyone making a stink about this was infowars.com

308
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
And they had a link

309
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
To a WordPress

310
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,535
Site Daily Independent

311
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,863
Individual operation called the tundra tabloids

312
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
Alright I am going to start reading

313
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,799
Cuz I'm reading over the

314
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
B-side bar

315
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
B i n

316
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Independently-run is best

317
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,527
Reading the sidebar here

318
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
And I can't even flash this up here on screen

319
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
We have this year

320
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
Multiculturalism is a gross failure

321
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
Assimilation we're celebrating the ones own Heritage but as a full member of the dominant

322
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Culture wins

323
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,423
That's a troubling sort of mentality I

324
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,543
Anyways so at least ethos that's that doesn't appeal to me

325
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
White

326
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
You can have your f****** dumb religion right but as long as you know that the are Christian Nation is

327
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Bream to it

328
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
You're cool

329
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Let's or what that that mean

330
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
That's not great

331
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Was there like

332
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Patient zero for this

333
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
B*******

334
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Like

335
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Was it

336
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,887
What does it all mean

337
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
The caves where

338
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
People just walked out in their life

339
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Holyshit

340
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Was that problem

341
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
From the

342
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
You got it was

343
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Okay

344
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Use with the apostrophe s on the

345
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Kickstart is 5% Tuesday

346
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,207
Even in those caveman

347
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Heterogeneous

348
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Population

349
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Living in tribal

350
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
Right and so they already built up cultures within themselves

351
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Before they ever would have

352
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Encountered

353
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
People of different colors and

354
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
So I probably

355
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
Probably would have liked your built-in tribal

356
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
Mentality before you encounter

357
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,575
Yeah but probably some updates back that far

358
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
System of white supremacy

359
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Bonkers to me

360
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Everywhere

361
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Subtle shapes

362
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Conforms to

363
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
It's

364
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
The big problem

365
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Yeah if you were white supremacy

366
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Yeah but

367
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Just go away

368
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,687
Build a spaceship hate everybody

369
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
Just get away from us

370
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
You think the whites

371
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Supremacy is a problem

372
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
I guess you would say that to me as well

373
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
But

374
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
He wants to tell you

375
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Differ

376
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Parties that are all teaming up because of one thing

377
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
They all enjoy

378
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
And they're the real

379
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Cowboy

380
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
To the globalist to the pedophile armies

381
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,079
Because it's right there in the

382
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
It's right there that you can

383
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
But if you're an adult

384
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,719
Love that pedophile

00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Satanist

386

That's all it is

387
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
Nuclear weapons

388
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
North Korea

389
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671

00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Pedophile

Misrepresented

398

Like the

401
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
I'm certain if you go to their website they're not going to

402
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,375
To have like a video of a five-year-old dancing with the headline we want to f*** this girl

403
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
Did you not see Ally McBeal

What's not doing right now

00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,839
Alex has started the show with some pretty responsible talk

411
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
But also this narrative

412
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
About

413
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
People taking over

414
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Churches

415
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
The Muslims taking over

416
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Churches

417
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,031

A serial killer

424
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
Who is still killing

425
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191

00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Amazing

429
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,383
America elected Andrew Jackson

430
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
More or less

431
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503

I don't know

437
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Like even though as you just pointed out those contacts

438
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Philippines

439
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
But

440
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
It seems to me that this what does next clip we're going to play

441
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Kind of what

442
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Actually talking about

443
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,175
And then he's loved in Muslims because he has that video out of Philippine

444
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
Wild wild stuff

445
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,623
Cam

446
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
This is liberal

447
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:29,216
Lab Rats video

448
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,776
He should let in the Muslim merge with it

449
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,360
Rosa people

450
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
The way you dress up for

451
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Eyes Wide Shut

452
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,096
You know what they do Parliament

453
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
Ottawa

454
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
To carry out Satanic rituals

455
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,152
And so now they're altimate fun is to do it charge but now

456
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
But now

457
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Shelf

458
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
Satanism

459
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
The only thing better is to

460
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
To kill a child

461
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
Everything else

462
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Gods

463
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
Temple to bring demons

464
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:39,104
So so there's an Illuminati fashion show that's happening

465
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Church

466
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,272
It's just this thing either give you ever gone to like the vigilant citizen.com

467
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
It's a website

468
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
Horse it's a website where the f*** are you talk

469
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:56,512
There's this whole Trend people believe that the Illuminati is coming out in public now

470
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
Whenever you see stars putting one hand over their eye if a message

471
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Is there a part of the Illuminati

472
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,448
And if you see an eye of Horus anywhere than the Raptors

473
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
The thing is

474
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,800
I think a lot of people in pop culture assertive realized

475
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
They're triggering crazy

476
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
People to write Free Press about them

477
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
I've song Whatever you have stars that are doing me like Illuminati themed music videos

478
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,464
Virus videos at imagery and stuff going to be a flutter with

479
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
This is demonic and that just get

480
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
It's them

481
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,864
Further out into a population they didn't have access to before

482
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Because these are adult weirdos

483
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
They're not necessarily going to be listening to Miley Cyrus

484
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
But now they're going to watch the video

485
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,848
If you even if you're calling for a boycott or something it's basically Free Press

486
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
No publicity is bad for

487
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,784
So how can you be so stupid as to not see through

488
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Alex is b*******

489
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
They're dressing the way they would to go to a safety

490
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Titanic

491
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Just like Eyes Wide Shut

492
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,280
Right so excuse me are you saying that Eyes Wide Shut

493
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
The documentary

494
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Like and does make

495
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
Kubrick Kubrick's daughter

496
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,480
He's like

497
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
He has to go

498
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,512
You think I mean maybe during Buckley's birthday party

Stop they bring

501
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
So

502
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Spell stare

503
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432

577
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,216
They were parody Party trying to just have fun

578
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:30,080
They ended up getting one

579
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
1% of the vote

580
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Cuckoo crazy

581
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,712

7

588
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
The election rules that led to the dispensing of the Rhinoceros

589
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
50 million dollars in comp

590
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Temptation

591
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
As his name was now legally safety

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
The lawsuit was filed under the name state

593
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
Versus Her Majesty the queen

594
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,672
There are heroes still after this world so they're here are some of the campaigns with the rhinoceros party tried to embark

595
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
They tried to repeal

596
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
English and illiteracy is

597
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Canada's three official languages

598
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,216
They're just f****** trolls babe

599
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Tear down the Rocky Mountains to Alberton

Kill people

603
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,224
Estrella Banning lousy Canadian Winters

604
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,856
I don't know dating a free rhinoceros to every aspiring artistic Canada

605
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
That

606
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,208
Is a terrible idea that is the work of seitan

607
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
So I don't know I think we could just ignore the Illuminati fashion show

608
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
Aspect of it I was much more interested in the idea that Canada

609
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Parliament was specifically for Satanic rituals

610
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
I think it's just cuz they have a red carpet

611
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
If you look at the pictures like others read there

612
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Anyway

613
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
Alex Jones gets really salacious

614
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Is really terrible

615
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
Well you're not

616
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,112
At least people believe in Satan

617
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Call Ron

618
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
This coming out the former prime ministers and others

619
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,096
Routine basis that Little Orphan girls brought into their offices

620
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Floor

621
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,960
And I slipped those little girls throat's a little boys bro

622
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
Touch the body they just

623
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,896
Pleasure themselves while the child flops around

624
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Water

625
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Gasping for air

626
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,064
So you just remember that you remember that

627
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Real good

628
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
What you're signing on to ride

629
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
His base that's just using a disgust

630
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
Cigarette oregano

631
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Hey you got to be on my team

632
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
Because the other team is like that

633
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:08,032
I mean it's right in line with his normal behavior quite frankly

634
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
If they get Little Orphan

635
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
Right which they have to

636
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
To be orphans now

637
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Like it used to be

638
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
People would donate them

639
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Another stealing

640
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Brave

641
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
And then they slit their throats

642
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
Don't even touch

643
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
The body which is

644
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
A weird sentence

645
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
Episode make fun of the body's to have that you forgot that

646
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
Turn this one off over the dead body

647
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,544
That's true as you're right it's a neutral Elite

648
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,128
I don't want to really dig too deep into that accept

649
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Point out that this

650
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
Rhetorical style that Alex uses

651
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
In order for you to just be like

652
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
Please ignore how full of s*** I am

653
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Because

654
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
This is the anime

655
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah they split kids

656
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
Throats and jack off to it

657
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,584
I think a lot of the people who believe

658
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Why don't you was right about

659
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
I'll be right about

660
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Far for me

661
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
I mean I don't think it's

662
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
You're right Poppy

663
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
There has to be a bottom to the level of

664
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,992
I think a lot about

665
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,552
The type that are in for a penny in for a pound

666
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
With a lot of this stuff

667
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
So I mean

668
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
I just don't like the idea that this

669
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,952
This is how you demonized

670
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,864
You know it it's the same thing that if we're being totally fair we've got a call out a little bit

671
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
I don't think this is the last

672
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
I think it's just an idiot

673
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
Like Rob Reiner

674
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
And I was at Morgan Freeman video

675
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,664
Morgan Freeman narrates

676
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,016
The video where he explains the flat Amir Putin has attacked us and we're at war with Russia

677
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
And it's a Rob Reiner the organization

678
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Outlook

679
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,160
The reason that I

680
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
Feel like we need to call this out

681
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
While we're calling out Alex Jones for the radicalization

682
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Of his base

683
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Is because

684
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
When we when we talked about this dude is Russian

685
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Concerted campaign

686
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
We don't want this to lead to a war

687
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
We don't we have no interest in that

688
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
A resolution

689
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Of some sort

690
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
A return to

691
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Exist

692
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
Sort of rhetoric that comes out of like Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman

693
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Their organization

694
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
Which is a very weird sort of

695
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
There is a Vite like March to war

696
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Hawkish

697
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
Yeah I know about it it is also radicalizing

698
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
In

699
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
In a certain sense it makes me uncomfortable in the same way

700
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Not the same way but it makes

701
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
The same part of me uncomfortable that Alex Jones

702
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Radicalization

703
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Mission of his followers

704
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,848
Right cuz if you're dumb you might buy into that building

705
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Oh that's not good

706
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,456
He gets people to be dumb on one side

707
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
Some of these other people

708
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
Like Rob Reiner

709
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
If people be dumped on the other side

710
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Interesting

711
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Thought though

712
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
I know I did I don't like

713
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
So is is the

714
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,536
Cyber cyber attacks Russia

715
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Has committed again

716
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
Are they more just an offshoot of the normal

717
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Spying that we

718
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,472
We cybertech

719
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
We spy on them they spy on us

720
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
But that whole thing

721
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Is it just a normal offshoot of

722
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Spycraft

723
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Or

724
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Is it an actual

725
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Warther

726
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Is that really

727
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
It's not something that we

728
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
There's no

729
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Boots on the ground in Russia

730
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
You know like that's not ever going to

731
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Also

732
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
I get we made the classic blunders going into Afghanistan

733
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
But

734
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Nobody's dumb enough to March

735
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Into Russia during

736
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,264
I figured that one out

737
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Yeah

738
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Look

739
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
I don't know what people

740
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,968
Who I don't agree with or really I don't know Rob Reiner

741
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
I don't know those f******

742
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
I don't really

743
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
Fully know what the neocon want

744
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Like I don't know

745
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
Right but I don't know what their endgame is

746
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
So I can't really

747
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Speak to that buddy

748
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
Flights from the rhetoric

749
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
That comes out

750
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Almost

751
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Preemptive justify

752
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
For a possible

753
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
Hot War

754
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
I don't even know how that could play out it right the beatnuts

755
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
But like

756
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
I don't give a s***

757
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
That's not what we're here to talk about that it was just

758
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Something that I need

759
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
Make clear in the state of like

760
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Fairness

761
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
While we're while we're pissing on Alex we got to

762
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
Make sure there is some ideological can

763
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
So why there's that

764
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
If it's so easy

765
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
To get all those journalists in

766
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
Would it be that hard to get him killed

767
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
I think he has a lot of protect

768
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Turn around him

769
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
Yeah but it seems like

770
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
I don't know

771
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
I don't I don't know

772
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
I've no idea

773
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
How hard would it

774
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Take me to get

775
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
I think you probably do you have a Tor Browser

776
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
I don't

777
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,536
Pretty close to the top of difficult Target

778
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,888
Like hard targets way up there to terms of arms

779
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
Security the fact that he has

780
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,472
Decades of experience

781
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
Spy games

782
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
I think he would be almost

783
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
The most difficult person to assassinate

784
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,712
Professionals

785
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Should be going for that one

786
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
Okay

787
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Security

788
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
If you

789
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,624
Kill the hardest man to kill in the world

790
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
It's perfect so far I'm finding this experience very frustrating I don't know what it is but today I'm very

791
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Frustrated

792
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
These

793
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
I think it started when I tried to adjust your camera and you gave me a f****** dirty look

794
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,800
Serious about that right now I've got to be honest

795
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
So much with

796
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,456
F****** with the Kaepernick

797
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
It's not surprised

798
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,440
What's going to happen what's going to happen

799
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,256
Weird are we done

800
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,936
No we had to technical difficulties at our friendship has thankfully it looks like that is all taken care of

801
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
We've got two more clips

802
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
That are reasonably short

803
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,384
When we enter a period of absurd

804
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
One of the clips

805
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Is 4 minutes long

806
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
I am going to fix your goddamn camera and you are not going to give me the dirty look about it

807
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
Or I could kick your ass

808
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
I don't understand

809
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
How to frame and it's bothering me

810
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Alright

811
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,264
Show me the

812
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,824
Let's get back to business cuz again you ever

813
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
A show tonight we got a lot

814
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Short time to get there

815
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,992
Do what they say can't be done

816
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Sing some more

817
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Smokey the Bandit

818
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,392
Alright so this next eclipse

819
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
Is very much islamophobic

820
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
Islamists will be held up on the highest pedestal

821
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
And they are allowed to

822
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
With enjoyment

823
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,576
Ulta

824
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Wonderful

825
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,952
It's 240

826
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Plus million henders alone

827
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Justin India

828
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,960
In 1,000 years

829
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
You died

830
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,832
So fake laugh therapy and right it's really unfortunate

831
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
Especially

832
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
Considering what's going on

833
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
People being forced into exile

834
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
Has a Nobel

835
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
And she is

836
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
If not active

837
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Still at 8

838
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:49,504
Yeah it well it's debatable I think a lot of people are saying it's debatable whether it actually classifies a

839
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Does a genocide

840
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
Whatever it is

841
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
It's his minority Muslim population

842
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Buddhist

843
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Country in Myanmar

844
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,584
They are having their Village

845
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
People are being slaughtered gang-rapes

846
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Killing

847
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Torturing

848
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
Says statistic I saw was 400,000

849
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
I've be enforced

850
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Into Refuge

851
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
CG status

852
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Which isn't going

853
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Because Bangladesh

854
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Is a disaster of a country

855
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,136
And it's not it's not like there's anything we can even do about it

856
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Is the geography

857
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
You can't

858
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
Like a flood

859
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
All the time

860
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,632
Because of the low-lying US that like it's the country in the world has the lowest gross domestic product

861
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Because

862
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
It doesn't there's nothing you could do that makes it stop mineral-rich there's no agricultural potential

863
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Brokedown Palace

864
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Yeah

865
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
100 / 400,000

866
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
Minority Muslim population

867
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Aggressive

868
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Majority

869
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Controls the government

870
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
I mean

871
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
Never talks about that religion

872
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
You can't talk about that It Busta

873
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Does narrative

874
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
I'm going to skip this next clip cuz

875
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
It's nonsense

876
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
It's about how the world was supposed to

877
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Send yesterday

878
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,456
People have mischaracterized

879
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
You thought the world was going to end

880
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
The 23rd

881
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
And reality

882
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Just had guests on that said it

883
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Probably

884
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
You're a smart man

885
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,304
So now we're going to enter the. Of the show

886
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Where

887
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
No

888
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
No

889
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Love you babe

890
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Alright

891
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
No this this is where Alex I think

892
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
I want

893
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
To get into races

894
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Voiceover work

895
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
That's what I think is

896
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Primarily motivating a lot of

897
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
He has some news about Kim Jeong Hoon

898
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
He's not going to do it

899
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,375
This clip is 4 minutes long

900
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,423
And I couldn't cut it anywhere

901
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Because there's nowhere to cut

902
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
I could have got 20 seconds

903
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,639
And you would have gotten the full effect but we have to play it all because

904
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
This is what's on his show

905
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
5

906
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Trump was fired

907
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,839
Organizations in the United States

908
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,887
North Korea

909
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
As they

910
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
Missiles

911
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Japan

912
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
South Korea

913
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
And others and threatened

914
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,199
Donald Trump America

915
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,111
According to our controlled corporate press

916
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
He will face

917
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
Results Beyond

918
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
His expectation

919
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,423
It's from Kim Jong on never saw a buffet

920
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,311
Says notice Batman Alex Jones

921
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
Samurai

922
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
Wow you still going

923
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
Anytime I get to work

924
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,495
Genesis Coupe speaker

925
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
I'm trying to speak Japanese

926
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:52,095
Oh that was still doing

927
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,543
Korean

928
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
Home Depot

929
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,703
Trump

930
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,799
Japanese for you

931
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,359
So this point he's pulled up the Belushi clip

932
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,455
The video is Belushi as the samurai

933
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,063
With the with the voiceover

934
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,623
Let me show you actual footage

935
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
I'm going to go see hun

936
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
Probably

937
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,095
That is pretty funny

938
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,199
Get me a samurai sword now

939
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,087
Do you not know that

940
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
I don't think he knows what Gallows humor

941
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,263
I really don't think he understands that there's a

942
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
In Korea and Japan

943
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,895
I don't think he understands why

944
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
It's

945
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,271
Really disgraceful to do the

946
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
Prison Break

947
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
Right but also like that's

948
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207
Three and a half minutes of him just going on his show

949
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,303
How do you not how much enough

950
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,911
Like Kim Jeong hoon is someone you can really make a meal out of

951
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,471
Like in terms of like oh how so

952
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
Substance of the brainwashing of the population the beatings of people who died

953
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,199
Turn off at his dad's funeral

954
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:53,599
I'll be killing his own brother in an International Airport cuz he wanted to go to Disneyland nobody or something

955
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,743
Whatever just like this surface of it there's so many f****** things you could do point out

956
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,351
About the with nuclear subs

957
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Open to discussion

958
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,447
Then you can have about him instead of 3 minutes

959
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
That's disgraceful

960
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
Is it though well let's play this next week

961
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,991
So it was the end of it

962
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,039
The end of it but I'll let see what happens

963
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:39,423
Jobs at restaurant.com

964
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
Population

965
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,263
So let's take a break really quick they are from this

966
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Go to

967
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
Uncle out of Reuters

968
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
Scared

969
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,735
About how

970
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
Have I talked to their Central Bank

971
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
To the other bag

972
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
China

973
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,463
I told them they will be enforcing

974
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
International

975
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,327
Yep

976
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
Strictly Implement United Nation

977
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
North Korea

978
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
For source

979
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Told Reuters

980
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,543
Has not been tough enough over Pyongyang

981
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Repeated nuclear test

982
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
A couple reasons why because I was just

983
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Is completely lying

984
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:27,295
And saying the China is on the side of North Korea

985
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,159
The second thing is the Trump came out the other day

986
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,255
And said you were destroying entire f****** country

987
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
After that

988
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Whenever you said The Conch

989
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:44,959
The middle

990
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
An executive order that he was going to

991
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,775
Implementing

992
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
Texans on on North Korea

993
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,383
But they were but they were legitimately just

994
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
A mirror of the UNC

995
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
China was responding to

996
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
It's just him trying to

997
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,551
Put his own name on someone else's project

998
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
Which seems like

999
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,463
Alex could be this far off

1000
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
And like just

1001
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
It's interesting

1002
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Is it

1003
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Just Breathe

1004
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
It seems more like

1005
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,679
He's lying about this one

1006
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
No

1007
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,335
No it's because he doesn't read the news

1008
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,687
For he comes exactly know what China has done

1009
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
He doesn't know the reason for it

1010
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
He's just heard

1011
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
And he's like

1012
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
This guy is the best

1013
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
He must be the one who's putting

1014
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
Sanctions on Iraq as opposed to the International Community

1015
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
Which is actually effective

1016
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,607
And maybe going to save us from nuclear war

1017
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
Yeah probably

1018
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,479
Let's get back to the ship and see if we can find any

1019
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,343
Is very racist

1020
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,791
Let's go back to morph Kim Canan

1021
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,343
Wow

1022
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Indian chief

1023
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
So he can talk

1024
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,447
Racism over it

1025
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,823
He's playing with clip

1026
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,127
So he has no idea what he's actually say

1027
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
His audience has no idea what

1028
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
A video of

1029
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Something nobody none of them can under

1030
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,855
Understand

1031
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,767
Yes it's a video of Kim Jeong Hoon not screaming

1032
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,095
That it sounds different to our ears because

1033
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,655
Completely different language

1034
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Yasso

1035
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
It is just like a setting it up on a racism

1036
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
Out of the park

1037
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
And if you are like

1038
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
I can imagine some of his audience

1039
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
This is funny

1040
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Music

1041
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Think it's funny there's nothing

1042
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
People like

1043
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,159
You know I mean it takes all kinds

1044
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
Do we need all kinds

1045
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
I'm guessing

1046
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Fewer kinds

1047
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
Takes a village buddy

1048
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Kim Jong-un

1049
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
Almond chicken Toledo

1050
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
So even with

North Korea these weapons which they didn't

1053
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
Even if that were the case

1054
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,775
Embarrass Trump

1055
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,871
20 years down the line

1056
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
Here's here's what's going to

1057
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,463
Just make sure it up

1058
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
He's just making that up

1059
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,559
I don't like

1060
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
You're not going to like the next 10 minutes

1061
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,751
Knox

00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,223
Gundams HomeGoods near me

1063
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,039

1065

Amistad now

1067
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
Getting serious

1068
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
The real world

1069
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:55,743
Translate.

1070
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:01,887
Beyond

1071
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Expectation

1072
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,471
Kim jong-nam

1073
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
Turn

1074
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
We literally just

1075
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
How is a

1076
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,175
Powerful Jedi

1077
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
Why she is

1078
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,599
Beneath the mask

1079
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
Is the cunning and guile of a master

1080
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,023
On ninja of Untold Steel

1081
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Is Buck

1082
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
Clear a code

1083
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Empire

1084
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,791
Prosperity

1085
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
Little boy

1086
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
I love that

1087
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Deborah

1088
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,311
I love that he's been doing that a lot

1089
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
What's the opposite of triggering to me

1090
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015
You know how like when he's it's almost kind of stupid when he says Hubertus I want to punch a wall but whatever he says

1091
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
It's it's a

1092
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,207
If there was a catchphrase I could get behind

1093
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
Eyebrow

1094
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,839
So he throws out Jedi stuff

1095
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,423
He's like doing more voices

1096
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Just call it

1097
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,543
Let's bring back the rhinoceros Party of Canada

1098
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
Rhinoceros

1099
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,271
You know we can run we won't be Vice

1100
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,063
Both co-president

1101
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
Attitude and everybody's press

1102
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,439
For a day

1103
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
That would be our that would be our big running

1104
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,559
There's like a long time

1105
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
4 years

1106
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
You're looking at what

1107
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
410 2nd

1108
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,751
Every adult in America's president

1109
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:20,127
To get your s*** together now way ahead of time

1110
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,735
Is it going to be a hassle also everyone gets to be a senator

1111
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,783
For 10 seconds

1112
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
Cuz you got to cycle through each shakes

1113
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
States Representative in

1114
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
Probably get like

1115
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
45 seconds

1116
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
But then 10 seconds

1117
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Does president

1118
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,279
10 seconds is

1119
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,983
VyStar

1120
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,055
So do you think Alex Jones is going to do more voice over work

1121
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Oh God I hope

1122
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,943
Well I got bad news

1123
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
Let me speak to a powerful voice

1124
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,415
Mission speech

1125
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:31,551
United Nations this week

1126
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:37,951
No

1127
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,703
Open me expect

1128
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:55,103
Unethical

1129
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,199
If I'm being perfectly honest

1130
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
As the one who can

1131
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,759
Critiques and voiceover work

1132
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
I'm not going to give him a job

1133
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Stay in a voice

1134
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:12,255
Would you sliding all over the place

1135
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,887
Substantive like he's not getting into any real issues

1136
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,983
So there's nothing for me to really poke holes in that we haven't covered already left

1137
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
The Hillary gave him the weapons

1138
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Giant racist

1139
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,359
Will Alex yes

1140
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Because voiceover work

1141
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
It's terrible

1142
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
This is dog

1143
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
Now

1144
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
We were if any CNN

1145
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
Committed to doing

1146
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:49,375
If it was just doing a 11 goes on scene somewhere and it's just like

1147
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
It's time

1148
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
To have this

1149
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Let me be clear the like if it was somebody who is

1150
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
Just putting on a fun voice

1151
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:02,175
I'm all right with that

1152
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
That would not be okay

1153
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Broadcast

1154
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,159
Weather

1155
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,815
Stroke yeah yeah it would be that like old-time

1156
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:25,215
Screaming just come up the test pattern pattern

1157
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,031
Those the 7-second delay though isn't

1158
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,359
Tackle him

1159
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,015
Delay is buffering argument is like

1160
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
Did the PCS

1161
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
You said he has an argument

1162
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
No I mean

1163
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
Technically

1164
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
It's not good

1165
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,583
Google Talks all the time about like censorship in PC stuff at the Cuban doing Bing Bong s*** for like

1166
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
8 minutes

1167
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Hey this is straight

1168
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,703
This is 8 minutes straight it's not like I took

1169
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:03,103
Different parts of the episode and put them back up

1170
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,431
How long is it going to do this

1171
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
I wanted to call in

1172
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Please be like

1173
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,551
How can you

1174
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,087
Anyone is censored you

1175
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
That's on the level of Rudy

1176
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:25,887
Breakfast at Tiffany's verbal

1177
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Chinese face

1178
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
Or whatever

1179
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:33,823
Even though I know we're fine

1180
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Tell you he's

1181
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
You're the one being your f******

1182
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,663
Horrible monsters races

1183
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:45,855
Global Systems with a normal finding

1184
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,487
Discretion and compromise

1185
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:57,631
Kim Shattuck

1186
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:07,615
Continuing

1187
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,175
President

1188
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
State of the Trump's threats against

1189
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,719
Cheerleaders speech

1190
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:28,863
The back gives a shot.

1191
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
I want to

1192
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
This is kind of boring

1193
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,519
Trust me it pays off in the end of it

1194
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
I know I know it

1195
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
While he's reading this dump

1196
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,687
Trump and Kim Jeong Hoon have more in common

1197
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Then they have with

1198
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Any of

1199
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,087
The people living in there like what they say is like

1200
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
Normal people have more in common with a

1201
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,927
Chimpanzee than they do with like a genius

1202
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Yeah like

1203
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
People with

1204
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,815
170 180 IQ board distance

1205
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,607
2 average

1206
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
Intelligent

1207
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,423
People

1208
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
And I would

1209
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
The same plane

1210
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Take intelligence out of it

1211
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,311
The two of them Kim Jeong Hoon

1212
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Alex Jones

1213
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
And Donald Trump

1214
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Seem to have way more in common with each other

1215
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,295
Metaphor

1216
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:27,487
I think either they are getting dangerously close to Alex Jones

1217
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
I just

1218
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,815
They've given themselves over

1219
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
No I think there is

1220
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,447
I think it's mainly more my definition

1221
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,007
Like if you're a psychopath

1222
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Clearly with these

1223
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
They have no

1224
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
Or just out

1225
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
He doesn't have

1226
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
Laugh

1227
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
He doesn't have the ability to

1228
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Feel something

1229
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
So

1230
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
If you

1231
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
He's more of a

1232
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
Whatever that classify

1233
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
Like a human being is somebody

1234
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Care

1235
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,791
The teams I weigh

1236
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Cambria

1237
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
You can do all of these things

1238
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
And it doesn't seem like he has

1239
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
It seems like

1240
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,983
He's a psychopath you're not you're not too far off in your second

1241
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Sam killer

1242
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
That kinda

1243
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,615
I mean

1244
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,687
You might be onto something but let's see if

1245
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
I choose is correct

1246
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,815
That is the one I have to follow the last

1247
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
Kim added

1248
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
Everybody

1249
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,967
Millicent

1250
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
Lumos

1251
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:13,471
For drama what Hollywood to call

1252
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,055
The highest levels of Hardline

1253
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,103
Countermeasures in history

1254
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,655
An idiot

1255
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,871
50 Kim jong-un's in battle axe combat event

1256
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
The president

1257
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
Dothan is worded a calendar

1258
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
Yet another voice

1259
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:40,255
Smelled you when you came in here

1260
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,607
He said

1261
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,055
Is the North Place ourselves or Allies in danger

1262
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
Boy can't read

1263
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
Militarily

1264
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,159
He found a pivot point

1265
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:12,767
And he starts talking about how you got a Newcomb

1266
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
Possibly realize that

1267
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
What Donald Trump

1268
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
Homestead

1269
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,399
Pretty much exactly the same thing

1270
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Kimjongun said

1271
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
Like if you if you

1272
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
Just had those two

1273
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
The speech that he gave

1274
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
The UN

1275
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
Didn't help

1276
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
People

1277
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
Whose is whose

1278
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,623
Would you really be able to tell the

1279
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
Not really at the same time

1280
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:44,255
In wrestling I think it's what's known as cheap

1281
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
Yeah they're both pissing on the idea of each other in order to get their base riled up

1282
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
Side mad at them just because you want to

1283
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031
See the blow-off

1284
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,847
There's no paper view, it's a nuclear war

1285
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
Like it's really dumb

1286
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,919
Speaking of which tonight

1287
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,735
Nuclear war trailer for tonight's

1288
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:11,135
No a No Mercy pay-per-view Braun strowman vs Brock Lesnar

1289
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
I'm out

1290
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,255
Just a couple of horses going up against

1291
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:21,631
Got a frozen pizza and watch two big men beat the s*** out of each other later

1292
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
So anyway

1293
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
Yourbestlife

1294
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:27,263
I want to be all so apologetic

1295
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Because you had to say

1296
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,591
Sit through that 12 minutes of bing bong

1297
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,407
We're in the clear now

1298
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,967
We're past that we're going to move forward

1299
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,271
With a couple of other really stupid narrative

1300
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,135
But this next one is just a little bit of fun I've tweaked about this a lot

1301
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
Lately

1302
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,999
That's why I just need to play it to renault's I'm not making it up

1303
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:54,399
Alex Jones has a new song that's been in the rotation for intro music

1304
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423
You're so happy about

1305
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,823
War on corruption

1306
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Hosting

1307
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
He's not ready to announce you

1308
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,047
Looking forward to that

1309
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,583
So I've got a lot

1310
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,631
To say about that 22nd clip

1311
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,727
The first thing I want to say is Tarzan Boy by baltimora is awesome

1312
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,079
F****** height great song it's also a song that is

1313
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:39,199
Very clearly about being a closeted homosexual and coming out of the closet

1314
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,271
Taurus is night tonight

1315
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,087
Give me the other give me the other world

1316
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
No clue

1317
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,463
The beginning of it is jungle life

1318
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,535
I'm far away from nowhere on my own like Tarzan Boy

1319
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Hide and seek

1320
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
I play along while we're rushing through the forest

1321
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Monkey Business

1322
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,447
On a Sunday afternoon or Sunday afternoon

1323
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,031
Burning bright a fire blows the signal to the

1324
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:10,431
The sky

1325
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:16,319
He's like about being isolated and living on your own like Android men are isolated

1326
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
So then the second verse

1327
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,975
Is jungle life you're far away from nothing it's all right you won't miss home

1328
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:28,351
Take a chance leave everything behind you come and join me won't be sorry it's easy to survive

1329
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,911
Jungle life we're living in the open

1330
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
All alone like Tarzan

1331
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Boy

1332
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,823
We play along while rushing through the forest Monkey Business

1333
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,615
On a Sunday afternoon

1334
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
Oops all night tonight

1335
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,807
Give me the other give me

1336
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,879
It is not it's about it's a fairy story of a real

1337
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
It's very clear what it's about

1338
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Team in the gym

1339
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,559
A hundred percent clear it's about dealing with homicide

1340
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
They're great though

1341
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,775
Pickett's banger

1342
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,615
So the other thing he was talking about is this guy is going to be hosting

1343
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,943
In the fourth hour I was totally just listening to

1344
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,271
I forgot I forgot exactly what he was doing

1345
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
The gentleman who Alex Jones

1346
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,623
Excited as a guy who run

1347
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
A giant radio station in

1348
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,487
Chicago they have a little bit of a special thing

1349
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
I pulled up 50

1350
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
Percent off

1351
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,119
I've pulled up the website of the station

1352
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
He run

1353
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
And it is w

1354
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
Pkgam 1530

1355
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,799
If you go on their website

1356
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,407
You can listen to wckg on a.m. 1530 in the suburbs

1357
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:51,039
102.3 FM in DuPage County or online

1358
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,903
It's not in Chicago

1359
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,671
Chat

1360
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,255
Also I went to there as it loads up

1361
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,303
You can see in this

1362
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
That's how they have

1363
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:06,911
A 4.6 out of 5 Stars only 7 reviews

1364
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,703
Knowledge fight

1365
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:15,103
Way more than that very least we can say that we have more snow base

1366
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,407
I have been wckd

1367
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:21,247
Suburban radio that Alex Jones is on

1368
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
It was

1369
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Reference

1370
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,159
What's EKG

1371
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,207
Ckg great

1372
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,511
Thrill it's not

1373
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Chicago station

1374
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,095
It is a suburb station that is a small Pepsi Points

1375
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:41,727
But I'm making it because in the fourth hour what ends up happening is comes on

1376
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
He's terrible

1377
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
He's not ready for primetime

1378
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,615
Castor a butt

1379
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,687
He-ere is an interview that he pre-recorded

1380
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
With Adam Carolla

1381
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
No

1382
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,575
And then

1383
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
I'm particularly heartbreak

1384
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,695
Sing for me

1385
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:08,095
Hit you where it hurts well but I've been predicting for a long time it's only a matter of time until Adam Carolla shows up on Infowars

1386
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,143
This is technically not that yet

1387
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,983
Because Matt do ba runs a Chicagoland

1388
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,519
Radio station

1389
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,359
And Adam Carolla was in town to do his one-man show

1390
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
On September 23rd

1391
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,759
So it was clearly just promotional the interview is mostly just about like

1392
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Hey what's it like with these Hollywood liberals

1393
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,087
And stuff like that

1394
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Walking heart

1395
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,951
Like I studied Adam Carolla like

1396
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,487
I loved him when I was

1397
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
12

1398
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
13

1399
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:42,911
I grew up with him as like a role model really smart

1400
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
And the ability that you have

1401
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
Metaphors and analogies

1402
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,287
Is unparalleled

1403
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:52,895
Elyson people I listen to Growing Up

1404
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Pretty close to right-wing

1405
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Narrative

1406
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,759
Especially keep going on tour with Dennis

1407
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Prager

1408
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
Talking about how College

1409
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,599
Campuses are too uptight

1410
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
You suck too much

1411
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:10,047
Tea culture

1412
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
Not funny

1413
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,703
It's a bummer

1414
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,751
Then

1415
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,103
I listened to him around 9:11

1416
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:29,759
That was when he was still on the radio station Colombia it was a slow he got kicked off the line got kicked

1417
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
The Columbia Missouri radio station

1418
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
Because of what he said after 9/11

1419
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
He was cheering

1420
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,903
No longer

1421
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,463
Muslims you had a very reasonable response

1422
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,255
Is very correct

1423
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,047
Blow everybody up

1424
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,071
Basically

1425
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
His argument was

1426
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,399
All right we got it

1427
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,423
We're going to have to

1428
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,983
They'll go over there to the Middle East

1429
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,799
You guys blew up our buildings

1430
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
We're just going to let it go

1431
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
Cuz we could come over here and bomb you guys

1432
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,735
You're going to bomb us and everyone's going to forget where things started

1433
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,807
Which I would argue that's not the starting point

1434
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
That is a reasonable response and someone to work this out as opposed to fighting

1435
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
The generation of

1436
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
Radio station

1437
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,287
To be in this world now where I am

1438
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
In 2017

1439
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,871
Obsessed with pointing out

1440
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,407
Catalog

1441
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,687
Alex Jones is

1442
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
Nefarious

1443
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,015
To have it dovetail with

1444
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,087
A hero of my childhood it's just a bummer

1445
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,391
Yeah it sucks particularly bad

1446
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
It's like a super

1447
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
Ended up being

1448
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,511
Or like 20 years from now is Chris gethard is a weirdo

1449
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:49,887
Republican turning real hard right

1450
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
Plumber

1451
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,983
Sacrifices

1452
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
Before they

1453
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,823
I would I would assume

1454
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:06,527
Out-of-touch

1455
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
They start to believe their own bulshit

1456
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,159
Somewhat money money is a real problem

1457
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,487
Like even though back-in-the-day he always

1458
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
Like as a bit

1459
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,399
Barely

1460
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
A million million million

1461
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,263
Everybody

1462
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Baby K we should get

1463
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,223
Is that part of the rhinoceros iguana of America

1464
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,503
Let's call it

1465
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
60000

1466
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,343
Kill and give

1467
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
Puerto Rico

1468
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
Really low bar

1469
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,231
Where the rhinoceros Party of Canada in

1470
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Exactly I

1471
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
So in this next

1472
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,215
Alex Jones gets

1473
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Into a situation

1474
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
What's going on

1475
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
60000

1476
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:09,247
It's already a dump I could have pulled Eddie number out of I have a dream

1477
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
Well I mean I was just thinking like

1478
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
If I got

1479
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,623
A couple raises

1480
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,415
I might get there

1481
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:23,327
But that's not net worth that's clear

1482
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:29,727
But like $60,000 a year as a salary is not unreasonable

1483
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
All the stuff in here

1484
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,359
Not $60

1485
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639
I don't know how you put a price on

1486
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,015
It's about Affairs in London

1487
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
Do with Uber

1488
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,111
Misrepresent

1489
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
Situation

1490
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,735
Muslims

1491
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:35,775
Eyebrows

1492
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,591
Okay that's Sensational and terrible

1493
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,175
The news

1494
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
That Muslims are killing people and selling

1495
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,295
So although I don't think the passes hello

1496
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,111
I'm not sure I don't know all the details to drain the blood

1497
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
I don't think

1498
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,903
Human meat

1499
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,487
I don't think human meat is going to be hello

1500
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
This is not wanted

1501
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,911
$60,000 net worth

1502
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
Okay

1503
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Now that's a new one

1504
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,031
I have not heard

1505
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Look

1506
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
Is a bad

1507
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,711
Very there a predatory thing they are ruining people's lives

1508
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,503
I've seen that there really f****** awesome

1509
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
Did not know that they were raped

1510
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:25,951
Know-it-all so I mean at least he's not on Uber side I kind of have to be like

1511
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,535
And now London won't even let Hoover do stuff and then because

1512
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
There have been incidents

1513
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Uber

1514
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:45,663
Failing to report sexual harassment sexual assault

1515
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:49,247
Problem

1516
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,039
But also

1517
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,831
Well we have a 30-day back

1518
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
I called you there

1519
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
People who are just going

1520
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,255
Ignore stuff they think they can ignore

1521
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,535
And that is endemic

1522
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,095
Uber

1523
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,935
There's no indication that is

1524
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
Things to do with Islam or anything

1525
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:14,080
Like that and the reason and the reason getting kicked out of London is that they

1526
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,920
They're not in compliance with a number of

1527
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,480
Then have to do with the same conversation

1528
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:25,600
So we've had over here would like Medallion taxi companies being pissed off at like

1529
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Completely

1530
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
Screwing over the business

1531
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Some s*** like that

1532
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,952
They have Lac

1533
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,000
Background checks for their drivers

1534
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,560
Aldi's there's a ton of Regulation

1535
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
The play into it not just

1536
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,912
The sexual assault stop even though that he's a pizza

1537
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,216
They're not Muslims rape wagon

1538
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,288
Absolutely

1539
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
Evil people and they're real interested in shortcut

1540
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,408
Is that how you make a profit even though they're not

1541
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,480
Yeah yeah somehow they're still losing all of them

1542
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,040
I think it's probably due to lawsuits

1543
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
Set alarm

1544
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
But also the

1545
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
Meat thing

1546
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
Really

1547
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
Like

1548
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
Insane

1549
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,584
They keep bubbling

1550
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
To it's like

1551
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
I don't know it look

1552
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,960
When your title is weird to say

1553
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
These are insane

1554
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
And have it mean something

1555
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
But they're insane

1556
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,592
Paranoid fan

1557
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,176
Warwick if you are laying in bed and it's in the dark

1558
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,992
You wake up at like 3 in the morning and you hear a sound

1559
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
Think someone's in your house

1560
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,160
But no but they're okay take that out of it

1561
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Paranoid

1562
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,584
Right now

1563
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
Eat me in Salmiya tomarken

1564
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:46,240
No no that's where it becomes

1565
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
Unreason

1566
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
Unreasonable

1567
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,336
I did some looking into like in

1568
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
People selling human

1569
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,456
Could not find any connection with his

1570
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Delicious

1571
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,808
No but there is there was there was

1572
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,600
People got busted in Nigeria

1573
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,880
Cuz they were selling

1574
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:07,744
You and me there was I believe who went on it

1575
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
TV show

1576
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,816
Where he went around and he hung out with cannibals

1577
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:17,728
I'm pretty sure you tell me that

1578
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:23,360
I'm pretty sure I don't want to say I don't want to

1579
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:28,992
I don't want a hundred percent but I call that being a new story

1580
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Little boy

1581
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,808
You got to eat brains

1582
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,368
I remember there being a big toe

1583
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:38,464
Kerfuffle about a TV show about heretic

1584
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
Stuff like that

1585
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,536
Cannibal

1586
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
And as I recall he ended up

1587
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
For part of the TV show

1588
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
But I didn't

1589
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
Cuz I don't care

1590
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,240
Probably conflicted

1591
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,568
I would hope

1592
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Crazy

1593
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,664
So I'm at home all of a sudden

1594
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,992
I'm going to skip this next play Love

1595
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
He wakes up in

1596
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
In the middle of night

1597
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
The burger just

1598
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
Nom nom nom nom nom nom

1599
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
To skip this next

1600
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
Text clip

1601
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Because it's just

1602
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,584
Complaints about Jimmy Kimmel

1603
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,192
It's just nonsense

1604
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Close to the

1605
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Senator cats

1606
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,944
Made him a promise

1607
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,968
That he wouldn't

1608
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
New version of

1609
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
The bill

1610
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
That wouldn't

1611
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Take care of

1612
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
And so clearly

1613
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,880
He kept that promise

1614
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
That's not even what this is about

1615
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
What's it about

1616
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:48,352
It's about like Hollywood Elite

1617
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,888
Alex's project

1618
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
So let's just go ahead and play

1619
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,520
You thought it was going to be about the health-care stocks

1620
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,920
Yeah Kimmel

1621
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
And you know you're a joke

1622
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,208
And you know it's embarrassing

1623
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
Watch your show in like you

1624
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,168
We threatened to kill me

1625
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,776
Campbell threatened to kill

1626
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,664
The very things that happened

1627
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,224
Did you probably know about

1628
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
Cuz you're just a message board

1629
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Wiethop teleprompter

1630
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:45,184
Police officer he never ends up saying what he's talkin

1631
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,024
I have no idea what happens the day after

1632
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,096
I don't know what that means but the way it is

1633
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,376
Creepy as f***

1634
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Yeah

1635
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,472
I guess maybe I'm going to guess Alex got like a threat

1636
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
Oh yeah maybe

1637
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,080
That's what I

1638
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,152
The Secret Service came to eStudio entirely possible

1639
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:10,784
Reprising their roles from December 21st 2012

1640
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
To another

1641
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
Look

1642
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
Now

1643
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,304
I'm not going to say one way or the other whether or not

1644
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
Teleprompters are

1645
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
Good or bad

1646
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
But Jimmy Kimmel has never spent four minutes going

1647
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,264
That's true so maybe that's

1648
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
At the time that's true that was a possible job

1649
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,320
Foreshadowing

1650
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,368
Be further apart right now

1651
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
But still friends

1652
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Weird

1653
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,304
Establishment

1654
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,864
Here's your money and now you're somebody

1655
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
Your somebody

1656
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,264
While you run your mouth

1657
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,568
Everybody's ass

1658
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,360
I don't like you

1659
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,432
That sounds like you Alex

1660
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,480
Scared

1661
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,296
Hollywood trash

1662
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,344
Know that you've got

1663
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
The wreath of failure

1664
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
Wrapped around your neck

1665
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,792
Hoard

1666
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,888
Sold out

1667
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,960
What are you talkin about

1668
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:38,336
Himself word-for-word you keep saying you're going to beat people up

1669
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,896
But that's the thing that Alex has to

1670
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,528
No I think he has to know that Isaac

1671
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,320
Everything he does is a noble for

1672
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,136
I think he thinks that selling all these products

1673
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Shamelessly

1674
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,976
Is a noble Pursuit he's not a hore

1675
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:59,328
Twins s*** right here we're talking about

1676
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,120
Do this but I've labeled this clip

1677
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
Projective

1678
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:14,688
2 minutes left of that clip let's fucken cut it

1679
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:21,088
We we hit the Salient Point yourself

1680
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,136
Experience ehasz and

1681
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,568
15 years ago

1682
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,248
Top notch

1683
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:54,112
Pismo's

1684
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,696
I think he might be trying to pin the death of knock on Muslims

1685
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:04,096
Strike that I could use them as the scapegoat for his murder of his own dog

1686
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,400
Also like he's not kidding

1687
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
He's lying

1688
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:11,008
That didn't happen at 100% didn't happen

1689
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,056
Also I don't like that

1690
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,360
Casitas for the Muslim at the beginning

1691
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,384
He's very

1692
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,712
Right on par with

1693
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
The amount

1694
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,344
Somebody walked up to me

1695
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
NSAID

1696
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
A very

1697
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,904
Convenient thing

1698
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,744
Mermaid stories are matchup with my narrative

1699
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,144
Crazy you know what he's like a bad, who hasn't started work

1700
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,960
Into so someone else

1701
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,008
I hate that s*** somebody came up to me after

1702
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,032
Do the show

1703
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:50,432
Conveniently every stand-up comic wins every conversation has Alex

1704
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
Very see-through if you ever performed in your life

1705
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
Alex Jones admits

1706
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
But he's islamophobic

1707
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
Vacations over

1708
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,512
Was there ever an investigation

1709
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:08,352
But in this clip

1710
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,144
Admits it but also is

1711
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,424
Arguing that it's right

1712
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
Cuz I had a buddy

1713
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:37,024
High School.

1714
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,912
In the springtime

1715
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,760
You made your case

1716
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,320
I would not be necessarily afraid

1717
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,880
I wouldn't drop my kid off of I don't have any kids

1718
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,440
But I wouldn't drop my kid off at a park alone

1719
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
Ever

1720
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,864
You need to have supervision of your f*************** Alex

1721
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,216
Would you drop your kid off at a forest where there's a bunch of Muslims

1722
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:22,592
Wait are you saying you've dropped your kid over the 4th I mean why there weren't

1723
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,896
I don't know cuz I don't have kids and

1724
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,432
Probably never will I don't

1725
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,968
Know what the age is

1726
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,248
Where is appropriate to

1727
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,064
Just leave your kid alone but I know it's not about

1728
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,856
For and if they make it back home you can

1729
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,904
Continue to raise them and if they don't they

1730
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:41,792
They have completed the right exactly the right of passage

1731
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,376
You know how high school they do orienteering

1732
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,704
You know like when you take compass

1733
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
You got to find your way out

1734
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:54,592
No in cuz I grew up in a real place instead of wherever it what Missouri

1735
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
F*** you

1736
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,480
I know some of the walks out there know what I'm talking about

1737
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:04,064
There isn't there's a. In high school where there is orienteering

1738
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,088
And it is just

1739
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,880
Trying to get you to learn

1740
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,184
About compasses

1741
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
That sort of thing

1742
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,000
So you go to like a state park

1743
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
You're in a group

1744
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
For it's usually like

1745
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,864
Miami heat up formula

1746
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,168
What Woodway we had was three kids and two

1747
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:19,936
Parents

1748
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
Parents are just there to make sure everything is safe

1749
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,056
You and the kids are the parents

1750
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
Up with Muslim

1751
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
Yes

1752
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,432
But with the you know with the kids

1753
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,480
It's all up to them to use the compass

1754
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,760
Parents are supposed to help

1755
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,832
You got to find your way back to the point that you're supposed to

1756
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,648
It's so liberal it's awesome

1757
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,184
It was great except

1758
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
I was I was

1759
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,000
I was with a couple guys at

1760
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,632
The woods fun

1761
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,680
Your buddy

1762
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,496
No

1763
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
The reason I brought the

1764
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,544
Yes but Alex wants

1765
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,312
How to do that at 4

1766
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,872
That's the only reason I

1767
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,456
That was a long walk

1768
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Admit

1769
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:09,088
I just got wistful for orienteer missed the woods

1770
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,368
Yeah that's fine

1771
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,416
Going to be back in the water back in the woods

1772
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,440
And is next clip

1773
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Watch out for

1774
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,000
Alex Jones

1775
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
Is lying

1776
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
This is a lie

1777
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,104
No I understand they're there

1778
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,808
So

1779
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,624
Cookie infidel

1780
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
I mean this is the same delusional s*** that he says about globalist

1781
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,792
To sit next to him on planes and help

1782
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,352
I hate me but they were

1783
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
What the f*** are you talking about

1784
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,752
I mean when you have a made-up

1785
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,544
Fantasy world you're living in you just

1786
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Characters

1787
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,616
Put whatever we want

1788
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
But he's never said anything like that

1789
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,456
Before then radical Islam

1790
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
People

1791
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
Have

1792
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,784
They respected

1793
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,088
When is man

1794
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:13,856
When

1795
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,648
Having a conversation with these

1796
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
I'm playing

1797
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,024
Okay so don't know cuz he said he said on their main website

1798
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
Oh okay

1799
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,376
Maybe he's getting messages through website

1800
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
From Isis

1801
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,448
But say they respect him

1802
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Synonym like

1803
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,496
Bro

1804
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,544
We're going to get you

1805
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,592
Al-akhbar

1806
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:40,736
That's more logo

1807
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,808
Nuts yeah

1808
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:49,440
Looks like he's got a very John Wick kind of universe

1809
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,768
We all respect each other we're all International

1810
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Will kill each other for my

1811
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,096
Bonnie Brae

1812
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,848
Paul Joseph Watson

1813
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:10,688
A couple things about Paul Joseph Watson that's one of them

1814
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
The other thing is

1815
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,040
About a month ago you said he was quitting YouTube

1816
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,112
Because of the censorship I'm glad we never had this

1817
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,928
And everything is so terrible that he's got a quit

1818
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,792
It's now currently a month later he's

1819
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Still there

1820
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,352
Hasn't no ant

1821
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,888
You change the title of his

1822
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:34,752
Video that was about quitting YouTube to I won't be here much longer

1823
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
Also

1824
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,944
In April he said he was done with Donald Trump

1825
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,224
If he allowed

1826
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,064
Do you know him to get more involved in the Middle East

1827
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,928
Quit constantly.

1828
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:59,840
Where's Molly's wrong about everything he makes me sweeping pronouncement doesn't follow through with

1829
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
Eat so much paper

1830
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:08,288
Right I know it's probably make bold pronouncements he doesn't follow through

1831
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,872
Retention was like I'm quitting YouTube

1832
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,152
I'll be here for the

1833
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,456
Wheels fall off

1834
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
Yeah yeah

1835
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
Narrative

1836
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
Conservatives

1837
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
Trump supporters

1838
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,368
Are being targeted on YouTube

1839
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
Is patently false

1840
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,232
Is there argument hinges on the idea that their videos are being

1841
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,256
Demonetized

1842
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
What have you

1843
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Just happening to lots of a

1844
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
It's not happening

1845
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
Conservative accounts

1846
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,680
As we've talked about in the past

1847
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,776
The progressive liberal

1848
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,592
Broadcast also has had their videos demonic

1849
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,456
It's just something that YouTube is doing know whether it's right or wrong it's a whole nother thing

1850
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,992
But it's not targeted

1851
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,040
Also

1852
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
If they're trying to turn it into a TV

1853
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
Free platform

1854
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
Liberal talk

1855
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,976
Generally is

1856
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,768
Far more palatable van

1857
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,048
Muslims are trying to

1858
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:02,816
To kill you

1859
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,840
Let's Race

1860
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
I don't

1861
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,936
I think that's probably how everything is

1862
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,472
There's a left and a right

1863
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,544
Everybody's talking about

1864
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,824
They're saying

1865
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,176
Muslims should be killed in a large numbers

1866
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,200
Healthcare is good

1867
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:25,088
If I were an Advertiser

1868
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,368
What would I put up

1869
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,672
And I would drive

1870
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,720
Towards my dollars

1871
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,280
I was already

1872
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Weirdo who believes

1873
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,096
The Infowars

1874
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,936
I would never want to put my money behind

1875
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,984
Not being put off by

1876

The only reason to call Jose

01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
Start about it as be

1890
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Because

He makes a lot of money

1892
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,592
He makes a ton of money from it is

1893
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
He's afraid

1894
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,712
This thing this business that I have created

1895
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
People are starting

1896
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,576

1898
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136

1900
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:36,256
Too many liberals are he doesn't have his own thing I don't know why

1901
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
Paul Joseph Watson dozen

1902
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,400
He has a successful YouTube channel

1903
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Because

1904
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
He's sensational

1905
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
He's a bigot

1906
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,568
And he makes really fast cut videos

1907
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,848
Where you live really fast

1908
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
It's too late

1909
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,944
To look into it

1910
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,480
Cuz he's already onto another lie

1911
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,504
Right it's the classic

1912
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,040
Distraction tactic with fat

1913
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,064
Cut videos

1914
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,624
And you can just Jen up your base really hard with

1915
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Not hard to do

1916
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,440
Anyway

1917
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,488
Here's a clip of him

1918
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Complaining about Hillary

1919
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,864
You don't respond

1920
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,360
YouTube

1921
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,504
Get over it

1922
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,552
So the reason I wanted to

1923
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
Grating piece of

1924
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:36,160
Yeah I really don't like him but the reason I accept

1925
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
Cuz I want to point out that

1926
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
And don't do

1927
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,048
If you ever want to watch Paul Joseph Watson

1928
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,072
Videos

1929
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,888
90% of the points he tries to make

1930
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,680
Are on the back of a random

1931
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
People Twitter

1932
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:53,824
Like not celebrities Twitter's often he just has someone who I

1933
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,592
I have to assume

1934
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,616
100 followers

1935
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:58,432
Or something like that just a random person saying something

1936
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,480
DWP Mimi Mimi voice

1937
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:04,576
And then launches into his point that like how this person hates Trump

1938
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,136
So therefore everyone hates Trump

1939
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,976
Him saying that Hillary Clinton is bent out of shape about YouTube comment

1940
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,280
It doesn't hold water when the his journalistic

1941
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Standards are

1942
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,584
Random person

1943
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Twitter

1944
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,376
It just it's it's

1945
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,216
But again this is just pointing out hypocrisy and it doesn't

1946
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,056
31 more Clip Joint before we get out of here because

1947
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,592
Cuz I have not chosen

1948
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,640
To include any of the Adam Carolla business

1949
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,968
Cuz it's not really important the actual interview isn't

1950
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,504
It's not super offensive

1951
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,528
And it's not

1952
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:38,112
If Alex Jones talk to Adam Carolla

1953
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:44,768
A pre-recorded interview with even have proof that Adam Carolla knows that's going to be played on Infowars

1954
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,584
Right so it is a thing where it's like this is

1955
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,912
Tertiary

01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,192

Ancient Rome's clown with a stock called the stupidest

The court Jesters of medieval Europe were sanctioned way for people under the feudal thumb to laugh at the guys in charge

2034

Western Europe in Britain was one of

2037
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,712

There's a very

2046
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,608
Simple explanation for why

2047
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,888
People are afraid of clowns

2048
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,656

01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
But

2051
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,984
This stuff about these like

2052
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,520

The clowns

2059
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,480

01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,184
Witches dress

2065
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,976
Rabbis

2066
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,816
There's ritualize home in every religion there just is

2067
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,120
And if you look at like Native American

2068
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,912
Much more flamboyant

2069
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,704
Ceremonial dress

2070
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,752
You look at two cultures that

2071
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,520
Haven't

2072
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
I had their roots

2073
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
In West

2074
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
Cultures

2075
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:52,992
They generally do have more colorful looking like a terrible SNL sketch Pennywise the Pope

2076
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:57,088
Hair

2077
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,392
But like if you look at the the monks

2078
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,696
In Yemen there are in tobacco

2079
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:05,280
Very brightly colored ornamentation

2080
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:10,144
What I'm getting at is that all religion

2081
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,960
Completely separate tradition

2082
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
Then clown

2083
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Tradition

2084
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,776
Clown tradition

2085
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
Is

2086
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,592
This tradition of

2087
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,408
A pressure valve on a pressure cultures

2088
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
Clowns

2089
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,552
Are not the same thing as religion

2090
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,600
Just figures

2091
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,440
Come got it largely from that gesture roll after roll over

2092
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,744
The emperor has no clothes typeshift

2093
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,280
But the Dark Side of

2094
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,072
Clowns is actually pretty interesting

2095
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,608
When you get down to

2096
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Cuz it comes

2097
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
From one guy

2098
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,496
1

2099
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:51,360
The guy who is responsible for the modern-day clown that we know of

2100
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:57,504
Face paint all right before this guy

2101
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:03,648
Carnival clown with

2102
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,952
And the

2103
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,232
I can't remember the other word

2104
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:10,304
Terio.

2105
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,072
Alright whatever

2106
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,888
The that tradition does exist to but a lot of it come

2107
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
Comes from this guy

2108
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,936
It's from the mid-to-late seven

2109
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
1500

2110
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,984
Ended up dying in 80

2111
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:18,752
1837

2112
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,800
But he was

2113
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,592
Basically credited with the

2114
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,128
The modern-day clown

2115
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,920
He's a guy named Joseph Grimaldi

2116
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,480
And I heard that name before

2117
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
Yeah he was

2118
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,296
Give me the big

2119
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,320
The big clown

2120
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:37,440
Never say that again the thing is before that clowns were Side characters

2121
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,720
Stop that would come in

2122
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,488
To like

2123
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,256
Like in that

2124
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:48,192
The you have a very serious thing and then the clown will come in and just do it

2125
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,752
Joseph

2126
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,776
F*** this

2127
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,824
The clown is a star

2128
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,712
A massive star

2129
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,992
Clown front-and-center

2130
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,552
And he did all that like

2131
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,600
All that characters

2132
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,136
LV like

2133
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,672
The mohawk

2134
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
At sometime

2135
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:12,768
But

2136
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,328
Because Grimaldi was such a star

2137
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,608
The character he'd invented

2138
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,888
Can closely associate

2139
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
With him

2140
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,728
And Grimaldi's real life with anything--but comedy

2141
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:26,848
He grown up with a tyrant of a stage father he was prone to bouts of

2142
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,408
Depression his first wife died during childbirth

2143
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,992
His son was an alcoholic clown who drank himself to death by the age

2144
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
31

2145
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,576
Jesus and Grimaldi's physical gyration

2146
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
Dileep Santa

2147
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Violets elapsed

2148
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,648
Stick that it made him famous

2149
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,928
Left him in concert

2150
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:43,232
Pain it prematurely disabled right

2151
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:47,328
Ask her Baldi himself joked quote I'm Grim all day

2152
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
But I'll make you laugh at night

2153
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,168
Louis

2154
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,472
Grimaldi Grim all day

2155
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
But I'll make you laugh at night

2156
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,848
The road is not

2157
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:01,408
The Tears of a Clown

2158
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,968
Took that Grimaldi could make a joke about it

2159
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:04,736
Highlights

2160
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,296
How well did his tragic life was known to the audio

2161
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
The young Charles dick

2162
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
That's right

2163
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,584
After Grimaldi died penniless in an alcoholic in 1837

2164
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,376
The Quarry

2165
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:27,776
The coroner's verdict quote died by a visitation of God

2166
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Bethay

2167
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
Wonderful line

2168
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,504
At a terrible car

2169
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,088
He should be fired fired

2170
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:47,488
That man I want that on NCIS but actually the next time they have like the autopsy done there like he died

2171
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,792
Goddamn visitation

2172
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:53,632
Visitation of God so I will never solve this crime

2173
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,168
Alcoholic

2174
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:55,936
Dickens

2175
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:58,496
Was charged with editing Grimaldi's my memoirs

2176
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:01,312
Dickinson already hit upon his dissipated drunk

2177
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,360
Clown theme in his 1836

2178
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,128
The Pickwick

2179
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,432
In the serialized novel

2180
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:11,808
He describes an off-duty clown reportedly inspired by Grimaldi's drunk son who died at 31

2181
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,880
Who's Gastly wasted body

2182
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
Contrasted with his white face

2183
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,184
Clown costume

2184
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:21,280
Unsurprisingly Dickens version of Grimaldi's life was well

2185
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,048
Dickensian

2186
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,328
F-stop says

2187
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
Imposed

2188
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:27,424
Economy for every last Iraq from his audience

2189
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,704
Grimaldi's suffered

2190
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,472
Commensurate

2191
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,264
So

2192
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,592
Basically Charles Dickens took a lot of creative license

2193
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
With an already very

2194
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
Sad

2195
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,176
I drunk

2196
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:39,456
Clown story

2197
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:42,016
Katie created this mythology of

2198
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:47,136
This really f***** up clown behind the scenes of The Desperate sad person

2199
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,672
And people's imagination

2200
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
Ran wild with

2201
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:53,792
They created the archetype of drunk sad clown people

2202
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:58,144
Made even more artistic representations of it after Charles Dickens

2203
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,704
Took license with

2204
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,728
Joseph Grimaldi

2205
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
Right

2206
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,800
So beyond that also people

2207
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:08,384
I think they've done studies on psych to percent of the population is

2208
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,408
Sincerely

2209
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,688
Afraid of clowns

2210
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
And the rest

2211
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:19,648
The second most people grow out of it but everybody is afraid of clowns

2212
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
To some extent

2213
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
Because

2214
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,792
Well it's

2215
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,328
Because they remind us of

2216
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,096
People that they are now

2217
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:30,912
Well there's that but also children are afraid of like

2218
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,728
El characters at Disneyland 2

2219
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,752
The people in suits

2220
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:35,776
Costumes

2221
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,568
And stuff like that universe

2222
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,848
Sleep scares children because

2223
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:43,712
And their brains can't process exactly until the age of like three or four

2224
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,248
You maybe even later than that

2225
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
Children

2226
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:48,576
Tell what's fantasy and what's reality

2227
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:52,160
It's so this idea of these overblown characters

2228
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,976
They just think they're real

2229
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,768
And it's scary to children

2230
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:00,096
And some people don't grow out of that

2231
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:03,168
Exactly

2232
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
As a comedian

2233
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,520
Right Alex Jones

2234
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,336
His version of history of clowns

2235
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,128
Very not text Babe

2236
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:16,480
Conn's drink blood

2237
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
I want to be totally clear

2238
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,088
If you say that you're afraid of clowns

2239
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,112
I'm going to take you

2240
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:22,880
Clown

2241
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:25,696
And if you're not scared of that clown

2242
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,488
If you're not scared of that clown

2243
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
F*** you

2244
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,584
Because I

2245
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:32,864
Ice

2246
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:37,472
Hey you guys both very serious I hate people who claim to be scared of clowns

2247
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,520
Because it's become a social meme

2248
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:43,360
Yeah become a way of replacing actually having a personality

2249
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:46,432
You just like I'm scared of clowns Isn't that cool

2250
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
It's the same people who are like

2251
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
I think

2252
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,016
Moist is a gross word

2253
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,296
Oh you're f****** interest

2254
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:56,416
You came up with that yea or people who are like Oxford,

2255
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:03,584
Like all that stuff is just short-handed people have like now granted the Oxford, at least is a real thing

2256
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,168
English major

2257
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:09,216
I know about the subjunctive

2258
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,496
I thought about that

2259
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,520
Right because

2260
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:14,592
Greek and it's an actual

2261
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:20,992
Comes from eating and drinking blood now where is that to be true of using the subjunctive

2262
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:25,600
But like all of this stuff I really think is a is

2263
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
The dangerous

2264
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:31,232
Trend in society that we see where people just take shortcuts into creating personality

2265
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,328
No I think it is a trap

2266
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
And

2267
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
Full disclosure

2268
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,936
I tried to do a bit about this background

2269
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,640
So do it now in the appropriate I can pull the pieces of information out of it and never conversation

2270
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:50,176
Salt Lake I think

2271
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,456
Originally

2272
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,504
The olden time

2273
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
There were

2274
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,088
Like memes

2275
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
Like

2276
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
I could tell you but I'd have to kill you

2277
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,208
Little catchphrases

2278
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:02,976
Jokes

2279
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
Dallas Mavericks

2280
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,560
You have those

2281
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,352
That are just verbal

2282
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632
Little indication

2283
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
But like

2284
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,424
I got the

2285
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:16,032
How many other about

2286
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,056
Shared

2287
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:17,824
Whatever

2288
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,104
That's one

2289
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,152
Stuff like that

2290
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:24,992
Like I could tell you but it it's Kelly I don't know why that's the only example I'm coming up with

2291
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:25,760
But it's

2292
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,552
Perfect for what I'm talking about

2293
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,088
Or rectum almost killed him

2294
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,136
Rectum damn near killed

2295
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
Right

2296
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,976
The funniest thing in the world but

2297
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
Based on

2298
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,048
Your response

2299
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,328
It proves my point

2300
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,888
Verbal memes

2301
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:43,936
Sprite but they don't indicate

2302
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,704
Personality

2303
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
Necessarily

2304
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,776
I'm scared of clowns

2305
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:48,800
He's trying to

2306
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,848
To put something about yourself

2307
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,128
Into a verbal mean

2308
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
And that to me is

2309
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,176
Is pathetic

2310
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,456
Anderson evolution

2311
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:58,272
It's an evolution of just saying a catchphrase

2312
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
Anything like

2313
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,832
I want this catchphrase.

2314
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,856
Say something

2315
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
Deep about myself

2316
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,672
That isn't true

2317
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,720
You're just picking up Social

2318
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,744
Cuter

2319
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:11,584
I don't know I don't know if it matters but it really bothers me

2320
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Describe High School

2321
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,400
But I'm talking about adults

2322
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,216
I mean High School

2323
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:18,752
It should

2324
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,288
Adult

2325
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
The adulterer

2326
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,336
Just as dumb as

2327
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:26,944
I disagree. I do not think it is a new trend

2328
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
That's all

2329
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:32,064
I don't think people are dumb and they always have babies

2330
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,464
Evolution of that verbal meme s*** and I f****** hate it really deal with the fact

2331
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,000
Internet

2332
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,792
So

2333
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,400
Sigalert put the graphical

2334
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:51,520
Start

2335
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:01,504
Hey honestly I can't tell what you're making fun of Isaac everything and nothing at all

2336
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Hilarious and we should all

2337
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
II

2338
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,856
Memes are happy get over it

2339
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
That's right I'm Lenny Bruce on the site ask people to come up with your own personalities

2340
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:16,096
That you think it is

2341
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,120
Alright

2342
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:20,192
Let me get started on listicles okay

2343
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:26,592
If you can actually write an article if you got to have number one you're joking

2344
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:32,992
Bored

2345
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,320
Why not just let people do their dumb s***

2346
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:41,952
Because I think at the end of the day if people stop doing dumb s*** that they didn't need to do

2347
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,256
Maybe it would give them time

2348
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
Come up with

2349
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Sincere

2350
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,864
Deeply found personalities and that might fit

2351
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,424
Fix the world

2352
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:56,288
Did Alex Jones thinks that Trump yelling at football players taking a knee is going to save the country

2353
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,848
I argue that maybe everyone finding their sins

2354
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:04,480
Answer your core of their Humanity that could save the country

2355
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:08,576
Is pretty obvious which is hard that maybe there is

2356
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,952
Or maybe I did something that I don't want to find out

2357
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,024
Maybe I find out that I have been a bad person

2358
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,840
Let me tell you I

2359
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:24,448
Not a good day but it is

2360
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:26,240
So there's that

2361
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:27,520
Anyway

2362
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:31,360
There's nothing really to be afraid of as long as you are open

2363
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,456
Open towards progress

2364
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:38,528
Self-help

2365
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,576
On today's show

2366
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,904
That is probably true yes

2367
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,208
Or we labeled it like clickbait like

2368
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:49,280
I'm leaving YouTube f*** you Jeff Paul Joseph Watson

2369
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:52,096
Anyway if you want to find no clickbait and no memes

2370
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:58,496

Does not have any means but

2372
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,688
Flicka bleed and still does poles from time

2373
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,736
The time is at knowledge underscore

2374
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,296
Baby

2375
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:15,136

Or you could watch it on Twitch which is

2378
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,744

And I intermittently on the weekends whenever we

01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:39,968
Depending on how things

Ending so I very close tonight

01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,928
I'll be back to broke here very shortly

2390
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:59,168
But until then we'll have some guests toast

2391
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,192
It'll be fun

2392
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,008
But I want to say this

2393
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,080
Do you know this.

2394
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,872
I'm sorry I think it's time

2395
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,152
How to get rid of the Rapaport

2396
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,456
Cuz

2397
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
He sucks

2398
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,760
Okay but he sucks

2399
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,808
But he's not really as much of a villain

2400
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:20,672
Like that kind of the fun of the b no I

2401
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:24,512
I don't know what the green want to sleep don't know what the fun of the baby.

2402
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,304
I have no idea

2403
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,352
But look here

2404
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,120
Here's the thing

2405
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
Yes

2406
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
I've been

2407
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:34,496
Wrestling with the fact that like I watched a bunch of John Rappaport stuff

2408
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,544
Yeah I really all he does is a

2409
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,080
Anti vaxxer don't trust

2410
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:38,848
Madison

2411
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,384
Type stuff

2412
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,688
Really

2413
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,224
You big bad

2414
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:48,064
The biggest villain of this whole thing it's not even Alex Jones

2415
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
It is

2416
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,416
Larry Nichols

2417
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,440
Is the

2418
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,744
You're going to the phone

2419
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:04,960
The biggest problem of all of these people

2420
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,288
So I think at the end of our show a sign of really should be

2421
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,824
Something to do with how he should

2422
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,408
I do so

2423
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,528
You have to admit at least say you're on the air

2424
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:19,552
And word according

2425
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,648
This is scaring me so much

2426
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,696
I am freaking out

2427
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:50,016
That's the answering machine we can't broadcast his number

2428
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,368
That's right

2429
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,648
Son-of-a-b****

2430
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:59,744
But you know what he didn't answer his phone if that means

2431
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,792
This is harassing

2432
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,864
I called him twice that's harassing

2433
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,632
F*** you

2434
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568
That are here

2435
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
Freaking me out

2436
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
The phone

2437
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,176
If you didn't have his f******

2438
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
Phone number there

2439
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,712
Leave a message

2440
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
But

2441
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,808
I could like mute your mic.

2442
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,136
He's not going to

2443
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:36,608
New viewers look seriously he is the villain

2444
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:43,008
He's and now that we have evidence of him blackmailing Congress on are we really need to make more of a

2445
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:43,776
Concerted effort

2446
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,800
P******

2447
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
Show is about

2448
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:48,128
Like documenting Alex Jones

2449
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,920
Clouded on his dumbass

2450
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,480
Honestly think we should try

2451
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,760
To take down Larry Nichols

2452
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:58,880
Like honestly I think that should be a much bigger focus of what we do

2453
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:05,280
We have evidence of him committing a felony on are we have evidence that all of his s*** for the last 18 years has been la

2454
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:11,936
To go to prison

2455
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,728
It is a foreign National

2456
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,776
The end of Die Hard

2457
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:18,336
No we can't we can't mess with Alexander Dugan

2458
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,616
Come on it's been revoked

2459
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:26,528
No he's not diplomatically immune

2460
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,808
Skyping from Russia

2461
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
It's been revoked

2462
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:34,464
Under Section I'm just trying to reference the greatest moment in movie history

2463
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:41,376
Nichols needs to be our Focus as opposed to John Rappaport

2464
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,680
And so that is my point

2465
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:48,032
At the end of our show we should tell Larry Nichols

2466
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:48,800
Himself

2467
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,616
Yeah but do you know

2468
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:53,152
Do you know what I'm

2469
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,432
Really frustrated by

2470
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
I'd love for you to Aaron

2471
02:01:55,712 --> 02:02:00,064
Any grievances really all of the the argument

2472
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:03,904
Is made is really Jon rappoport

2473
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,952
Go fuc yourself

2474
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:14,656
