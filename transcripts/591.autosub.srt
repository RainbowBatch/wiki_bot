1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
Hey buddy

6
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,792
Alex

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
June

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Indeed we are.

9
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,776
I think we talked about the recent episode

11
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
Survivor no collector itch

12
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Oh yes

13
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
That got into my head a little bit

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,528
And I started to think about

15
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Card Collector

16
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,208
I do I don't want stamps maybe I do but I don't actually

17
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,096
Just trying to think of like a way that I could productively and not like a belief self-destructive lie

18
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
Explore some of these tendencies

19
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Got a game

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
That's like a deck building game

21
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,152
Okay okay game called

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Okay

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
It's a lot of fun

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
I think

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,392
I do brakes but I guess is like exploring these genres of games that I'd never really played all that much and

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
I dig it

27
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
Yeah there's a lot of this lot of fun

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
Different play styles of games up there that

29
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Attacking but can bring a lot to your life in

30
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
I don't know I'm

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
I'm really worried that I'm going to end up finding

32
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Some

33
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,568
Really in-depth deck-building game and then I'm done

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
You're just going to get way too into online gwent

35
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
And then it's over it's possible I mean that was

36
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Is one of the first like

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
They thought you had no no like one of the first instances of like who like

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Just do this for a while

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,256
Like when I was playing The Witcher

40
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,352
Holding lady totally this is a sub game in the game tonight

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
Kind of like more

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
I've gotten too good at this there are

43
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Players in the game that I can actually

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
It's not satisfying

45
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Hundred hours like yeah it's not

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,808
That was that was the start of the root of it could be the problem

47
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,672
Blossoming into an addiction will find out help so

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
How to keep with the theme you've got your cards similar

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
We got a new board game called wingspan

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Okay it's kind of like a it's like a resource game like Settlers of Catan and all that stuff

51
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
But it is just

52
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Gorgeous

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Just like it is

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Hand-painted

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
I have anybody you know this like beautiful artwork

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
Cupboards and and it's just about

57
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Collecting

58
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,672
It's gorgeous it's just it's really really cool

59
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
It's better than what I thought it was going to be in

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Wingspan is just like

61
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Hold your arms out long

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Get out of there

63
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
The fun game out of there

64
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,776
I'm going to set a fire just to make sure that you mean it when you jump out of the window

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
So Jordan today what we're doing is we're going back to

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
The past

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
So this is a recording

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Couple days before

69
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
We would normally have right so if anything happened

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
In the very recent

71
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
We don't know about

72
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
Yeah cuz it hasn't happened yet

73
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
When we recorded

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
In some ways you are hearing us

75
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
In the past

76
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Talk about the past

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
And that's we are even

78
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
Less capable of responding to the usual yes

79
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
We're doing we're going back to June 11th

80
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055

One of the worst

96

Heroin

Freakishly large

109
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
I know that's a Biblical reference

110
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
But it

111
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
What's what

112
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735

00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Play album

114
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,367

I was not a Jars of Clay head no no no no my jars

You lift me up so

122

124
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Tickling my fancy

00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
At least three different Vibes alright

127
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079

00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Not it

129
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
I wonder if that's something

130
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Another

131
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015

132
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319

To hang out with all of these animals at the same time when I sleep

139

This is absolutely a

184
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
Huge sign pointing toward believing in the devil

185
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,087
You bet we work makes considerable progress in that investigation

00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
Exposition of this are used to the car we're going to get into the Iraq War and how the globalist want to attack all these other countries also by weird

189
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,703
Greg Roberts went to heaven

190
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Ensuite that is

191
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Two of the most

192
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,663
Stories happening today yeah so Alex is not

193
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Unfamiliar

194
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
With this kind of thing

195
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,855
Dying and coming back

196
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Paranormal

197
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
Wait about 20 years

198
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Job

199
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Knocked Up

200
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Believe

201
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Medical don't believe

202
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
In the afterlife

203
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
Really excited when he get into some of his experiences because based on

204
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
To the present day stuff

205
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
You've got to have a lot of stuff

206
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
That should have already happened a few years when he was younger

207
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
Was tried to tried to induct him into this High called

208
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Yahoo satanism

209
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,559
He had God give him a panoramic 360 view of everything

210
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,679
It was going to happen that they would guide him through his future

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
I'm excited to hear him

212
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
Say exactly what he says now she isn't that right I'm really excited because this is some

213
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
World-changing s*** and I will remember it forever if God literally came to me and you can either

214
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,391
You can either make the argument that if he doesn't get into a lot of the stuff that he talks about in the present then

215
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,279
Either he doesn't want to talk about it on air because he's all comfortable with it

216
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Right

217
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
Or he's come up with all that stuff

218
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Since this point backstory

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Benefit of the doubt

220
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
Going to say that he's yet

221
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
5 years

222
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,247
5 years into this show you certainly should still be giving him a bit

223
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,855
Jeff Fairman so

224
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
Craig Roberts is one of Alex's weirdo friends

225
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
You forgot who died and came back

226
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
He's a guy who

227
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,887
I don't ever hear Alex talk about anymore

228
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
Never knew who this guy was until I started going back to 2000

229
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,359
3 and he's everywhere that she was lousy with Craig Roberts in the past

230
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
But he is not somebody who

231
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
You even be really familiar with

232
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
Gation no I don't know if he's dead I tried to sort that out

233
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
He died by his own

234
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Storiesig

235
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,863
Wouldn't be surprised if it happened again I wonder how many times you can come back before you have to

236
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,495
Just say okay that's number for you're here for good

237
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,823
Yeah it's a three-strikes-you're-out policy

238
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
This is better what happened

239
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,247
Weather for when I worked at the movie theater you know like if you want left the theater to go to the bathroom you get back in

240
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
With your stuff you know

241
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
What are somebody's going and out of the theater like 10 times

242
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,535
Is it I feel like heaven father the same way

243
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
So

244
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,143
Craig Roberts died and went to heaven Alex's uncle

245
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Also had a little bit of an

246
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Experience and if you thought

247
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
These not the numbers were weird

248
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Okay

249
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
His job

250
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
6.

251
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
When he was

252
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Died

253
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
On the way to the hospital

254
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
And I

255
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
Zf6 times man six times

256
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
6 x 6 x 8 long ambulance ride

257
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
Way that you do not walk away with permanent brain damage from that

258
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Have you Larry something along those lines

259
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
I guess what kind of lens

260
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Credibility to

261
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Dying 6 times

262
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Dying six times are coming back

263
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
In a ambulance ride

264
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,287
That's ridiculous

265
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
What counts as dying

266
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
Definitely don't

267
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783
I want to know I need specifics on when you know your daddy's their brain activity or is it just hard

268
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
Is it what are we talkin about

269
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
There is a

270
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
There's no scientific

271
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Which kind of does make it a little bit more difficult

272
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
I do believe however that the proof is in the Stars

273
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
Edit is in the leaves around us

274
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
That obviously this was full brain-dead

275
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Alex's uncle's in the

276
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
The

277
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
The ambulance

278
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Humble

279
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
I'm back

280
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
3/52

281
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,911
So before we get into this interview Alex does have to talk about some

282
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
Now that I think about it somebody's in the ambulance

283
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,871
There's a there's an emt-b really said I just imagined the band like at the beginning

284
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
I will bring you back to the number 6

285
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,599
Jesus Christ I don't even know if we need to do this anymore Bruce Lee pmt's in there that like

286
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
I am

287
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
Magic's

288
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Everytime I touch this band

289
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
How does a B-2 get your next

290
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
Person you're picking up who doesn't come back

291
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Configure

292
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
So there's some

293
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Quite alright

294
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
Real world issue

295
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Use the even get to before we get to heaven

296
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
One of them has to

297
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Do with

298
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Taxation

299
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Of cars

300
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Albion radio

301
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,223
So Alex is making a prediction that within a couple years the entire United

302
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
What states will have

303
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
Tracking things in cars so

304
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
There will be a system

305
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
The text

306
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Cuz you buy them

307
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Sure

308
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
2006

309
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
I don't think that

310
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,215
Maybe I once managed to save the world from this one cuz it did not deny.

311
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
2021 article in the washer

312
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
2 States currently are trying out this sort of the policy as an alternative to taxing gasoline

313
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
He was just a decade behind on his planets

314
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
The question is why would a

315
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,183
State want to explore the possibility of Shifting have taxes are levied and measured

316
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
It's because of emerging Technologies and things like the idea of hydrogen powered cars that hypothetically

317
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Don't need gas

318
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,447
If he's become larger and larger parts of the market space

319
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
What ends up happening is the

320
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Midstates face

321
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Huge financial

322
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
Cars are still using the road

323
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
What's the upkeep of which

324
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,711
Is funded by tax revenues but the drivers are no longer paying gas taxes

325
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Which made up a large

326
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Which part of the pot

327
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
Their number solutions that have been floated in terms of how to deal with this inevitable issue but the mileage based taxation is one of the ideas

328
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
It gets talked about the most

329
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
Partially because it covers a lot of the relevant variables

330
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
And the plan seems like it could be implemented in a way

331
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
That would cost the average driver app

332
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
Approximately the same about

333
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,727
Has gas taxes ended up in Keurig on them

334
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
No granted

335
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Gas taxes are levied against

336
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Do you like wholesalers

337
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
Amana trickled down to the Geico commercial

338
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
But the amount of expense would be fairly similar to most average drivers

339
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
Just buy it are people who drive

340
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Like

341
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
Completely fuel-efficient cars

342
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
That much

343
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Gas tanks

344
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Sure.

345
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,167
Utah and Oregon I've already put programs in place to ship things in this direction

346
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,543
And there are folks working on it in various places around the country but it's nothing at all like Alex's describing

347
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,895
The Oregon program was launched in 2015 and it was voluntary

348
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
To participate

349
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
According to the Washington Post

350
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,599
Legislators and Salem are considering a bill that would make the program mandatory for new vehicles with a fuel economy rating

351
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
House 30 miles per gallon or higher

352
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Starting in 2026

353
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
But still even in the future even like a progressive

354
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Gas tax

355
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
If you will

356
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
You could look at it that way

357
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
How this article

358
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Explains the system as it works

359
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
In Oregon

360
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Quote

361
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
Participants in the state have three ways to sign up

362
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,407
Privately-run systems and one administered by the State Department of Transportation

363
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Private companies send drivers a device that logs where and how much they drive or pull the data directly from

364
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Vehicles

365
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Then they send bills

366
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Turn over the revenue to the state

367
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Drivers get reimbursed

368
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
For gas taxes that they pay at the pump

369
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Okay

370
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
So that's the way that the system

371
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,423
Right there trying to eat their trying to see if it equals out or if there is a loss

372
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Still or Thursday is

373
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,823
And then they're like concerns you know about privacy obviously

374
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
People can opt out of having their information

375
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Capital

376
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
A reality that

377
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,599
Technology is advancing and non-gas consuming cars are more fuel-efficient cars are becoming more and more prevalent

378
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
Simultaneously the system we've built in order to keep our roads

379
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
Safe and driveable relies on tax revenues that come from gas sales

380
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,399
The discussion about alternative modes of Taxation or just a discussion about how we can adapt to new better cars

381
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
Will simultaneously continuing to publicly fund

382
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Nothing cards

383
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Need to drive on

384
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:04,127
Even so even proponents of this kind of plant except there are real challenges

385
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
In terms of putting it

386
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
In place

387
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
For instance like I said the gas tax itself has collect

388
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Wholesalers

389
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
Minutes passed down to Consumers indirectly

390
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:18,720
Where's this new plan would require many more employees to be in like collection type position add a lot of

391
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
Exedy to the

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
The way that this was

393
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
Collected anybody even proponents of the plan

394
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Don't recognize like

395
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
That's Tuff

396
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
The infrastructure on this is going to be difficult to figure out because we're creating it as we go it's a brand-new system

397
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
That nobody's ever even tried

398
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,200
It's going to be a challenge doesn't mean it's impossible they're probably some hiccups

399
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,040
I guess it's Alex would prefer maybe there's a

400
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
About

401
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
Taking blood making up attack somewhere else

402
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Second property or sales taxes

403
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Poquito for those plans either

404
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
I think he's a

405
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Against

406
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Taxes

407
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,168
A plan and that's fine on his show because if you're listening to the show you actually haven't heard Alex

408
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Explain what the problem is

409
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,032
Why people are discussing the ideas he's ranting about

410
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
It's fine to be opposed to this

411
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Proposed system but it's

412
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
It's not really okay to just pretend there's no reason

413
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Did anyone would want to try it other than

414
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
To track-and-trace everyone

415
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Yeah that's not

416
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Did the relevant

417
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,416
Part of the conversation the entire reason the conversations happen

418
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Right yeah I mean

419
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,304
My plan would be to probably

420
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
Forcibly dissolve most oil companies and then reallocate those resources that I have take

421
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Taken 2

422
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,080
Employ the employees that used to work for them as well as rebuild

423
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
See I don't know is that necessarily is a self

424
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Perpetuating

425
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
I don't know if that's going to be a renewable pot of

426
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Time to figure out the renewable pot

427
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
It's all about buying time right now that's what I'm about

428
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Actually made me think of

429
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
How Alex

430
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
Was talk talk about the bubonic

431
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,312
Plague in the present-day he has a bit of an another Health scare

432
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Betty wants

433
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
People to be aware of

434
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,568
Confirmed

435
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
The outbreak

436
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Abilene report

437
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
To give you some context

438
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,528
SARS outbreak is still currently active at this point

439
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
June

440
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
The World Health Organization didn't announce who was

441
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Contained until July

442
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
So

443
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
It seems like

444
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,488
Monkeypox

445
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
Look over here

446
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
It's weird

447
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,192
This outbreak in 2003 monkeypox was interesting only because it was the first time an outbreak

448
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Kid ever been reported outside of Africa

449
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,848
Investigators believe that the outbreak traced back to a gambian giant rat

450
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,920
Who infected a shipment of prairie dogs who have been gone on

451
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
To get some people

452
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
God damn those

453
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Gambian rats

454
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
There was no human-to-human transmission and no doubt

455
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
The CDC did their job at Raystown the animal shipments and put out guidance

456
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
For people who may have come in contact

457
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280
Prairie dogs recently to keep an eye out for symptoms

458
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
Since this outbreak there has been one case of

459
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
Confirm monkeypox in the United States

460
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,984
And it was a person who travel to the US from Nigeria this year

461
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
Where they've gotten sick initially and I come

462
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:50,176
Yeah it is much as it offers an opportunity to learn about public health responses that might

463
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Go unnoticed generally

464
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,832
Or it could even be a good chance to discuss other needs to be better regulation in the exotic pet trade

465
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
But ultimately this is a low-priority story

466
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,536
You have no idea why Alex is spending so much time he is liking reads almost this entire article

467
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,120
I mean it's I guess because he likes a monkey box

468
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:14,496
That does sound reasonable to me it's kind of fun to say monkeypox

469
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
You have a decent Theory

470
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
It's as good as anything from him yeah I was confused because you did seem to be spending a lot of time on this

471
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
Disgusting

472
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
I realized

473
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Did I have found

474
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
A hole in the space-time continuum

475
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Emma government

476
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
Dallas to Denver

477
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
We will lock down

478
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Will forcibly inoculate you

479
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,176
We will go to Red Alert you will be considered an anime

480
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
A martial law

481
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Carpal

482
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
The program

483
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
We've got the funk

484
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
I can't find the article are the interview talking about

485
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Save these cities were

486
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
We're going to be hit with

487
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
Smallpox sure there was a risk of it

488
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
Like I can find interviews and speeches that he gave

489
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
Dating back to like 2001 where

490
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
You know the idea of someone release

491
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
Smallpox is something that is a fear of hit

492
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
But larger picture

493
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,480
This is just the exact same story Alex is telling in the present day but with the

494
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
The details swapped out like it's a madlib

495
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
All this just overlaps with the present-day in a way that does

496
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Bolster Alex's credibility would actually

497
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
Anyone who thinks he knows what he's talkin about think

498
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Twice

499
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,096
The claim that 99.999% of healthcare worker is in

500
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
Cops and whatever

501
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
They'll refuse the small pack

502
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Fox vaccine

503
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
That's the inciting incident

504
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
In the 2003 version of this narrative

505
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
This isn't true

506
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
We talked about it on a recent 2003 episode

507
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,736
Rizzoli Bush Administration initiative post 9/11

508
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
We wanted to vaccinate 500,000

509
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Frontline worker

510
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Workers against smallpox

511
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Ultimately only vaccinating about 40,000

512
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
Because people didn't see the need for it as

513
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,512
People with autism

514
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
Although that number is low Alex's figure is way off

515
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
The present-day parallel this is the 2019 vaccine safety Summit where Alex claims that the globalist doctors

516
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,616
We're worried that the jig was up in the Frontline doctors were getting suspicious and wobbly on vaccines

517
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,200
These two events are severely misrepresented by Ali

518
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
The reason that the bad guys had to act

519
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Now

520
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
They had to do this now

521
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,928
Because everyone was refusing the vaccine right in 2003

522
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
And in 2019 the word the doctors are getting wobble

523
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Explain the events

524
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Did Alex's now covering his news

525
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
The source of monkeypox popping up

526
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,264
How to scare people in 2003 is the equivalent of the initial covid outbreak in 20

527
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
The inciting incident happened which required the globalist

528
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
What are plans in motion to scare the pub

529
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
In the back clip

530
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,576
Alex even uses the same goals videoscribe to the bad guys now lockdown cities Forest vaccines martial law

531
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,696
It's tempting to look at the consistency that exists here with his fears and convince yourself that he was onto something

532
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
That's missing the bigger picture

533
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,864
This isn't a prediction that Alex amazed that he ended up being right about in 2021

534
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,472
It's ridiculous Megan involves his interpretation of the world in 2003 and he was

535
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Wrong

536
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Total b*******

537
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,616
When you see him repeating the game of the present-day that's all he's doing

538
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,456
Except this time the stakes are way higher because covid was a big deal

539
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
And it wasn't handled as responsibly as other outbreaks

540
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
To the past that I was his fear Monger to Boughton profited off of

541
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,160
In 2003 Alex knows the monkeypox

542
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
Smallpox aren't real threats mostly thanks to widespread vaccination campaign

543
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
And that's what works best for him

544
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
That's The Sweet Spot

545
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,912
It needs to be not an actual problem

546
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,544
Business works best when there's no actual pandemic there's just the insinuation of 1 and Rising vaccine rate

547
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,872
Happening which is what the globalist

548
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
The ark

549
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
2003 is almost certainly would Alex always wants yeah

550
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,064
2020 and the way this is gone is a mess

551
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Steak

552
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
For him

553
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
This is this is no good

554
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,232
It's also really really important to remember that

555
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
The reason he's describing the lockdowns and all of that stuff

556
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Is because that's what you

557
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Have to do

558
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
When an outbreak gets out of control at all we've seen it to be embellished exaggerated version of what you have to do

559
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Exactly

560
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
And

561
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
That didn't happen B

562
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Because of

563
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Anybody

564
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,528
Other than the people who listen to the people like Alex Jones

565
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
It's it's self-perpetuating in some ways were so encouraging if they

566
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,072
You didn't act like they idiots they are so it's it's not that he's right about something it said he

567
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
He's very worldview

568
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Predicates

569
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
This happen

570
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,520
Well it's it is really bizarre thing that I'm thinking about as I listen to this and it's like

571
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
The thing is that

572
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Works the best

573
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Is

574
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:43,456
A functioning CDC people following Public Health guidance

575
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
Alex yelling about how it's b*******

576
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Joanne retainment

577
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
Newton on the folks who are

578
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Arise wide-open and

579
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,584
They gave him money for his dumb s***

580
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
But they live alone

581
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,240
Weird people who sponsored

582
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,312
So you have that and I think that is kind of

583
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Of balance

584
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,896
That can exist

585
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Probably would

586
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,272
Think that's a preferable State of Affairs because this is easy to go back on

587
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
He's right here in 2003

588
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
When smallpox and Munch

589
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
Monkeypox don't end up becoming a big deals I don't become

590
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,744
Something that is a a massive outbreak

591
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,888
It's great cuz then you know people are getting vaccinated and you look at they tried to scare you into it with stars

592
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
There's no

593
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
Lost that wasn't already lost

594
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Like you're just going to

595
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
I don't know

596
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
Convince anti-vax people to be anti-vax

597
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Stable

598
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
In some ways

599
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
But now in 2021

600
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
How do you go back you can go back

601
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
It's too late it's too late

602
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
I mean it's just

603
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Just that

604
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
F***** up like

605
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Everybody

606
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
On the far right

607
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,352
Is so much better off whenever they're nowhere near making any decision

608
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
We talked about that like a very early episode

609
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
Sing about s*** that isn't a problem and you can bother yourselves yet I think I think a big part of that is that

610
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
Last couple decades in particular but also

611
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah going back even further than that I think the conservative

612
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Sort of

613
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,672
That the media sphere especially

614
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Has been characterized

615
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Just that they've gotten the most traction out of

616
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Being like

617
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,728
Agitating and opposition does not really work all that well when they're in

618
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Aether there's power

619
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
It has to be against something

620
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,408
Right I mean you can't untie the like

621
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,968
Late 70s Rebirth of the

622
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Conservative dumb dumb

623
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
As as

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Thought leader

625
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
From

626
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
The beginnings of

627
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,488
Which people going all hog-wild and trying to exacerbate income inequality

628
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
And as you see the quality of life go down for these people

629
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
They get more and more Angry combine that with

630
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
A media sphere that's feeding them

631
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,544
Terrible information and making them angry at the wrong people and we see

632
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
How

633
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Billionaires in babe

634
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
Billy Brown over the past summer years

635
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
You know it's just

636
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
It's babe it's created

637
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
It's manufac

638
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
And then it's perpetuated by itself

639
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
You know

640
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,184
And the other the other point that I wanted to make two is that

641
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,792
Like what I hear Alex doing dozen 2003 and think about

642
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Like the way he's behaved

643
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
2020

644
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Like

645
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
I see it as like a

646
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,496
Just a gamble that he does it always paid off in the past

647
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
And this time did not

648
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Yeah they this time

649
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
There was an actual

650
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Real Public Health crisis

651
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
It was mishandled

652
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
People responded to it poorly

653
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
And

654
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
In the past

655
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
That is not been the case

656
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
It's worked out

657
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
To maintain

658
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Balance

659
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
Before and this time

660
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
It's just completely out of whack

661
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Yep

662
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Yep the whole world sucked

663
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Well

664
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
The good news is we learn about heaven

665
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
We're not there yet

666
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Alex's Pizza

667
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
Who calls before Craig Roberts shows up

668
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Atlanta this one caller

669
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
I wonder if you can answer this for our

670
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
This caller asks if Alex

671
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
Meditate

672
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
What do you think dance

673
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:35,392
I'm going to say that the answer is prayer is meditation my friends

674
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
What do you think

675
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
The most power

676
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
And

677
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
No I don't matter

678
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
The reason I

679
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
I can see

680
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Will

681
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
R-Truth

682
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
And

683
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
My whole life

684
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Afraid

685
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
The man or whatever you want to call

686
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
In my opinion the truth

687
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
No matter how

688
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Strong someone else

689
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Never impose

690
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Real control on me

691
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Like maybe

692
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Translate

693
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
Shut up heavy

694
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,464
Everything you believe it listen I think you're coming at this from a good place but everything you believe is Ben

695
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
Alive meant to trick you

696
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
Meditate all you f******

697
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
I believe in self-empowerment but only if you're gone

698
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
Great if I wanted to breathe in and breathe out I would be

699
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,616
We doing it while I'm at the firing range so here's here's where we get to Craig Roberts

700
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Colonel Craig Rob

701
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
This is comic

702
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
Akon

703
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
And I want to talk

704
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
The government

705
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,648
Cars

706
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
5 hours driving

707
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
About how

708
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
So this is just

709
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Hilarious

710
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
And in many ways

711
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,136
The big thing I think is really funny is just that side-by-side

712
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
We're going to talk about geopolitics

713
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
What it's like in heaven

714
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Yeah

715
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
Yeah yeah yeah

716
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,216
It's a little bit difficult to take anybody seriously whenever they're due

717
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Netflix

718
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
The religious local news version of like that's

719
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,664
That's like in and after this we've got the kitten that can't be stopped

720
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
Get that kind of think I want to be clear to like

721
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
I think it's a lot of people have

722
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Sort of

723
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
Maybe we could call it Mystikal

724
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Experiences or something

725
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,816
Transcendence sure means a lot to them personally impugn anybody for whatever they take

726
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
From whatever experience

727
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
They have

728
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
I would not

729
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Take seriously bickering

730
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
About

731
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Like

732
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
If I hadn't

733
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Experience have you had an experience

734
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
We went to a place and I had a detail about

735
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,712
The place

736
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
And we argued about

737
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
I think

738
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
That that's

739
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Dumb

740
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,464
I like getting into too many specifics or taking anything to literally is kind of dumb

741
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
And

742
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
I think that's what they're

743
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
Yeah I mean somebody sent me some of that that clip of what's his dumbfucks sayings

744
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
God can't hear prayers through a mask

745
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
Sono

746
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,432
If you if you are at the place where you have to say

747
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
God can hear prayers through it

748
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
You've already lost

749
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
Yeah I think

750
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,624
I think that I brought this up in the show before but

751
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Twice

752
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
My grandparents

753
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Gave me a book

754
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
For Christmas

755
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,304
That was a tourist guide to heaven

756
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,400
It was outrageous thing

757
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
Zika think they had like

758
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
The question-and-answer like frequently asked questions

759
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:11,360
I'm like are the streets really made of gold

760
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Totally

761
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,528
That's not my heaven Dan I don't know why but to me it always seems a little bit like

762
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
A waste

763
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
The time

764
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Oh yeah 22 engage in like

765
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Trying to put

766
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Physical

767
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Details on

768
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Something good spirits I don't know

769
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
It seems silly and

770
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,960
Enjoy it existing on Alex's show it's really hard to shake

771
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,360
From a lot of people's minds the image of God as that old white guy with a beard you know and it's like

772
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,432
Really two are we there

773
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Streets are lined with gold

774
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
About why are you going

775
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
Is there an economy that was the point in heaven is their scarcity in heaven

776
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
Yeah that is going to be the angriest day of my life. Life is honestly I think streets lined with gold

777
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Would look tacky

778
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
I don't think it would be the best

779
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,288
Joyce Emily I don't think it would be the best choice

780
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
Adidas not a good metal to walk on

781
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:21,760
I don't think it is there would have to be people who were cleaning the gold streets all the video

782
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
Oh my God

783
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
Anyway Alex and Craig Roberts

784
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
Talk

785
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,840
Do you want to cover first and I think Craig Roberts is totally right okay

786
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
And

787
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
Or do you want

788
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
Need to hear

789
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
The after-death experience

790
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,888
Killearn that they do not

791
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
Everybody's like

792
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
Okay I did die it several times

793
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
Went to heaven saw doll but first

794
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
You really need to talk about troop mobilization as we go that like the logistics we need to get into the weeds

795
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Cuz people are listening

796
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Okay

797
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,600
People need to know that we've got to get two clicks

798
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
So I think

799
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
You know we're very interested in

800
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Knowing it's Alex

801
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,840
Thinks he's fighting the literal biblical devil

802
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
In 2003

803
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,216
And I can say I'm much more confident saying I think he thinks he is

804
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
But I can definitely tell you that Craig robbed

805
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
Thinks that there is the literal

806
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Workforce

807
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
To do will make you rich

808
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
I forget what happened

809
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
You know you're probably going to be

810
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Basically yeah

811
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
Minded before I do some

812
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
Regroup

813
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
Get out here and it doesn't matter

814
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
And they killed and they step on

815
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
The fascinating clip because I

816
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Did Craig Roberts sounds like he almost

817
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:11,231
Kind of understands the teaching them as a child that if you did anything wrong you go to hell

818
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
Abusive then Scare Tactics really does seem like he almost gets

819
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Can't make it all the way

820
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
The jump

821
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
There's a good chance that Greg is right

822
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,287
That is hellfire and brimstone upbringing did instill in him a bit of self-accountability and that

823
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
You may have

824
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Consider his actions more than he would have otherwise but

825
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,431
Because he was afraid of going to hell

826
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
If that led to him being a better person I suppose that's good but I would

827
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
Strongly dispute the position that

828
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,647
Fear of hell is the only way to create self-accountability

829
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
Teaching kids that they're going to hell if they don't behave well might be a way to convince kids to pay well but it's also a really good way

830
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Way to mess with their head

831
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,935
And give them enough baggage they may take years to unpack it all in therapy

832
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
And there's all kinds of detrimental effect has beaten as a child and I turned

833
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,871
Great t.i.

834
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
MMA pot

835
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
There's a

836
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,391
I certainly in my own life and the life of many other people I knew growing up in the church

837
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
This idea of

838
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
If you do bad you're going to hell

839
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,351
Is much more detrimental than it is helpful in terms of creating

840
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
Self-accountability

841
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,447
I did one of the big things that it does

842
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
Is it creates

843
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Intense

844
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Feelings of

845
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Shame and

846
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Guilt

847
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
Because

848
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Messing up is human

849
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
You're going to make mistakes

850
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,319
You're going to do things that are wrong and evitable Aid

851
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
And then if you've convinced yourself ahead of time that you're going to hell for it

852
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
All you're doing is guaranteeing that you'll have some kind of

853
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Intense guilt

854
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
But you'll need to

855
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
To deal with somehow

856
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
That you don't need to have

857
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
And

858
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
I don't know it just seems like a dumb

859
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Beer

860
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
It is one of those things where you know when you're in school we should spend more time on like understand

861
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Standing idioms in metaphor

862
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
And you said you like

863
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,807
Pull up your Treasures in Heaven you're like oh that's a metaphor that he's using it because

864
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,623
Material things are valueless and then other people are like

865
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
No

866
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
He means that if you do good in heaven you get a fuk

867
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Bucking bison

868
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
Yeah right

869
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
Equal system

870
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,631
It makes sense it wasn't that a brochure

871
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
About heaven that I got

872
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
I mean you're not

873
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
So when you do go to heaven you get a bike

874
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
And

875
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:39,455
You no longer have to worry about socialism nice

876
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Right now

877
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
And yes

878
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,551
We are judged on how we

879
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
And yes we need to plant

880
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Future Ferrari

881
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Prison camps

882
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Perfect North

883
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
Whatever

884
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Now's the Time

885
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Well my uncle

886
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
Therealak

887
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
Which brings up his uncle again

888
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
One of the guys I find really interesting is that

889
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,855
Ask Craig keeps talking about all of these

890
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,903
The experience

891
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
I only keeps going back to his uncle

892
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
That's just alike

893
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
Can we talk about my uncle like I know you haven't experienced

894
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
You're my guest

895
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,655
Yeah

896
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,775
It's almost like the radio version of somebody asking you a question because they only want to tell you the

897
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Their answer to that question or like

898
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,407
Would you play the million ducks are a million billion.

899
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,503
My God you're you thought about this and I have not had a thought

900
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
Well but also Alex

901
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
I think he thinks it's one-upping

902
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,183
You know like six times in the ambulance

903
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,815
And he can't make the story about him personally so it has to be about him

904
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,887
At the very least 81° situation

905
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,471
Uncle who died a bunch of times

906
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Amen

907
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
We get a revelation

908
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
That I have been waiting for for a

909
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:14,431
Very long time already knew but not heard Alex Jones

910
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
I actually layout

911
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
But yeah

912
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,063
Rebellious one my dad was the older son the

913
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Victorian

914
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,191
Finally Alex

915
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,007
The case for a very long time no your dad

916
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,847
The super into the John Birch Society John Birch Society

917
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,431
Beaches okay now we've gone from

918
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,831
My dad was around John guy who maybe had a few books

919
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Books on Earth

920
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
We had a lot of books

921
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
And it's like it wasn't that big of a

922
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
The f****** furniture from way back

923
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
2deck

924
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Games ago my dad was

925
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
The f******

926
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Monster High reviews

927
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,031
He was given speeches for the John Birch

928
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
Obviously deeply involved

929
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,943
By Alex tries to pretend that he wasn't because he knows

930
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
Coconut

931
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Point the

932
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
The label of Bircher is

933
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
More baggage than he wants

934
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,951
Soylent is uncle died about

935
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
Sometimes and then he went to a place

936
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
Where there are Crystal City is

937
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Grown

938
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
The waiting room

939
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
Went through toll

940
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Ena

941
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
Praying for him amazing

942
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Wow

943
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
Wow Crystal

944
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Cities

945
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
Getting scolded hey

946
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
If if I

947
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Have been doing

948
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,783
Boy Crystal series are what I think of

949
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Heaven

950
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
I love it

951
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,207
Wagon

952
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,303
So a story about is his uncle and now it's

953
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Craig Stern

954
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
To tell his

955
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Experience

956
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,679
And I got to say

957
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Too much

958
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Preamble

959
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,055
Ono Ono

960
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,127
He goes on and on about his tumor

961
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,455
And stuff I'm going to the hospital and then like

962
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
Hubris

963
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,807
The interesting part of the story it's the heaven

964
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,463
It's not the bleeder take for granted that you had a bad time and then you die

965
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,279
Cancer was bad

966
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
Yeah if it can't be like well I was in the hospital for a little while and then my wife came to me and we talked to the doctor

967
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:53,823
On and on and I think that even Alex is getting a little pissed

968
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
Nobody knows people who've Gone to Heaven Bryce what I want to know I think you can tell

969
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Come on man

970
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
Rooms on the gurney

971
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
I need a living will I think

972
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
Your hemorrhaging is hurdling

973
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
We don't have that

974
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
Financing

975
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
Make through the night before

976
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
Robert

977
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Buble

978
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:10,623
I think I was a little pissed that Craig threw it to break break

979
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
How

980
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,511
Dare you know that you can hear the music

981
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:22,143
Professional

982
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,007
Oh how about you go lead some more army people cuz I'm working right

983
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
Right now

984
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
We go back

985
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
From

986
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
And we get back and Craig's I can go back to Alex Jones's show I hears the host Alex

987
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
Every great he does not but we finally get

988
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
To hear about going to heaven

989
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
Amanda

990
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,143
For whatever they were going to do

991
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Play

992
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
I was

993
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,943
To another point

994
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Large

995
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
And

996
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
It was around this because

997
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
When you get there you just know

998
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
You know

999
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Receive or

1000
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
You have this ability

1001
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,823
I know what's going on around you

1002
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Music downloader

1003
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Cool

1004
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Feels great

1005
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Also there's a second

1006
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
I do like that to you I can either put the tube in my nose and instantaneously a Zoomer I was almost like I was on a drug

1007
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,863
Almost like they I mean they had me count backwards

1008
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
It's from 100

1009
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
And I remember making it to 95 and then God

1010
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
It was definitely God

1011
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,615
Had nothing to do with men Mannitol

1012
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,175
So Craig is alone

1013
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
And this big waiting room

1014
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
Thai place

1015
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
And they're too

1016
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
Two-door like in Beetlejuice

1017
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
Somebody standing right behind

1018
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,719
I don't feel like this is a bad boy

1019
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
The good place

1020
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,655
It's probably the size of a

1021
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
A medium-sized

1022
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
School auditorium

1023
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,263
Inside

1024
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Some type

1025
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Entryway

1026
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,975
With one that I would leave if I was taking off the office

1027
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
It's pretty standard I think you

1028
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
This kind of picture that you

1029
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,679
An image that a lot of people have

1030
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,751
Yeah you know what kind of like the architect in Renee Trick

1031
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:11,615
We talked about this before when I was working at a God camp everybody used to make each other pass out

1032
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
Cuz we couldn't do drugs

1033
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:19,039
A disorder stores a.m.

1034
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
What they would say is something like

1035
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:28,511
Oh I felt like I had lived in entire other life and I felt like my dream has been for 20 years long

1036
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,351
And all of that stuff and your Lego you were only out for 5 seconds or some

1037
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
Something like that and it's like

1038
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Yeah man the brain does that s***

1039
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
That's how it works

1040
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:42,335
That's what what are we doing are we doing with a waiting room why does heaven have a waiting room

1041
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
Yeah that does seem a little

1042
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,343
Seeing weird human thing a human thing

1043
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,671
God is like a listen we got overflow

1044
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,255
Can't handle it right now busy day

1045
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:06,143
Yeah I think I think the other thing too like I mean to you no dreams you can have

1046
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:10,495
Dreams that feel like they go on very long though in in

1047
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,567
Actual time that's not very like that

1048
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,871
On a very basic level thinking

1049
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
What about that

1050
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,687
Time experience

1051
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
That's not some divine

1052
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
And if you've ever had

1053
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:28,671
Sleep paralysis you still chemically shutdown in your brain works perfectly fine you feel like you're

1054
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,975
Hallucinating and going absolutely crazy

1055
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
So

1056
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,583
But when you're in heaven in the waiting room

1057
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
There's that there's someone behind

1058
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Charlotte School

1059
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,751
It's a good guess what your young again

1060
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,055
There are new

1061
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
Really matter

1062
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
Elena

1063
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
Family

1064
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
Everything that I was feeling

1065
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Young

1066
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:23,711
Now you understand heroin you just figured it out

1067
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Is that yes

1068
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,783
Yeah it is almost like

1069
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
You were

1070
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
Heavily burdened by

1071
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
Your physical body collapsing and then

1072
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,207
You were

1073
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,047
Experiencing relief from all that sort of

1074
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
Some sort of

1075
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,799
Really

1076
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,895
Notice that I was worried

1077
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,247
I didn't even look at my body

1078
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Right behind me

1079
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
What's going on

1080
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
I'm a burger

1081
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
Does he think that

1082
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
You know

1083
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
People like

1084
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
Indigenous people don't use the bathroom

1085
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,295
Nope no idea

1086
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,623
Nope there's no clue until you explain it to them

1087
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
They have no idea.

1088
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:42,303
It's a place where you do.

1089
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,863
It's like it's like what you do now but different

1090
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
So this being

1091
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,007
Who do you think this is God

1092
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Noah camp

1093
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,847
Niger hanging out behind you

1094
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
It's not God behind you

1095
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Knockout

1096
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,735
I'm going to go with

1097
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
Let's say green dragon

1098
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,463
Green Dragon green dragon I'm going to go Game of Thrones God is a huge Game of Thrones fan green dragon

1099
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
Missed the mark by a little

1100
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
I know

1101
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
Playmate

1102
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Backyard fence

1103
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,063
Vietnam

1104
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,975
The kid

1105
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Bear

1106
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,967
Like a picture with a celebrity

1107
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,991
It's okay I'm with you

1108
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,807
Anna I'll be with you

1109
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
That's it

1110
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Imaginary friend

1111
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
Broderick

1112
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
I do like

1113
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,743
The idea that Alex is there I hope

1114
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Gheenoe

1115
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:21,631
He had to have known that imaginary friends are real that have it right I mean he has to

1116
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,471
The presentation of like the pre-interview is when Alex

1117
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
And Craig Roberts

1118
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:31,871
Went down to Kansas City to do that babe radio

1119
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
Feel like it

1120
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
Probably could have come up

1121
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,503
Although I would also believe that Alex wasn't list

1122
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,831
Cuz you wanted to talk about how his uncle died about

1123
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
Alex

1124
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
You speak very good

1125
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,975
If he hadn't internalize this part of the story

1126
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
Yeah boy I can't imagine having somebody that I taken so seriously tell me that imaginary friend

1127
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Pens are real in heaven

1128
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
I was in the waiting room

1129
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
Behind me was

1130
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:02,847
1 ft tall version of my childhood

1131
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,407
Imaginary friends are real and having guys

1132
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,455
Waiting room Imaginary Friends

1133
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,807
Socialism is it there Heaven is capitalist

1134
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
But also you should know that

1135
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,159
Your childhood Imaginary Friends

1136
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Also your guardian angel

1137
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
Everybody I also knew by the way this is my guardian

1138
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Sky

1139
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Attorney lot of time so I could

1140
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
Everything you do in life

1141
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,919
Like this track

1142
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
A remembrance

1143
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
Everything

1144
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
Information everything

1145
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
How to make one point

1146
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Very clear

1147
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,839
If Alex is concerned about the surveillance state

1148
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,679
He should be really concerned about that

1149
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,287
If there are aliens or angels with

1150
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,151
What's the number to Lee record every good or bad

1151
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
I can't imagine with the NSA like I would even come close to comparing to that

1152
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
They have been secretly killing and Reviving people in a flatliner situation this entire time

1153
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,535
Call modern technology has taken from that waiting room

1154
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,839
According to Alex's own in

1155
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
Higher career

1156
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
What's being described is

1157
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,703
This darkest

1158
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,311
Culinary school

1159
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Oh boy

1160
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,175
Can I really want to go back to how many jobs

1161
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
That Craig Roberts

1162
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
This ad

1163
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,295
Where he has been in control of people living or dying

1164
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,599
Do you understand that that

1165
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:55,743
I don't like this I don't like this and it's like that kind of thing like if it if you have

1166
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
This belief system

1167
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,327
And that helps you get through the day

1168
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Find

1169
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:05,983
I don't want you with a gun I haven't done enough look

1170
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
Looking into

1171
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
Colonel Craig Roberts

1172
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
So

1173
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:14,687
I don't know what positions he's had or not

1174
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:22,367
I take everything with a little bit of a grain of salt super soldier as well

1175
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
I don't know I don't think he's ever been on Camelot

1176
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
But

1177
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
You know

1178
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,887
You tried the best friend who is imaginary is your guardian angel and they have a chip in them that recordes all the good things you do

1179
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
Religious

1180
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
So

1181
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,007
Actually answers a really

1182
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:44,383
Deep philosophical theological question and that is

1183
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
There's so many human

1184
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:52,063
How does God know all the good and bad things you do because at the end of your life you've got to be judge

1185
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:56,671
Whether or not you can go to heaven

1186
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Remember thinking

1187
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
When I heard that it was

1188
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:04,095
Does ineffable remember in the Bible we see through a glass Darkly

1189
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
Sure you know that Kai

1190
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,191
Ineffable impossible to f

1191
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,495
I do not say that

1192
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,311
Don't have that ass

1193
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,223
Some f****** computer chips literally affable

1194
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
Is a f****** snitch

1195
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
Okay in the end we got it

1196
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,495
Came before there's no way that

1197
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:03,487
Alex cannot abide by this

1198
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,559
Can or cannot do what's the point

1199
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,959
And we're arguing about whether or not your imaginary friend is a snitch or a witness

1200
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,567
This is if you replace God was Santa Claus it's the same conversation

1201
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,615
It's very similar

1202
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Outlook

1203
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,687
I being a little disrespectful

1204
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
And some people may think

1205
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
But that's not

1206
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Appropriate

1207
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
Sure

1208
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
I would like

1209
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
To present to you

1210
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
An argument

1211
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
I'm at is that

1212
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Alex

1213
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,767
Could not be more disrespectful to his own belief system

1214
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
And his own ideas

1215
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,119
Listen to this s*** when they come back from

1216
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Alright

1217
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
Back on

1218
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,967
Ladyandthetramp

1219
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:12,607
He interrupts the story of going to heaven to do a water filter add

1220
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:20,287
After bringing his water filter sponsor to talk about like this special that they have Man story of going

1221
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
Heaven is not

1222
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Finished by any stretch

1223
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
They went to break

1224
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,455
It was a cliffhanger of we're going to get back to your

1225
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
Experience in heaven

1226
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
Do we do not

1227
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,343
We get into a water filter commercial

1228
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
What are you going to do

1229
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,463
Whenever the app whenever your holy book very

1230
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Clearly states

1231
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,535
Except Marion Commerce and religion is

1232
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
Is a great idea

1233
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:46,399
Whenever the person you've named your belief system after

1234
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Has

1235
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,959
Explicitly said to you

1236
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,751
That rich people will make it to heaven

1237
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
Every time

1238
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
When you know it's a good idea

1239
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
This twist happened

1240
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
I literally

1241
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,199
How you say this

1242
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Sincerely

1243
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Had to stand up

1244
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,831
Walk around the room

1245
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,367
I put my hands on my hips

1246
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,719
I'm sort of breathing a little bit

1247
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:11,999
Can't do it

1248
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,559
I can't I can't make a joke out of

1249
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Like

1250
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,471
This is so disrespectful to the idea that you're having an interview with somebody about like

1251
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,775
You went to the afterlife

1252
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,591
And you're trying to present this as a real thing

1253
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,455
And what you do in the middle of it is slip in an interview with somebody else

1254
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,247
Who you're selling their ship

1255
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,783
As we all know

1256
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
Crazy Jesus

1257
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,879
Said buildup that I treasure in heaven

1258
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
And if

1259
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,183
You are in heaven

1260
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,535
The number one treasure you want to have is this water filter buddy

1261
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,167
Big Berkey Burke well you know there was that time that Jesus

1262
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
You know

1263
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,567
He went and volunteered at the money changing tables

1264
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,127
I would love to do this

1265
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,711
Money money guy

1266
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:10,367
I even told him there's a scratch scratch and dent sale on this water filters

1267
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,655
Panda

1268
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
Take advantage

1269
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,903
One of these was about a year ago

1270
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
Last time

1271
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:52,351
Weather filters

1272
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
Dial ticket

1273
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,087
Alberti products

01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,391
Okay well first of all with the

1275
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,743
Little bit more scratch

1276
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,583
If I were this guy

1277
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,887
I would probably be mad at Alex

1278
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Because

1279
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,959
I'm now being presented his own who's

1280
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,007
Interrupting the story of Heaven

1281
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
Scratch and dent

1282
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
Sale water filter just remember that this is your last chance to get these we're not going to run this sale again just

1283
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,879
Just like this life is your last chance for salvation in the next ladies and gentlemen we need you to get these water

1284
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Filters stored up in heaven

1285
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,207
It's like a it's

1286
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,511
Like a scavenger

1287
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
Like a parody of

1288
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
What Alex is doing

1289
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
It's insane

1290
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,471
It is insane it is I love it

1291
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
It's amazing

1292
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
It's just that that like

1293
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,711
If you see this this is almost another part of that weakest link in the chain of right-wing propaganda this is the way

1294
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:16,063
Weakest link in the chain of Christian propaganda of just like

1295
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,135
Once you see how glaring this s*** is

1296
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,463
There's no way you're not going to find smaller versions of that

1297
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
F******

1298
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,791
Everywhere it's just remarkable

1299
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,351
How old little care Alex take

1300
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
2

1301
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
Separate these kinds of

1302
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
Except his show

1303
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:39,103
Like I think there's a way that you could sell water filters and interview guy about going to heaven on the same show

1304
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,967
He's probably shouldn't do the ad in the middle of the story is going to have an unreal

1305
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
Unreal it's a little tacky

1306
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
We're careless

1307
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,927
This is twice we've achieved the story fro coming up

1308
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:00,863
We're teasing a heaven story through commercial but that's just a reality of

1309
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,007
Stories are very boring and we have gotten to some of the

1310
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,311
The details like

1311
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
From childhood was behind you

1312
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,967
Snitches on you're not going to be able to get over if you if that's part of your belief system

1313
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,063
Good luck to you then if I were Alex I might have gone to an ad to

1314
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:26,463
So a good boy when the guys lives

1315
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,815
Your imaginary friend is your guardian angel and he tells God all the bad and good things that you've done

1316
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,887
Maybe I would bail too but I have to go back

1317
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
Yeah that's

1318
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
The difference

1319
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
Phelps

1320
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
Tell you

1321
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,847
Tell Santa what is whether you've been bad or good

1322
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:47,199
Santa check his list here's where we break off because Alex

1323
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
Instead of being done with this

1324
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
I clearly

1325
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,087
Bizarre interview at this point

1326
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
I decide to go back

1327
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
After the water filter at

1328
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,695
Promoting

1329
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
Gun

1330
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,911
You use it everyday

1331
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
Recap

1332
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
Are you

1333
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,271
You are

1334
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
Angel

1335
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,207
So that's a set

1336
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,023
The table pretty well we're all caught up

1337
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
You're in heaven

1338
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,887
I would have preferred you said imaginary friend instead of guardian angel

1339
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
We got to keep this

1340
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,031
Respectable

1341
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,103
He got some info downloads

1342
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:54,015
Which is interesting about the NSA we've always talked about our modern technology

1343
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,807
Nobody is thought about death

1344
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,855
Sure Alex

1345
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
I was receiving information

1346
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,303
And this information

1347
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
Acknowledgement that I was there

1348
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
Take me on

1349
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Later

1350
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
Is it

1351
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
Isn't it

1352
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,823
Your house is going to the other end

1353
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,623
I don't know

1354
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,255
People that are running

1355
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Down the road

1356
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,495
What happened

1357
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,799
Very very interesting

1358
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
I felt like I hit

1359
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Gone

1360
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Maybe free

1361
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
There

1362
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Because

1363
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
And

1364
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
Call Alyssa

1365
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
Hours

1366
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
3 minutes

1367
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
Long-winded

1368
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,239
Wow so either he goes on to say that

1369
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
He was dead for like that 3 minutes later

1370
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,615
Interesting because

1371
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:33,503
Lead me to believe that there is a concept of time cuz he said within the human clock it was like 3 minutes

1372
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
There is a

1373
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
Yeah

1374
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,391
His own telling of it is like whether I guess time is still real

1375
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Yeah

1376
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,951
I don't I don't I don't know

1377
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,255
This info download thing is

1378
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
It's fascinating

1379
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,559
Tomato

1380
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
You know

1381
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
I think

1382
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:54,751
It's it's kind of Fairly obvious and I feel like more people telling me stories

1383
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
It seems like

1384
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:01,407
Heaven is limited by your imagination and not the other way around

1385
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,967
You know what I'm saying like

1386
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
It seems like

1387
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
Maybe your

1388
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
Creativity or lack thereof is the limits of how we're going to get into that as a related

1389
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
Info download thing

1390
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,231
In a second

1391
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
Where's we have one specific

1392
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,815
Check from the saddest vision

1393
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
Specifics

1394
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
I got one of them

1395
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,383
Chemotherapy after that

1396
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
Better

1397
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
It was all worth our time Coronavirus

1398
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Wow

1399
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,607
So don't listen to doctors

1400
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,423
Apparently is a good medical advice

1401
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
From the vision

1402
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
You know

1403
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
You were

1404
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
You were dead

1405
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
Before medical science

1406
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431
You want to stay that way

1407
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,759
Also you probably weren't actually most likely just dropped out

1408
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,087
Put into an induced coma and you are f******

1409
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
Confide

1410
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
At we get this

1411
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
This this message here

1412
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
I'll get a little bit more information about the message

1413
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
That he gets

1414
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
Get sent

1415
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
He got sent back

1416
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
I was sent back

1417
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
Information

1418
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,055
Years my research work

1419
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,847
Fire start I was gone

1420
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
You have to live right now you better live

1421
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Correctly because

1422
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,695
The New World Order

1423
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:00,191
Grounding

1424
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,287
There is a part of me that as I was listening to this

1425
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,591
I think Alex stole the store

1426
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:14,527
The info download the the beginning a message that you have to fight the evil

1427
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,671
Like II reminds me of stories that he tells now about getting Visions from God when he was at

1428
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,463
This time. Younger

1429
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,023
Yep nope definitely younger

1430
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
No you're right

1431
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,887
You think God giving him his mission and such like telling him

1432
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
Hit a big package

1433
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,447
Get downloaded it like

1434
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,471
Xenia

1435
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,287
Panoramic view of the world and everything

1436
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
Like I

1437
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,103
Would expect

1438
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
That if I were Alex

1439
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,199
And I were having this conversation with this guy

1440
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:49,599
It seems like Oye I would interject with my story very similar to yours if it is

1441
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,439
It is that similar and you're willing to discuss anything

1442
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Seems like that would be what you bring up

1443
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,583
I get a real very strong scent

1444
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
What's that maybe one of the reasons

1445
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
The Craig Roberts

1446
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,191
Isn't around his get Alex's

1447
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Take a note store

1448
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
That's

1449
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,567
Yeah the details of this

1450
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,895
Astoundingly similar to story

1451
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,943
Alex tells now about abs

1452
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,479
About himself Smith

1453
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
This one

1454
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Piece of

1455
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,903
Resistance to my own suspicions

1456
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,511
I'm at is based on like what maybe you just wouldn't want to talk about things publicly

1457
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,583
You know like maybe you would have some discretion about Llorona

1458
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
Experience

1459
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,703
But Alex does bring up how he has psychic dream there we go

1460
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,495
So it doesn't mean like

1461
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:45,407
A penny in for a pound of clean literally talk to I guess his imaginary

1462
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:52,063
Right and I believe this year that correctly or did his imaginary friends say to him

1463
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
The chemo

1464
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,111
I'll kill you

1465
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
No no no

1466
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
Get all that stuff is going to kill you

1467
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Get off at

1468
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
And all healed

1469
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:06,143
Oh okay I heard it as like a man

1470
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,567
Interesting Guardian Angel that's not the way I heard it I don't think that's what I said but

1471
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,384
Yeah they sometimes the ears hear what they wanted

1472
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
When you have

1473
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,736
A guy who's presenting himself as having a like this

1474
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,784
Divinely originating

1475
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,112
Packet download of information that was super in Port

1476
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,696
And Alex on the present-day says that this happened to him at the beginning of his career

1477
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,488
You think that he would

1478
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,584
Commiserate about this if Alex is willing to talk about anything

1479
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
And he is willing to talk about stuff

1480
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Like I said

1481
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,424
Either profit

1482
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Pinstripes

1483
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
Once every two years

1484
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,880
911

1485
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,928
How do I get on the air

1486
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,280
Intuit

1487
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
New York

1488
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,912
And I have the information but

1489
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,264
Where I saw

1490
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,288
The tower

1491
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,944
So I think that all the 9/11 truthers and the we are change folks and I everybody was like Alex.

1492
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Gerald is always right

1493
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,504
You know what year

1494
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,552
What you're really reinforcing is his

1495
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:32,928
Yeah he's a he's if you say Alex is right

1496
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,976
Then you are taking on

1497
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
That he is a psychic

1498
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Who can see the future

1499
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,984
Not someone who is understanding the future you're not defending somebody who's done a lot of research

1500
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,592
And knows things and understand

1501
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
Like

1502
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,736
Still stand behind things like loose change

1503
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,064
Disproving it totally cuz know this isn't based on

1504
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,600
Any kind of

1505
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
Actual report this is a

1506
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Based on Bible

1507
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,464
We've that 9/11 was an inside job

1508
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,744
It's not based on

1509
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
Proofer

1510
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
No dents

1511
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,632
It's based on the fact that I had a prophetic dream ahead of time

1512
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,168
I knew this

1513
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Well I mean

1514
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
It look

1515
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:21,312
Doc Brown didn't worry too much about all those facts and stuff

1516
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:26,432
He had a dream when he hit his head in the bathroom and the flux capacitor came to be

1517
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:30,272
Interesting differentiate this

1518
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
Dark brown is real

1519
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,672
At the fake store say you're going to tell me King Arthur is real

1520
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,280
Absolute Madman

1521
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,888
John degrandpre son of Uther Pendragon

1522
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
Has come to Legend

1523
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
That is true

1524
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,336
I find this all very dicey and sketchy

1525
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Alex should

1526
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,712
2 because he wants some specific information about taking formation

1527
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
Is that the great God

1528
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,040
Well if it's from God I would want

1529
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,856
Pacific Steel yeah but unfortunately that's not the way this

1530
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
More knowledge

1531
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,008
Was that

1532
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Information

1533
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
Music

1534
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Kill Trump

1535
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,632
Oh that's super convenient that really is super convenient convenient

1536
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:53,984
Love that because now you don't have to give any specific information to people

1537
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,288
Could judge whether it's accurate or not or

1538
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
Anything you can

1539
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,104
Just give yourself

1540
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
Built-in

1541
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
Credibility whenever you tell anybody anything

1542
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,992
This particular thing I am telling you

1543
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Is from God

1544
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:11,392
Now I didn't know this like 20 minutes ago but it was in that filing cabinet that God gave me

1545
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:14,464
And I can't confirm this order

1546
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
I didn't know it before.

1547
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,352
No but you have to listen to me baby

1548
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,680
The courts and now is the time for me to tell it to

1549
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,472
This is almost like

1550
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
Scam artist

1551
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,616
Body armor

1552
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,664
Yeah yeah

1553
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,712
You know it's been the same

1554
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,736
F****** Playbook

1555
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
4

1556
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,600
200 years

1557
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
This

1558
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,232
Exact conception of the information that I don't have access to until I need it

1559
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,864
That's what Steve Quayle says also about this like Vision that he has

1560
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,400
The two of them both have

1561
01:24:54,912 --> 01:25:00,544
Exact same explanation for why they don't have information the court until they need it

1562
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,616
Divinely-inspired

1563
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
And you know why

1564
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,432
Cuz cop out there fun

1565
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,224
Yes

1566
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,296
This is a really Ironclad way

1567
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,344
To never have to

1568
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,136
Show you're at space

1569
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
No and that's why I mean

1570
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,304
You know I imagine that the very first reason that we invented a divine anyting

1571
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,888
Was just because somebody got ask a question that they really didn't want to answer

1572
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,544
The equivalent of

1573
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,104
You don't have to do voices when you Channel

1574
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,432
Explanation built into the store

1575
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Yep it's

1576
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,784
I find it I find it suspicious

1577
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,600
You can't be preemptively defensive

1578
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,392
About why you don't know

1579
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,208
You know like if your preemptively defensive that

1580
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,512
It suggests to me that you already know you're wrong

1581
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:59,936
So I think that you can have interviews like this are not disrespect

1582
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
To the person you're interviewing

1583
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
Like I think

1584
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Sharing a

1585
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
Experiences of

1586
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,128
Likes things

1587
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,408
You have

1588
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,200
Subjective experience of

1589
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Discuss those things at end and not

1590
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,856
Necessarily pass them off as

1591
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
This is the truth of the universe Shore

1592
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,488
The same time not be like you're dumb cuz you think

1593
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,024
You went to a waiting room

1594
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,816
I think there's a way that you can

1595
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,120
Recognize the subjectivity of it

1596
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:33,984
Recognize what it means to the person you're talking to you without

1597
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,264
Universalizing

1598
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,848
Right right right Alex does not do that

1599
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
Sounds about right

1600
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
Is Buena verse Eliza

1601
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:54,720
When do a coma for weight

1602
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,352
Happened to him

1603
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,264
It really does happen

1604
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,872
The problem is

1605
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,576
4 people singing for 2 seconds

1606
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,792
Yeah this is

1607
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:33,632
This is him saying this is all real this is all like this is all truth

1608
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,752
Everybody knows it that's why I said devil

1609
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,800
Created scientist

1610
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,360
Explain to you that

1611
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,408
Drugs do things to your brain

1612
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,432
Yep yep

1613
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
So when Alex said

1614
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,784
I think now is the time to talk about some of my experiences

1615
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:54,368
I thought well obviously he's going to get into

1616
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
How he also had an information download

1617
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,256
He doesn't talk about a prophetic dream

1618
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,728
Call Herbert

1619
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,592
And at one of those dreams

1620
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,576
Don't you

1621
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,880
New York

1622
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,424
I learned this when I was young

1623
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
That you're a psychic

1624
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Do you have prophetic to

1625
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
There is

1626
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,896
The other side

1627
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
And I have been

1628
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
Seen it

1629
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,528
There's there's an interesting

1630
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
Sing

1631
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,088
I just

1632
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
I can't accept

1633
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,672
Somebody who is

1634
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,952
Is like I

1635
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
Make reporting based on profit

1636
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,096
That I had I have dreams and this is going to

1637
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,888
Affect my coverage of the new

1638
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:10,912
Right

1639
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,936
I can't accept that

1640
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:18,336
Living simultaneously in the same space as someone who like everything I talked about it documented

1641
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,480
You can't both have because here's what happens if you both have all the evidence

1642
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,040
And you have a prophetic dream okay

1643
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,320
Okay

1644
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,624
So maybe you were dreaming about the

1645
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
Or

1646
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
Why did you need the evidence

1647
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,256
You had the prophetic dream

1648
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Or

1649
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,352
Who cares about either one of them

1650
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,632
I think that

1651
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,984
I think it's an inability or unwillingness to choose a lane

1652
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,288
I think it's because Alex realizes that like

1653
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,824
I don't actually have prophetic dreams

1654
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,640
If I tried to do that I'd be wrong on a lot

1655
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,248
So I better Edge everything with fake evidence to

1656
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,576
If you're hedging then I don't believe you

1657
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
I mean

1658
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,904
In this kind of circumstance

1659
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,720
This is an all-or-nothing situation

1660
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:12,096
You've either been to heaven or not so you've either proven that heaven is real or not

1661
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,144
There's no other way around

1662
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
I don't

1663
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,472
I think it's appropriate for like a magician

1664
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
Let's say

1665
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
To do magic

1666
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,080
Insist their magic

1667
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,664
Right I've been also explained how they

1668
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
There is the problem

1669
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,528
I could handle that kind of an act

1670
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,112
So we're getting closer to Alex

1671
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
Being

1672
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Against the literal.

1673
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,208
Well I mean he's already said that

1674
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,256
That's how the enemy

1675
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,328
That's why the enemy has all those quack

1676
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,400
It's right so that has to be the end

1677
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,680
I do feel like

1678
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,240
I am very close to being able to say

1679
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,544
But Alex does believe he's fighting the devil

1680
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
In 2000

1681
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
Experience

1682
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,040
Connected to that

1683
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,064
Let that world

1684
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
Okay

1685
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,952
When your dad your dad

1686
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
There is a spiritual war

1687
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:18,912
A war going on all around us right now we may not be able to see the spiritual or

1688
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,984
And your imaginary friend

1689
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,800
Doing right here

1690
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,896
Against

1691
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,528
Nobody

1692
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
Gary Ridgway

1693
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,024
This is not the world we lived

1694
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:53,984
Right now in heaven

1695
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,064
So

1696
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,928
Robertson saying that Satan's globalist socialist

1697
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:19,328
Crowd some people just won't listen some people

1698
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:22,656
Sand

1699
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
Physical War

1700
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,240
Well the physical Warriors

1701
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:30,592
Information was why would that be the war if it's the war for heaven

1702
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,920
Exactly

1703
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,528
I think that the way that Alex is responding to this

1704
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,320
Leeds 12

1705
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,600
Suspect that he believes

1706
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
It's not him

1707
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,512
Explicitly laying out that I'm fighting The Devil Ride

1708
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
But it's

1709
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,560
Nuages closer

1710
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,120
It's swimming in the same pond

1711
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,400
And being like

1712
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,704
I like this Bond I'm on days where I

1713
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:59,776
Feel comfortable was the only the only thing

1714
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
Do is

1715
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,640
That I mean yeah the only question then is

1716
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,664
If you

1717
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,968
Received message specifically from God

1718
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
Then

1719
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,272
The then

1720
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,832
Does your Christianity include

1721
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
The devil

1722
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,160
Cuz if it does

1723
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
Then

1724
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:19,232
You believe you're fighting a literal devil

1725
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:24,352
The only way he's not fighting the literal devil is if he doesn't believe that the devil is real

1726
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
Yeah

1727
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
So

1728
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,800
He's fighting the literal Christian do I think so I think his entire career has been predicated on

1729
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,104
Trying to trick people into think

1730
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,200
Making his political beliefs in reality he's fighting

1731
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
He's just

1732
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,600
I think so you know what if that's the case

1733
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,720
You've done a pretty good job of obscuring

1734
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,536
Yeah yeah he really has people do not

1735
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
Think of him as nothing more than a televangelist

1736
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,912
I think I think that he's made himself so weird and

1737
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
Interesting

1738
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
On other levels

1739
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
Pullo's

1740
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,336
Byzantine Mazes of bigotry

1741
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:11,456
You kind of don't don't think of him primarily as somebody who

1742
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,992
Is preoccupied with fighting

1743
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,808
The literal devil

1744
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:21,696
Pretty fair to say I'm still going to keep looking around to 2003 watershed

1745
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,720
Yeah this

1746
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,256
This it convinces me

1747
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,584
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt I declare

1748
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
Guilty of fighting the literal Christian devil

1749
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:35,520
I think I tentatively agree with your your verdict

1750
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,312
But I still want

1751
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,848
I still want more information

1752
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:43,712
No I want to say I'm fighting the devil

1753
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,992
And also like

1754
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,392
Going back to 2003 and finding episodes like this it's like there's gold in them thar Hills again

1755
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,608
Yep this is the problem with what you believe

1756
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,400
Nobody wants it to be real

1757
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:08,800
You can't go about making it real getting Trump elected and all that chicken whole world

1758
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
Just learn your f****** lesson

1759
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,920
Quit beer and it's Alex

1760
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,968
Complaining about two TV shows

1761
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
Selling

1762
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Witchcraft

1763
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,088
And then I think Craig Roberts

1764
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Might be

1765
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,392
Not cool people be

1766
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,008
The New World Order

1767
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,664
Colonel Robert

1768
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,760
Then that were seen

1769
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,576
It's okay if you're almost

1770
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
We're getting into

1771
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,496
Working art

1772
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,480
Wild wild

1773
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,808
Just got to get that Hitler in there sooner or later

1774
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,880
And maybe education took over the

1775
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:30,720
Yeah that's the problem is a problem

1776
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,768
Probably the thing that he hates most yeah

1777
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,328
This episode was so

1778
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
While

1779
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,680
To listen to It's So enjoyable on a number of levels

1780
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,240
Compared to a specialist present

1781
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,544
Do you have

1782
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
A guy who went to heaven

1783
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,616
And I was trying to interview him

1784
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:50,688
Am trying to have some semblance of like

1785
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
This isn't a ridiculous interview

1786
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,320
Meanwhile the guy is talking about his

1787
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:01,440
The imaginary friend from childhood being there behind him in the waiting room without him

1788
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,744
And then Alex Goes to off

1789
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:07,072
F****** interview with this water filter sponsor it's just

1790
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,888
Onion of parody

1791
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,680
That that him

1792
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:17,312
Having the gall to be like you know like those fake Christians those 501 c 3 Christian right is like

1793
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,128
Are you just mad because they don't pay taxes

1794
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,176
Because you're doing the same s*** man

1795
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,992
You went to a f****** water filter

1796
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:31,392
Interview in the middle of a story about heaven Christian

1797
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:37,792
With their money all of these Christians obsessed

1798
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,632
It's a great price at MSRP but this

1799
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
Is 140

1800
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,424
Yeah

1801
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
So I think we have

1802
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:50,080
More reason to believe that Alex thinks he's fighting very literal devil and has forever

1803
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
We will dig deeper and

1804
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:54,688
And find whatever we can find a 2003 cuz it's

1805
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,784
Indeed we will

1806
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,624
We have a website its knowledge buy.com

1807
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:09,792
We are also on Twitter is that now just were fighting at go to bed Jordan at Imaginary Friends guardian angel

1808
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
You're my guardian angel dad

1809
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:18,240
And when we get to have it I'll find out you've been imaginary the whole would be weird

1810
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:22,848

But Garfield without Garfield knowledge fight without

1812

Randomly laughing at my own f****** jokes

Yeah that be brutal

1814
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,416
Gastodon a show and

1815
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,488
We had to record our end of the audio to send to them

1816
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
And I've gone

1817
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:46,912
Listen to the whole thing or anything but I will check your ex or the audio sounds okay and it is bizarre

1818
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:51,520
You're just one into the conversation imagining your audio isolated

1819
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:57,920
God that was when we were when I was attending the D&D show together I was I was isolated

1820
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
Everybody's individual tracks

1821
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,480
And you

1822
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:04,320
Could just pick out weird sections whereby just wanted to clip that

1823
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,600
Without context

1824
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:09,440
Beautiful everybody sounds insane everybody sounds nuts

1825
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:14,816
Indeed we will until then neon Leon dzx Clark

I'm Daryl rundus

1827
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,888
And now here comes

The sex robot

1829
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,472
Holding
