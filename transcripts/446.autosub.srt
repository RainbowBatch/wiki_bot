4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Just a little bit

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,912
Question

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Here's my bright spot I am madly in love with

8
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,432
I mean it's too early to say overcommitted but I really I really like

9
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
His place

10
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Smooth

11
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
I think everybody out there who was sent to the

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
Of a smooth painless transition

13
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
That's not my bright spot

14
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
Got something in this apartment that I have been

15
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:46,752
Unknowingly looking for for my whole life that is a signifier of adulthood

16
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
A junk drawer

17
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,920
I never had to text Gerard

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,064
I have

19
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,464
Aluminum foil or plastic wrap

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
We're talkin about a screwdriver

21
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
Aluminum foil

22
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
The extra one for once I run out of this one

23
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,640
Phones that are completely dead

24
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
A couple of rocks

25
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
From back when I had a juul

26
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,072
There's always a playing card somewhere

27
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,424
To actually have a dedicated Place stuff in a box

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Cintas

29
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
I didn't realize how much

30
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
It would be gratifying

31
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,872
Just have a drawer

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Associate with being an adult like it's something that every grown-up house has like

33
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Mike

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Clutter and everything but they absolutely had a junk drawer in pretty much every house I didn't realize that

35
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
It's great I now feel

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,816

I was going to have

39
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,736
I got to ride the train and I haven't heard the train in such a long time

40
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
So I could walk to a little further partner

41
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,912
Every single day

42
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,032
Experienced the wobble wobble

43
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Yeah I hate it when I first moved here

44
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,224
Derail every time I wrote it took like 4 years for me

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,856
Yeah part of that was that when I first moved here all of my jobs were downtown

46
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,440
I lived in Lakeview

47
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,071
There's an express bus that runs on Lakeshore Drive from Lakeview to downtown

48
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,167
It takes like 5 minutes to get the never had to take

49
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Take that to work

00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Going to shows

And on the way back

57
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
Somebody was very very drunkenly threw up on another guy

58
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311

This really is a disturbing pattern

77
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,015
It seems to happen more than I would like I'm comfortable with

194
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Flavor

195
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
I think it's a good player

196
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
But I do enjoy like

197
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
A sparkling white grape or something like that

198
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
It doesn't have the pills in it whenever incorrect

199
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Okay whatever

200
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,831
Difference

201
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,671
Ivo Everlong history

202
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Not good

203
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Poorly executed

204
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
All right my apologies to bike race

205
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Condolences

206
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,471
Jordan we're going to start our observation investigation

207
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm here actually on June 11th

208
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Okay because

209
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Implications

210
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
For the 12th

211
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
From somebody by the

212
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,807
The end of this year I am burning this new apartment

213
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,159
Because we're not

214
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Not this house

215
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Anyway

216
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
There's no context

217
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
Yes I did just leg drop Alex Jones from the top of the news

218
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Guy

219
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Okay

220
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
That gives you some idea where we're going

221
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,151
It's not it's not nothing though

222
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
A big enough

223
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
All right ladies and gentlemen

224
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
What you see here in front of me

225
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Is

226
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
The super

227
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Alpha male

228
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Championship belt

229
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
The super alpha male

230
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,655
The Infowars super ultimate championship belt that I now present here on the deck

231
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
So is a WWE belt

232
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Something important

233
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
So that no one has for the alpha male champions

234
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
It's actually a Dairy Queen crown

235
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
Using is not a generic wrestling championship

236
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
It is a wrap

237
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
WWE belt

238
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Pacific Bell

239
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,535
Vocal in their displeasure with some of the WWE

240
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Particularly after the

241
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
The brand split

242
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
WWE started running two shows weekly a separate product with supper

243
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Roster

244
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
Each show Raw and SmackDown have their own championship belts

245
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Which follow Brandon

246
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Freak Show

247
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
The belt on Raw generally red

248
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
Blue

249
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
The fifth marketing

250
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
The belt Owen has on his desk

251
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
It's from Smackdown

252
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,111
But it's also one of the Tag Team Championship

253
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,487
The design of the men so about belonging to the universal champion

254
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
From tag team strap

255
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
So this makes less sense than it already did

256
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
There should be a second

257
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
For some reason

258
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,335
Because I really thought we were going to find out that Owen had chosen a specifically racist

259
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
Wrestling belt of subsoil

260
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
History goes all the way back

261
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
To the beginnings of segregated WWE wrestling

262
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
That's what I was expecting

263
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
A little bit of a drop

264
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Are we going to find out this is a racist

265
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
Current Smackdown Tag Team Champions are the new day

266
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,727
One of the most important groups in WWE

267
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
Beginning of the day they started horribly conceived

268
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Gospel Choir

269
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Theme team

270
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Xavier Woods

271
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Kofi

272
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,063
Eventually took the gimmick into their own hands they really got creative what they're doing

273
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
The currently one

274
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,951
The few groups in the WWE who actually seem to be having a great time together with

275
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Nick's organic is now in

276
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Possible to really explain

277
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,887
But involves unicorns torso thrusting Xavier Woods playing a trombone cause playing

278
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,007
Cakes of people and having their own cereal called booty-o's

279
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,895
Okay honey clearly have quite a large amount of control over the things they do like

280
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Xavier Woods

281
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,783
Named his Tramp II trombone Francesca character

282
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,647
They hold the record for the longest Reign history of WWE

283
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Steam traps and are Sure Shot

284
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
For the Hall of Fame

285
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,583
Kofi Kingston born in Ghana is the first african-born wrestler to ever be World Champ

286
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Winning about Monsanto

287
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Classic match at WrestleMania 35

288
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
In the lead-up

289
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
What's the match

290
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,055
Xavier had to win a gauntlet match in order to get Kofi into the championship fight

291
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
And despite some clunkiness

292
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
It was actually have each other's back

293
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
I want to see each other

294
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Succeed

295
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,295
Where is so many other WWE tag teams are just

296
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
Preamble 41 member turns on the other to setup a hotspot

297
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
The new day has been

298
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Pretty adamant that they are never going to

299
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
The Break-Up

300
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Biggie put it this way

301
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
I'm not saying the Kobe doesn't get a world Title reign without the new day but you don't get that same with that same

302
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Moment of Brotherhood

303
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,287
That same story of two guys who've been able to go through the gauntlet to get their brother his title match

304
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383
Able to do the last couple of years that is unique and special

305
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
You don't get any of those Momin

306
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,271
We listen to people that say actually you should turn heel

307
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
It's my time I should really make this time about me

308
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
That's not something that even remotely

309
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
In 2018 Xavier Woods said quote

310
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
I don't remember a group in wrestling that hasn't

311
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
Turned on itself group again

312
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
Newday I'm telling you is right now do they will never turn

313
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
Ever and that's because we have zero desire to ever do that

314
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
Zero desire to go to work and not work with my

315
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
My friends

316
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
He went on to say quote we will all retire before we turn

317
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
That's a legitimate answer

318
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
That's not some thing that because it's happening

319
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
Know my government name is Austin Watson

320
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
Austin wanted to tell you that this is a truce

321
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
They love each other

322
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Theralogix

323
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Espresso creativity the branches into like

324
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
Some of their nerdier interest like

325
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,311
Xavier Woods a super into video games that he started the show called up up down down

326
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
We're human other wrestlers play video

327
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
The game competition

328
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,247
Spiraled into like massive popularity

329
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
Grape and enjoying every moment

330
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Wonderful

331
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,607
Great day is a really great story three friends doing something great together in a shity

332
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
Pretty full of horribly sexist and racist

333
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Does tendencies

334
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,775
If I had to guess I would bet that Owen has no idea he's using as a prop

335
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
What it is

336
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,895
Or how the individual competition

337
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Or even who the rightful owners

338
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
It's just interesting to me how it's the worst possible belt

339
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
The chosen to using is there in

340
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
That's where I thought we were going

341
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
So I think about this a little bit

342
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,423
AJ Styles is currently the Intercontinental Champion and that dude is probably

343
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
Okay

344
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Show in the title

345
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
AJ Styles

346
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Debunk stocks

347
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Masculinity

348
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Spell are you sure

349
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
Sure wasn't

350
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
I don't know use the universal championship

351
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
Monster among men

352
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Stroman

353
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,999
Seems like a really likeable guy for a while but

354
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,839
She took to the internet to s*** on out-of-work wrestlers who are having trouble paying their bills.

355
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
Because most wrestling events were canceled

356
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
After the Coronavirus

357
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Caesars

358
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
Yeah those are both individual

359
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,543
It's held by due to probably think Alex might be onto something

360
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
The only downside is that the universal champion on the Intercontinental Champion her way too close to one world champion

361
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,015
Battery for what

362
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
This is stupid just because it's a tagged

363
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
So so disrespectful

364
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
Who Alex almost certainly thinks our heels because they're not

365
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Yeah that would be the

366
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
The only explanation there

367
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
Bizarre to me the layers of

368
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Maybe think it's a

369
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
Accidental circum

370
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Suck up there

371
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
Course it's going to have some sort of

372
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Connotation that he's not even aware of

373
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,407
Nothing they do nothing they touch

374
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Does not wither

375
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
With racism

376
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
This was a horrible racist

377
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
I'm sure that

378
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,512
But I would strongly suspect

379
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
And they just got whatever about

380
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Of course it is any of the other one

381
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,312
Cliff Owen talks about what the plan is here

382
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Here's what's going to happen

383
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Tomorrow

384
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
In the final segment

385
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
And I'm putting everyone here on blast I was going to be nice and I wasn't going to death now I wanted to razz me a little bit so

386
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
So here's the deal

387
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Tomorrow

388
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
The first

389
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Ever

390
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
Infowars super alpha male

391
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Champion

392
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Brought to you by super male Vitality in Alpha power

393
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Infowarsstore.com

394
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,008
The first ever super Alpha Mill Champion will be crowned tomorrow

395
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
In the last segment

396
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
And we're going to be having a push-up competition

397
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
And I was going to be nice to everybody

398
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
But you wanted to harass me so I'll go ahead and say it

399
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
I'm going to kick all your ass

400
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
I don't know how they got that sponsorship

401
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Appeal

402
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,440
Superman

403
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Some really really picky with what

404
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Easy just greenlit the show

405
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,632
Celebrities

406
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
They would sell

407
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Unbelievable

408
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Jesus

409
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
When is trying to cut a promo about

410
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Cuz they're trying to ape

411
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,432
The WWE wrestling

412
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,808
Striped cut promo

413
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
All the sudden doing this on her show

414
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
Contest whoever wins gets MSNBC for another

415
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
I don't know how

416
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
In other news the Kremlin owns MSNBC

417
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Shirtless on a horse he can do a s*** ton

418
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
So here Owens cutting a promo

419
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Way too long response

420
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,272
I'll be surprised if anybody here in this building can even do half the push-ups I can do

421
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
We've had some people float Darren mcbreen's name around

422
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
He's old he's washed up

423
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
Some people said maybe Rob back there can do it

424
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Too much hair

425
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Heavyweight him down

426
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
The Charisma this guy

427
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,472
There's some lady's back here that all day

428
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Now

429
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
No

430
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,128
No folks do so there you go so here is what will be my belt

431
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
In 24 hours

432
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
This is a

433
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
Tragic approximation of a guy trying to cut a wrestling promo

434
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Not good

435
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
You just think that he's better at push-ups than the people in the office

436
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
And an unnamed woman in the office there light

437
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
But they can't stop him

438
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
The thing is that there is nothing here to sink your teeth

439
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
There's no passion behind this nor is there any

440
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Switch Archy

441
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Wrestling promos to work

442
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,848
Greatest Promos in WWE history was from King of the Ring 1996

443
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
A stone-cold

444
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Steve Austin just defeated Jake

445
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
The snake

446
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
To win the King of the Ring

447
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Tournament

448
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Let's listen to the

449
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
This promo and then I'm going to lay out the way

450
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,368
This program is successful and OMG

451
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm at the back door

452
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Studio

453
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
The first thing I want

454
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,936
Crap out of my ring

455
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,104
Don't you

456
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Bruce Sun

457
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,504
You ain't got what it takes anymore

458
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,856
Bible

459
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
And you say your prayers

460
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,304
Talk about your songs talk about John 3:6

461
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,168
Austin 3:16 Says I Just whooped your ass

462
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
Fieldstone called

463
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
Bottle of Thunderbird

464
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm serving notice

465
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
Everyone of that WWE

466
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Superstars

467
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
I don't give a damn what they are

468
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Girl on the list

469
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,816
Start running

470
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Alright Stone Cold Steve Austin

471
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Anna's remarks

472
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
96 WWE

473
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
I don't give a damn if it's Davey Boy Smith

474
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Call Shawn Michael

475
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
Steve Austin's time has come

476
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
And when I get those shots are looking at the next WWE

477
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,880
Headmaster bottom-line

478
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Music apps

479
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,536
At the beginning

480
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Because he

481
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
You know you saying he's washed ashore

482
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
That's kind of a better version of Owen just saying

483
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Because Stone Cold added layers

484
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
Same to impart meaning

485
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:29,760
Jake The Snake was a really religious character says don't to create is Austin 3:16 catchphrase

486
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,904
Jake was a recovering alcoholic so we brought up the idea of a bottle of Thunderbird giving him back his confidence that he lost

487
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,768
These are ways of saying that your opponent is old and washed up without saying something so boring is just

488
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
You're old

489
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
That makes the promo compelling

490
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Because Stone Cold

491
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Take a picture with words instead of just saying

492
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,800
A thrashing has fallen upon its don't beat up later

493
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
This is how you do it when your goal is to pump yourself up against a nonspecific

494
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Opponent

495
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,224
Uncle doesn't know who he's fighting

496
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Next

497
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
This isn't

498
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,832
This isn't anything other than just self-aggrandizing

499
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
I'm better than everyone

500
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Kind of thing

501
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,512
Davey Boy Smith he's old John Michaels Hair weighs too much

502
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,608
Wasted time on boring insults choosing instead to make passing reference

503
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
Focus on the best

504
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
And his time

505
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Has come

506
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
That would have been great if Stone Cold

507
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
A lot of people think

508
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,784
About 8 the truth tri-light

509
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Batter

510
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,440
Wrestling promos you really only want to talk about

511
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Things get a little bit

512
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,536
Computer grandmother supposed to supplement existing

513
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Storyline

514
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
The King of the Ring tournament and go was getting a title shot

515
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:56,800
Not so it makes sense for him to just beat and let everyone know that

516
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
What moving forward

517
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,968
The flipside of this kind of bra best exemplified by

518
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
The hard time

519
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Promo delivered by Dusty Rhodes back in 1985

520
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,440
At the time Dusty and just returned from an injury he suffered at the hands of Ric Flair

521
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
He was finally getting a chance for Payback

522
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,328
Specifically targeted at Ric Flair

523
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Let's listen to the

524
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:29,312
I would like to thank the many many faster at this country

525
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:34,176
Bedroom 20 the American dream while I was down

526
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,784
I want to take Jim Crockett promotions

527
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
Call waiting to take it at a because I know how important was

528
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,720
Any positives to the reservoir that is the Democratic promotion

529
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
Conductor of the American dream

530
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
What deadweight

531
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
Got what I wanted

532
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,448
What are the World Heavyweight Champion

533
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
I don't have to pay a lot more

534
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,080
About the way I feel about Ric Flair

535
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
No respect

536
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Moana

537
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
But if you want to do Mondays in the first place

538
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Time do Dusty Rhodes and his family

539
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
What does

540
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
I want to text I'm working around this contract

541
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Waterworks

542
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Bottle water bottle

543
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
Summertime dogs and hard times

544
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
But when I'm mad as working a job

545
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
What are you

546
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Spider-Man watch

547
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
And say hey

548
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Took your place.

549
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,344
OurTime

550
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
U-Pull-It

551
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
And we all had hard times together

552
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
I don't look like that Selena today

553
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
Little big

554
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
Little big

555
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
But brother

556
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,152
I am better they know I bet

557
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
Pendawa to bad people

558
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
When will John Wayne he's dead brother

559
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
Ridge Apartments

560
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Right now

561
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
I won't do it all good no

562
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Marlin

563
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
All over the world now

564
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Because

565
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
The love

566
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,968
I will repay you now

567
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
I will be

568
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
World

569
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Heavyweight champion

570
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Enterprise

571
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
Major Von

572
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Let me leave you with this

573
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
One way

574
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Tell her.

575
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
McFly

576
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Just take what he charges more than anything in the world

577
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
That's the world heavyweight title

578
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
I'm going to take it I've been there twice

579
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
This time when I take

580
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Make a daddy

581
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
I'm going to take it

582
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
For you

583
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Los Gatos

584
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Don't let me down now

585
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Cuz I came back

586
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
For you

587
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
So that man up there that

588
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
The dad

589
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
12 years ago and never got the opportunity

590
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Castillo real wolf camp

591
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm proud of you if they got a head

592
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
And I love you

593
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Amazing

594
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
Amazing Obama's 2004

595
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,096
Recognized

596
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
Third grade

597
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,008
Union organized exactly

598
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,200
Everyone knows that Alex is going to be arguing over this stupid belt

599
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,088
So it makes sense that I just cut a promo on Alex Clare

600
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
No one thinks or the payoff it is going to be like

601
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Gary is going to get her ass kicked

602
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,560
I have bad news about the payoff

603
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,192
But anyway

604
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,728
Steak about the Dusty Rhodes

605
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Ric Flair fight

606
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
It's not just about who is Champ

607
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,640
It's about Ric Flair injuring Dusty and Dusty coming back because he loves the fan

608
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
He connects with the audience

609
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
It makes if you were feeling

610
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Invested in him winning

611
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,344
You bring pesos to the feud by comparing his being injured and unable to work

612
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Do the everyday person out there who got laid off or work 30 years and got to watch

613
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
He's making himself someone that the audience

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
Can project their own feelings onto and relate to

615
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
You want to Route 414.

616
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
And watch him beat up Ric Flair because he's elevated this into being

617
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,520
Himself being a stand-in for you or someone you know fighting

618
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,128
Cool faceless business as represented by Ric Flair

619
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
That's a very simple thing

620
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Masterfully executed

621
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Within a matter of a couple minutes

622
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
You have just like every like

623
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
Amazing Stories

624
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
Compare that to what

625
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
He just said you can do a lot of push-ups

626
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
So what

627
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
Are tons of examples of wrestlers are dukaki

628
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Gimmicks

629
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Another thing is that they're cocky

630
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Usually the villain

631
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,472
Play up the annoying characteristics of a cock

632
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,568
So you as if you were really want to see the guy who don't like

633
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Beating up

634
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,920
So obsessed with his body

635
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
Ted DiBiase always brag about being a millionaire

636
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
These were things that they played up

637
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
To make it more satisfying to see them get their comeuppance

638
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
In terms of being a cocky heel

639
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Even failing

640
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,536
Another thing that Dusty does amazingly well is that he never says that Ric Flair sucks

641
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,912
This is so important and good wrestling promos because if your whole argument is that your opponent sucks

642
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
You've ruined the fight

643
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,776
If you're saying your opponent sucks and then you win so what

644
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
You beat someone who sucks

645
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
If you lose then you just lost someone who sucks

646
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
It's not a good way to build towards a fight

647
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
And good practitioners are able to put the

648
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,296
Cells over and simultaneously put over there

649
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,392
They're like hey you know what you're you're really good but I'm better that kind of

650
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,720
Is essential

651
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,536
Because Owen fails to even do this he's basic

652
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Setting up a boring as hell

653
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
All departments are trash

654
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,960
So why do this yeah I'm going to do twice as many push-ups

655
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,776
The other people in my office

656
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Is a lame thing to do

657
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Even if you're not on

658
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
A radio show

659
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
Pretty lame yeah if you're just in regular office and you were like

660
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,672
You suck radio show that's in million times worse

661
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
It's clearly a situation where they're like let's do a play on wrestling ocean

662
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Didn't think

663
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
Through any of the ways we could make it

664
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
Good well you have to think it through

665
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
It's it's shockingly embarrassing

666
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
And they don't

667
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,824
Bright

668
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,688
Maybe even you.

669
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,296
Because this is the wrestling that I like the most

670
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
The storytelling aspect of it

671
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
Good wrestlers Dallas

672
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
The people often don't understand at all

673
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,864
People just think the wrestling is people fake punching each other than occasional yelling into microphone

674
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
And that's pretty unfair

675
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
Also I'm making a big point about this because it's

676
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Clearly a plan B

677
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
They have a replica belt just for the Segway

678
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
Owen is announcing that a champ is going to be crowned a day in advance

679
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,040
Infowars has every opportunity to prepare and actually try to do something decent here and this is what they come up with

680
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,136
They're trying to ape the style of an art form they don't understand and have no respect

681
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:17,536
And just comes off really embarrassing

682
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
I can listen to that clip of him challenging

683
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
People in his office

684
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Do a push-up contest

685
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
NSYNC

686
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
This guy

687
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Has it

688
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,032
I don't know what it is it's

689
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
That's not good

690
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
It's not good

691
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
There's a recognition or some kind of a feeling that a lot of people and Alex's might be wrestling fan

692
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
But if they are

693
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,576
I don't think they would enjoy that

694
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,648
Owen lazily insulting people that he's going to have a push-up

695
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
We got this prop

696
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Good enough

697
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
Done nothing is worse than a

698
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
Corporate entity

699
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
Do you like taking over and just

700
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
Not pleasure of patronize

701
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
Such a disrespectful

702
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
If you like wrestler

703
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Here you'll like this s***

704
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,176
Right right

705
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,736
Approximation of slop on your f******

706
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Snap stock

707
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,952
So intense this announcement

708
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,816
Not to belabor the point but what someone with a bad back

709
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Contest

710
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
It's it's

711
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,472
Nonsense less of an alpha male

712
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
Because you quit is debunking

713
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,080
Masculinity

714
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Kentucky sucks

715
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,968
Email anymore

716
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
Consult AJ Styles on this

717
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,112
Comes down to

718
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Bream versus Owen Shroyer

719
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Right

720
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,216
Where do we get we don't get anywhere good

721
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,056
This was Darren mcbreen's flute

722
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
This is his Michael Jordan it's like

723
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
It comes from behind Adeno

724
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Michael Jordan

725
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
He is not

726
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,720
Just keep saying like just like I want you

727
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,024
Which is uninspired and boring but at least

728
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
It's not destructive to the

729
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Concept of the competition

730
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
To build towards

731
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:34,496
12 episode of the War Room opens up with a t-shirt

732
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,336
I know it's been super into props lately

733
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
You get the skull chess set

734
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,504
Rose thing

735
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
Comes off as a little desperate

736
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
Everybody loves

737
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Props

738
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
That's why the most famous comics in the world

739
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Comics

740
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
True

741
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Oh yeah

742
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Really f***** up was that

743
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,144
The big logo that's on the screen behind Atlanta

744
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
Says

745
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
War of War Room Raw

746
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:12,896
No definitely get them the owners of the WWE

747
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Grecia

748
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,528
The small business administration president

749
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Bravo

750
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
And I think

751
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
As I understand the WWE

752
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,256
Text to Sue people here's my biggest issue

753
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
With this whole thing

754
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Alright do you realize

755
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
How infuriatingly close to a palindrome

756
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
War Room raw is

757
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,776
Yeah it is really close

758
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:45,408
Infuriating to me how they could do that that fux with my brain like now that I know that it's

759
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
Almost 2 lb rub it makes me so angry

760
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Yeah

761
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
Bino bra and War

762
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
It is not clickable

763
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
It's not for real easy War

764
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
Difficult for me to handle

765
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Call Soto

766
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Sure

767
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,896
Well I'm going show

768
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,456
Interesting enough to robot or discuss on our show

769
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
What's a quorum it's a show that's almost done

770
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
Exist

771
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
It's boring

772
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,648
Just covering the same

773
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,024
He doesn't pretend he's a psychic or throwing any of the other insane bulshit that Alex does to make the show interested

774
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
I don't care about anything going covers on the show but I do cut up this one clip

775
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
From when he was 2

776
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Taking calls

777
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
22nd

778
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Alright well met

779
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Make yourself

780
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
A directive

781
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Advance directive

782
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
And out

783
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Acetate

784
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Medical decisions for them

785
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
Be legally allowed

786
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Hospital

787
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
All right so they're go folks little inside there

788
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Also a taser

789
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Maybe some brass knuckles

790
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
Maybe some lead as well

791
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,936
I've heard that I don't know I'm not saying that works I'm not sure

792
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,496
That was shocking even to me

793
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:20,640
Yeah that was a mess

794
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
With a taser

795
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Brass knuckles

796
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
Playfully suggesting that listeners should basically you have a lace

797
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
That would normally be a pretty dumb thing but in the

798
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
The climate we rented a business

799
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Credibly Danger

800
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,304
We talk better than recent episode

801
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Uptick in people trying to attack Hospital

802
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:45,984
Whether it's because of the added impact would give their political message or because they believe the virus is a hoax

803
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Hemet Hospital's are in on it

804
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
Anybody who'd play into this the way Owen is doing right there is

805
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,640
Trying to get more attacks

806
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:58,783
There's no other excuse for that kind of comment other than your audience to hurt Medical

807
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,927
I've been spending a lot of time on the wrestling aspect of the show but it's important to remember that Owen is a huge piece

808
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Piece of s*** and it shows just a

809
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Is Extreme an awful is Alex's

810
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
That's still stick

811
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
With a push-up

812
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,239
And how poorly set up it was conceived for the X

813
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Executor

814
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
It's important to recognize that like that

815
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Although it is at all so

816
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Yeah that's

817
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
To remember

818
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
The juxtaposition of them is so

819
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
F****** insane having a stupid push-up

820
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,631
Propaganda

821
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:52,287
Like it is just all man look at this guy's other there oh and by the way it's a good idea to continue

822
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Gaming with juice

823
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,639
Alright next mode Lex KY up to the thing

824
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,599
Baby. Very popular.

825
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
Owen tries to get through his show and get

826
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,047
Maybe about like an hour in 10 into the show edits

827
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
Push-up contest is not really broke

828
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
And he's just wearing a stupid shirt

829
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
Atlanta t-shirt

830
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,079
Could you wear a tank top no

831
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
From listeners who are stupid

832
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
And

833
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
You know what's going to happen

834
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,087
Mainstream media is dividing America by Design

835
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
110 percent

836
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Yes sir

837
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,743
I thought you were in a lot of pain from a tooth extraction

838
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Youth

839
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
I'm going to win that belt Alex

840
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Nobody here can do as many pushups

841
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Because

842
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
Well first off I'm already so

843
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
Just because you're young where is the rat

844
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
What the song mean

845
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
I want to be the one where is the RAF

846
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Alex is probably

847
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,463
Drunk Santa

848
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
About

849
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Can't put it on

850
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,543
You can't figure out how to put the belt on

851
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
And he's like

852
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
Trying to latch the buttons on the back

853
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,039
Eva Eva

854
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,975
Stupid voice

855
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,839
Owen doesn't even stand up

856
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Plywood

857
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Time Warner. You

858
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Do you have

859
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
Active do the most pushups

860
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,567
This is by Fiat you're like Joe Biden dumb you're trying to steal a bell

861
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
Bald man

862
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
You're trying to steal your trying to steal

863
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
You're trying to steal about right now

864
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
You're like a Democrat

865
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,807
You want to mail in Maryland championship

866
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,167
So the guy who sang disallowed internal put on a red shirt

867
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Are you coming

868
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Structure to the bed

869
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Trying to attack the ref

870
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,711
Puts his hands on the rest

871
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Explodes backwards

872
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
And falls over

873
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,111
It's just an embarrassing silly poorly-executed pratfall

874
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,951
This is like all that stuff and there's no actual fighting it's just

875
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,511
Overdramatic

876
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,655
I got to say right off the bat this bit is not going well

877
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,519
So far it sounds like a bunch of assholes out of YouTube clip that nobody should have watched

878
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
In the first place

879
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,175
Deserves about

880
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
How long is the championship belt Preserve

881
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Is going on here

882
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,951
Blackmail Championship out as being abscond at right now

883
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:27,071
Alex Jones is absconding with the belt he's now running out of the studio

884
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
He's now absconding with

885
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,215
The super alpha male championship belt folks this whole thing is now is now

886
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,007
Open stolen by the Democrats

887
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,639
So just like everything else they just they just steal everything vote

888
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
You're here and you might as well be a Democrat right now

889
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,039
So In that clip

890
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Miss Alex

891
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
It's about being chased by the rest

892
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,047
Continue through the offices route to the loading dock

893
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
Any can't resist yelling mail in ballot

894
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
Haven't broken the seelie besides

895
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Back to Ocean

896
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
That's quick about

897
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,543
Reaper seeds to try to put the belt on his head

898
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Like it's a crown

899
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
Booty has trouble because it's about

900
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Okay

901
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
This is a disaster

902
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
This is like an elementary school

903
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
Informative play that they do to teach you about the

904
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
The dangers of smoking and how ml do a nice little fun skit about it'll be a whole sketch and even a three-year-old

905
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
Even that third-graders like this is f****** lame dude that a lot when I was in junior high

906
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,751
Victoria Elementary School

907
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
New York

908
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
Depressed

909
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
And

910
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
Spirit guide

911
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Feel like it would work

912
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
I was Winnie the Pooh

913
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
About that

914
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
Tigger

915
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
But

916
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Yeah I could like it was one of those weird

917
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
I was in junior high

918
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
I thought like

919
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
Acting with a path I was going to go to her

920
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Everybody

921
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,055
Even at that point looking back I can't remember like

922
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
The kids were not in

923
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
What we were doing

924
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,711
I could tell that we were

925
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,807
About Winnie the Pooh

926
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
The junior high

927
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Write this is a skit

928
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,535
Mostly being improvised by a bunch of

929
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Yeah yeah

930
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,959
Play plan

931
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,079
Denny's bumrah showing show any wants to play with the phone

932
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,687
Yeah so Alex like I said he's trying to put this belt on his head

933
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,551
Are you struggling with that

934
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,183
Philly syndicated radio show

935
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
National radio host

936
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
To heads of state

937
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
Secret Service

938
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
About

939
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
I don't think it would even fit around your head Alex

940
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
I don't think it's going to fit

941
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
You got to go get your Corona count

942
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Time for that

943
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Oh

944
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
It does double as a Corona mask

945
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
There it is

946
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
And it also

947
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
Can be used as a weapon

948
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
With that that heart rate

949
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
No but you're not a minority

950
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
Are you thinking even play that card

951
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,079
Balding fat dessert

952
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,895
Maybe at the office but in America you're in the majority

953
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Or what

954
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
You guys are great

955
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,343
Yeah the Hallmark of any great comedy

956
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
Is Adnan racism

957
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,999
Completely unrelated

958
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,071
Great

959
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:16,447
You have this situation where his head

960
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
It's not work

961
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,567
Loses track of it and it's his face

962
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,127
Answer the written about being a Coronavirus

963
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
It's very sad

964
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
Nothing's working it's a low energy

965
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
It's like Alex is trying to

966
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,111
To bring some chaos into visit make it interesting but it's just

967
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,927
Is it a two-man improv seating

968
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
Okay hi welcome to this bus I'm the bus driver how are you today

969
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,191
Operating tables

970
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
So what you're describing is

971
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Is good

972
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Greater bro

973
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
The buttons to work

974
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Any desire

975
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,175
Redeem about racist

976
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Oh yeah

977
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Know your

978
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
No you're in the majority now

979
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,183
Well they're probably made in China

980
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Actually I don't know

981
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
Can you put together for me

982
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Let me see this year

983
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Get on your knees right now

984
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,239
Get on your knees and then Crown you

985
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
Trying to see where the thing was made

986
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
I'm not playing Sonia

987
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
It is going to feel nice though

988
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
When I'm legitimately

989
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
Decided

990
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,791
I tried to look it up and I know that

991
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
The toy belts one

992
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
For kids by Mattel I don't know about the adult

993
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Like the normal size

994
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,015
Owen is looking at the inside of about and I know that there is

995
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,831
A little tag inside there a little late

996
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,415
And if you'd seen made in China

997
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,911
Curiosity being Center of all their f****** racism

998
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,751
Would you assume the answer to your question is directly in front of

999
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,567
Or ask yourself a question

1000
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,623
It's unwise for you to speculate

1001
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
Because there's only two possible outcomes

1002
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
You're right

1003
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:53,631
You have revealed that you assume anything you don't like

1004
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
It's that it's just not

1005
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
From a standpoint

1006
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
It's not a winning strategy

1007
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,359
Now what you want to do is get snot.

1008
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,967
If you can right right make sure you put yourself in a tunnel and back yourself into a corner

1009
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,295
And that will lead you to where Infowars it which is a very six

1010
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,855
So

1011
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:19,487
I still can't get this on and

1012
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
You turn it into a face mask

1013
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,079
Mommy

1014
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
Yeah I could see that

1015
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,199
See you aren't you have turned into a Democrat I don't know what happened to you

1016
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,319
Democrat

1017
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
What is that

1018
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Video

1019
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Did you

1020
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
What

1021
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
No chops are

1022
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,535
Bull boy

1023
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
Because he does there that I

1024
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,887
Is dancing like a Democrat

1025
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Very similar to the signature dance

1026
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
The Big E

1027
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,263
Of course

1028
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,407
So you know it's only a lonely dance move

1029
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,015
That's totally but it also could imply

1030
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
And he doesn't want

1031
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
Is kind of

1032
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
A bland

1033
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,143
Generic dance but it is also what biggie does Riley make a big deal out of it

1034
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
Like like other wrestlers will like join in the dance with them

1035
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
The tide of the trademark of the new day

1036
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:44,735
Well Owen respond suggests that he is not seeing Alex dance in any fashion

1037
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
About the new day

1038
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,415
It's like a Democrat what does that even mean

1039
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
I don't know

1040
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
What do you like that was

1041
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,679
An insult

1042
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Meaning nothing

1043
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,263
Isn't there some sort of

1044
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
I think more than that

1045
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,527
I think you could dance in anyway

1046
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,623
Just wants to make fun of

1047
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
2B I want him to

1048
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:29,279
Pin down on this I want specific moves that are Democrat or Republican

1049
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,167
The floss is Republican a s*** I'll tell you that right now

1050
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Listen to this

1051
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Did you

1052
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
What

1053
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,079
Did you drink some of the fluoride

1054
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,383
Did you watch CNN

1055
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Be honest do you watch

1056
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
CNN

1057
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
And now you're you kind of

1058
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Be like Don Lemon

1059
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,575
Lemon for a while

1060
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,671
You like Trevor Noah to you moved on from Don Lemon to Trevor Noah

1061
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
Are you still upset

1062
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
The Don Lemon dumped you

1063
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
That's not how it works

1064
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
No no put the belt on him

1065
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
Alex deserves this belt

1066
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,311
Terrarium

1067
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,383
We should be playing on a loop in a terrarium

1068
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Thousands of years in the future

1069
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Used to be like

1070
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
Look at what prehistoric man was

1071
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
It does feel very much like it's shocking

1072
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
This is an 2020

1073
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
This is

1074
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:34,047
This is Chrome magnetic

1075
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
It's funny cuz it's a disaster

1076
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,423
Second I can't imagine anyone watching this and being like

1077
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,751
I trust these guys to read

1078
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,591
Buy information

1079
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
Improv

1080
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
Yeah you know people like to cut loose

1081
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
This is such a

1082
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
This is a telling

1083
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Oh man

1084
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,063
These guys

1085
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,903
Feels like he's entitled to no one will help him

1086
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
With the straps

1087
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
Jones too drunk for buttons

1088
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,447
Deserves all this stuff and then

1089
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,287
It starts to get into the zone

1090
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,847
You need to go to the autonomous Zone where everything's done

1091
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,895
M4u this is America

1092
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,943
That little you go to the park

1093
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
This is not

1094
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
Chaz

1095
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
That is this is not Chad

1096
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,695
That only happens that magic only happy for jazz

1097
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,535
Porta-Potty right here

1098
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
There's our Porta-Potty from Chaz

1099
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Hold on guys

1100
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,447
But get the shot that Alex is using the Porta-Potty from Chaz

1101
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
You don't want to know what just happened

1102
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,479
So at this point the recipe years and gives Alex a bag to serve as a porta potty

1103
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,807
Alex places that on the ground in front of Owens desk

1104
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,879
Please remember this is a family show

1105
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:11,839
I have no idea why but there's a weird statue that looks like a Roman Centurion sitting on the floor in front of them

1106
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:16,703
Alex

1107
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,495
It just looks like you shiting on this statue

1108
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,287
It's very not that funny

1109
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,271
They pulled it out it's unintentional

1110
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
This is Opera

1111
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
So many high school parties

1112
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:43,583
Still in high school and having a good time and then there's the drunk guy who's lost his f******

1113
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,679
Can't handle his liquor anything like that and everybody's kind of look at it as like

1114
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983
To just get this guy out of here

1115
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,383
But there is three around always egging him on

1116
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,919
Keep doing this

1117
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,991
And you hate the party and anyways I f***

1118
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
I hate Todd

1119
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,575
You know what it's like a this is also Friday

1120
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
Is last Friday

1121
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:12,767
Does kind of like an office where people

1122
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
And like

1123
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,007
Start drinking in half an hour once my show's over already

1124
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
That's the vibe

1125
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
Who cares

1126
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,527
I was just painted by shooting on a bag gym bag

1127
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,087
Pretty grave so now Alex leaves

1128
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
You didn't know that

1129
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Cisgender

1130
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
You want to go

1131
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,143
You want to cancel Paw Patrol to

1132
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Unbelievable

1133
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
You would

1134
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
You want to cancel

1135
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
Paw Patrol

1136
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
You want to cancel everything

1137
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
I'm not

1138
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
We'll have to find out

1139
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
I guess he's not

1140
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,551
Wow Alex isn't leaving

1141
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:14,719
In this several minutes ago

1142
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:19,071
Go home clip Alex said

1143
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,143
Start another conversation about how many push-ups Owen

1144
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
2nd phone call with my

1145
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Keep going

1146
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,079
Alex

1147
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
Skip the talking about how are you

1148
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
But there's a catch

1149
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,967
Why you want some food

1150
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,063
You are a social justice Warrior

1151
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
No I'm saving up my energy

1152
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,951
That would be

1153
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Yeah

1154
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,095
I'm not sure that's regulation

1155
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
I'm not sure that's regulation

1156
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
11:00

1157
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,711
Let me see anyone more

1158
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
I don't really care but Alex is doing.

1159
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:23,071
He's only going about halfway down formation

1160
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:29,215
He basically looks like a guy who doesn't do push-ups regularly trying to act like a tough boy while drunk at a party

1161
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,287
Exactly what's going on

1162
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,823
What's going on with that exactly

1163
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,687
You know I hang out with

1164
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,527
When we get together

1165
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:47,391
Can we start riffin we have a good time we laugh out loud we express Joy with each other

1166
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,927
Something along the lines

1167
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
These guys don't seem to express Joy just like

1168
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Energy

1169
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
Play just have

1170
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Energy

1171
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
It's coming out but it's

1172
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,215
Kind of manners

1173
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:06,079
Yeah

1174
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
It doesn't feel like they're having fun

1175
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:13,247
No actually

1176
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:19,135
Can if you just stop being so racist and saying everything is a social

1177
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,975
Justice Warriors

1178
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Presentation

1179
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Hemorrhoids

1180
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
Lawn mower

1181
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,055
Answer this no 10,000 10,000

1182
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
We are get into that

1183
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
I know you spell

1184
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,151
Justice Warriors don't like rules

1185
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
But I'll tell you what they found

1186
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
You got to do one more there

1187
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
Just one more

1188
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Tell me there's a whoopee cushion

1189
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
10000

1190
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:09,311
So the first thing to note is that Alex is definitely

1191
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,199
Constant talk about exercising every morning

1192
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,991
And what have you

1193
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
Weird noise you hear there at the end is Owen jumping off his desk and doing a little leg drop onto Alex Wiley

1194
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
He was doing his last push up

1195
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,767
It's not like a regular leg dropped Owen lands with his back

1196
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,607
Kind of in a straddle position

1197
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,679
How many gets up and he drops an elbow

1198
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,239
It's probably fine but honestly this is

1199
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
Kind of dangerous

1200
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,567
Is not in good shape

1201
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
And no matter what is a couple

1202
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:49,503
The unprepared Alex is facing the ground in a push-up position

1203
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,807
Wrestlers trying for a long time

1204
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,111
And work really hard to do things safely they

1205
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
If you try to run

1206
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
Recreate will really hurt some

1207
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,231
Some basic wrestling moves of John for real

1208
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Straight up Killa purse

1209
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
Like a DDT that's a normal move

1210
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
The Finisher most

1211
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,471
The time you gave someone a DVD onto a hard surface you could very easily knock them out

1212
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Give the brain.

1213
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,591
Driver could easily kill a person or break their neck

1214
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,199
Even professionals have a hard time with that one was mostly band but WWE

1215
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:24,063
After Owen Hart box wanted SummerSlam 1997 Stone Cold Steve Austin

1216
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,855
Yearly paralyzing

1217
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:30,719
Horseplay is fun but when you're jumping off you know stuff onto the back of it

1218
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,815
Clearly exhausted 46 year-old who just had oral surgery

1219
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
You're not playing safe

1220
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:41,727
Man this may not have let any real issues with the decision-making that leads you to do that kind of thing as

1221
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
An adult

1222
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Is very suspicious

1223
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Three suspects

1224
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
So Alex has been

1225
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Out since

1226
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Yeah

1227
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,527
Did Owen kill Alex

1228
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,183
No I don't think so

1229
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
Something cuz that would be pretty great

1230
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Hitler was Hitler killed

1231
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
Couldn't be that

1232
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,447
Like if Owen took down Alex Jones's

1233
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
Leg drop

1234
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:21,919
I'll be pretty funny

1235
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,271
National thing or

1236
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,111
Through maybe Family Court

1237
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,415
There are

1238
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:38,303
You're not doing well in life if they are so many possible reasons that you can delete all the stuff

1239
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:42,143
Probably Owens like Drop

1240
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,703
So are the elbow

1241
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
This is Xavier

1242
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Alex

1243
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,783
Police in this country how you like that

1244
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
My God

1245
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
What are we doing

1246
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,439
Alex Jones dad

1247
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,511
That guy just break in there

1248
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,791
Is war room is raw for nothing

1249
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,583
So that makes no sense

1250
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,655
Why is Owen saying this is what we do the police in this country

1251
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
Is Owens gimmick supposed to be that easy

1252
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,007
The parody of his own fears of the last

1253
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
Is if so

1254
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,943
Or is Alex's gimmick supposed to be that he's a

1255
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
The cop

1256
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
Because that hasn't been established at all

1257
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,087
However to help make sense of Alex, just taken

1258
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
About

1259
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:37,695
It could be a civil asset forfeiture angle sure how much fun would that be

1260
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
I need this to be more interesting but really it

1261
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
It's just Owen being shity at the

1262
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
Bestop off-the-cuff

1263
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,911
Confusing as hell

1264
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
Hitting

1265
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,983
Alex Jones with a belt in your own Troy

1266
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
It's it's imagine

1267
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
To work being done

1268
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
It's

1269
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,943
Like those

1270
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
Like you learned the worst

1271
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:05,599
Lessons of humor from Family Guy where it's like if you just make a reference to a different thing that's

1272
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,671
Kind of humor

1273
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,583
Visual

1274
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,167
So after this point

1275
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
Written off TV

1276
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
Any leaves

1277
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Congratulation

1278
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
Answer calls

1279
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
The truth

1280
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,943
This works for a little while

1281
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
Doesn't doesn't really work

1282
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Divide weather

1283
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Are you got to be

1284
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,951
Either division is Love Now division is inclusion now

1285
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
You didn't know

1286
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
I did not

1287
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
I didn't know you were

1288
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
Clarifies

1289
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,591
Bird facts

1290
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:03,967
Is Lumber back into the studio and

1291
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,759
What's about

1292
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,095
Oh I should also say Alex is carrying a big guy cup and he's clearly just it to the Superbowl

1293
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
That's a real judge

1294
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
Is gray radio

1295
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,903
You're all off the air

1296
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
Money's mine

1297
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
You are very tired

1298
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,143
Walmart payment now

1299
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:04,639
He is breathing super heavy it's gross

1300
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,431
You so gay

1301
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,855
He has no cardio he just did a little fake attack on on

1302
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
Oh my God

1303
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
It's scary

1304
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:23,583
It makes me wonder how he's able to yell for like 5 minutes straight without

1305
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
That is

1306
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,287
Jesus taking over the show

1307
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:38,431
Nothing better than just a weird old man grunting together and then

1308
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:42,015
BJ Thomas's to steal buddy

1309
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
Dismount

1310
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
This resolves itself

1311
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
Satisfying

1312
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
Conclusion

1313
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Sinbad

1314
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
I will say I will

1315
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191
Standing over somebody

1316
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
Is not bad

1317
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
And Alex

1318
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,439
Explains why

1319
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
Apologize

1320
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
He's got a gas house ready but I did

1321
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
This is Owatonna

1322
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Madonna

1323
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,031
Choreographer millionaire attachment

1324
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
The matter comes up within the hour

1325
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Of course

1326
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,415
What's happening now is gone backstage input on a Doctor's lab coat

1327
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Choking out

1328
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,255
Spencer's

1329
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
This is real

1330
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,655
Rihanna

1331
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:08,543
We got a truck out of water

1332
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,063
We got a whiny now

1333
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,391
Who are you people

1334
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,439
We got a white meat

1335
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
We took a yd out

1336
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
Reverse your privilege

1337
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Get out of here

1338
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,431
So he is now walking Alex

1339
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
To the back

1340
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,807
Alex is the highest quality programming ever

1341
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,367
Do off camera being shuffled out the door

1342
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
Disney

1343
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,159
King Boo

1344
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,983
All right well this is not

1345
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
This is a family show

1346
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
The family show

1347
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
I was wounded by Alex Jones you saw it

1348
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,087
I was assaulted right in this chair

1349
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
What is happy

1350
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Security

1351
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
Also it's the second time in like a month that Owen is pretended to murder Alex by strangulation

1352
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:58,367
Vision board

1353
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,911
Selling Alex's attack

1354
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,727
He's remembered that in this established reality there

1355
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,543
Pretending to be in a situation where he should be

1356
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,639
I was just attacked him with the belt and beat him up so when he shows back up

1357
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,455
It makes no sense if he doesn't have some kind of an injury

1358
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
Small hat tip

1359
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,039
2014 understanding that element of Storytelling

1360
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
Alright

1361
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,855
Unfortunately that's Mall hats it doesn't

1362
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,903
Anywhere near big enough for the

1363
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
Did you receive

1364
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,463
For everything else in that segment so

1365
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:40,863
Nikki came back with the doctor's coat nose like he was a different characters when he shows back up as himself used

1366
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Oh Alex

1367
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,007
Beat me up a lot of wrestlers even

1368
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
Forget Xterra

1369
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055
It's so

1370
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,335
It's so obvious

1371
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
Like

1372
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
These people have never even talked

1373
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
2

1374
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,783
Human what are you talk

1375
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
We got a Whitey

1376
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
Like they're a mess

1377
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,023
Imagination they have is just their own like

1378
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
It's stupidity

1379
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
Creative

1380
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Save

1381
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
Like that

1382
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,959
That's what they think the

1383
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,495
And it is

1384
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
It's so weird

1385
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:27,199
Never had fun so I think one really pretty clearly drunk

1386
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,783
Slurring and I get really worried

1387
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
Want to hear him say that the reason he hasn't left

1388
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,111
Just cuz you can't find you forgot it

1389
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,559
Is because someone hit them and called him a cab

1390
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,911
That is really f***** up like the idea that he's driving

1391
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,727
No he was drinking his I can't find my keys

1392
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:55,615
That one they have in Katy

1393
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,407
That's all he does that every

1394
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,455
Positive

1395
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,503
You better hope he is

1396
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,319
Because that's normal

1397
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,367
Implies something

1398
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,671
Is not solved by striated

1399
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
The rights getting too good

1400
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,375
They are really good

1401
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,959
That's what I that's what I take away from this is

1402
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,031
Why aren't there more conservative comics

1403
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
It's because we're censoring

1404
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Totally

1405
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
So

1406
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,455
I thought that this was the payoff

1407
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
Who is an actual

1408
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:45,535
Get the f*** out of here overproduce with like fake audience cheering and then

1409
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,375
Fake firework after the announcement of the winner of obviously Owen

1410
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,447
It's really a disaster

1411
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,775
This is another thing where they suck up what wrestling is

1412
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,359
Alex and him doing this is the main event

1413
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
That's the main event

1414
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,527
Don't even do the push-up contests

1415
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
Yeah

1416
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:13,183
Darren mcbreen Rob do Marcos Morales and

1417
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
You have peace

1418
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:21,631
This is like giving away paper view match

1419
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
And then

1420
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
I don't know doing nothing on the Pay-Per-View

1421
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,495
Bad business

1422
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
It's not good no

1423
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,335
This is

1424
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,431
To approximate what wrestling is

1425
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
Complete

1426
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:39,295
Lack of understanding lack of Interest like awareness like a preparation

1427
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,367
Look better in an hour

1428
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
Probably

1429
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,511
Okay here's a coherent reason why this is happening

1430
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
So it's not just

1431
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,815
Stupid chaos

1432
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:55,679
You're going to bring in the belts and announced the day before you're having some kind of a contest

1433
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:58,495
Did Crown a champion you clearly raise at least

1434
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,311
Partially invested of doing this as a bit

1435
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
Bucking how bad I resent it

1436
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
I resent it very much

1437
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
Just come up with

1438
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Any idea

1439
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,015
Any idea that would be better than

1440
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,319
Especially the idea of not doing

1441
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:23,071
Probably the fact that they're Infowars means they don't have access to anybody who could write something better

1442
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,119
Decided dick around and pretend it's comedy

1443
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Thank you

1444
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Yeah that's true

1445
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
So you got home safe

1446
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,055
Curious and interested in

1447
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:39,711
Comes from doesn't come from just being like

1448
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
Oh yeah I saw that s*** lips

1449
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,695
Steve Martin if you're really good at, you will end up using everything you've ever learned

1450
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
As part of your act

1451
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
Yes exam

1452
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:55,071
Paraphrase what is something like that

1453
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:00,703
Play to the top of your intelligence

1454
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,263
We're watching whatever you're doing a much smarter than

1455
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
You might want to

1456
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,359
That's always a better Pastor cowhide Infowars

1457
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Insist

1458
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
I'm going

1459
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
The other direction

1460
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,223
Because they have no faith in their audio

1461
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,439
This is not at all

1462
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
Kind of

1463
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,535
In-depth episode that I'm interested in getting back in

1464
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
To do next

1465
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,887
I miss doing this Saturday

1466
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
In a push-up contest

1467
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
John Bolton's book

1468
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,431
Apparently involves talk of trump working with has got to have a difficult time

1469
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,807
Another was that military executive order that Trump put through

1470
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
There is

1471
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,367
The Supreme Court rulings

1472
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,647
Today not today

1473
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
Naturally

1474
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,535
Yeah I would just think of this is the time that Alex needs to be in studio

1475
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,583
He's gone

1476
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,631
These are all stories that are begging

1477
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
For Alex to spin

1478
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,751
Just be Clarence Thomas in a push-up

1479
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Contest

1480
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,567
And then he did a notebook

1481
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,663
Absolutely and then she approved another one

1482
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,711
So

1483
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,271
So

1484
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,599
Really interested in why Alex isn't there and I guess we'll find out what is it

1485
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,391
Excuses whenever he gets back

1486
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:30,303
