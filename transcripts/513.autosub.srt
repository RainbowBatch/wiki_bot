1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Acknowledge

6
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Sequestered

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
What's up Jordan

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Whatsyourprice

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,520
My bright spot today is wonderful intersection of aspiration and limitations

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
All right.

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Finishing an inch

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
Tire Waffle House mail

13
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
I got

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Some sheet metal

15
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,296
From the local hardware store

16
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
The other day

17
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Because

18
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
It dawned on me

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,488
I love breakfast sandwiches and I can make them myself if I can't make

20
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Eggs round

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Right

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Just get some sheet metal

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
I could make a round thing

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
That I could put in

25
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
You're making your own car

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Cutouts

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Can cookie cutter

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Basically yeah

29
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Sheet metal

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
And you can just

31
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,384
Byam limitations

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,504
So I spent a while cutting up some metal

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,576
Cut myself or anything so that's a plus

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
But yeah I got to I got through a couple trials

35
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Sleeping out from under Rico

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Cuz it's not perfectly

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
What can I do how can I fix this until I Googled it as like I do they cost

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
8 bucks for four of them

39
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,568
What was your thought process

40
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
I was taking a walk to get out of the house and I saw the hardware store and I like the hardware guys

41
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
And I was like oh I've been

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,392
I had that thought about it round eggs when I see if they have anything that I could

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Sheet metal in there and so I did and

44
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Well

45
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
It felt fun

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,608
Aspiration face-veil really fun like I'm being crafty I'm trying to build something

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
And I did six

48
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,008
We just wasn't that good sure I made something that works like I think Patty

49
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
Sure they just weren't great and they did leave a little bit

50
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
But they were around you win some you lose

51
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
I considered a partial victory

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,296
That I've been forfeited to buying Grey Cup

53
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
I think that you even tried to construct your own as a victory in another itself yeah I feel better I feel better for trying but

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Kelso

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Qualified

56
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Yeah

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
I think you are so technically weekend

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
I have that

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Yeah that's

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Could you do I need a 6 to fix

61
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Easy project

62
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,176
Avon

63
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
Try really hard and then I'm going to buy a chair

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,856
If my weekend I don't have any like

65
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
Tribbing to do because you would have a series of

66
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,792
Chainsaws that you should there be a nightmare and I'll probably not I'll probably stop just short of

67
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,912
I don't know if you were called you remember

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
A few weeks ago when I

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Talk to you about the man

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Yeah

71
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
And it was what I said

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Do you was that it was a it was a really

73
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Was like

74
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
Gorilla Glue everything you want

75
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Co-op you know

76
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
And the season finale was

77
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Such that it

78
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
It was just

79
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
I can't even without spoilers like

80
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
Can't even begin to describe it because

81
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
It was like I could

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,351
Could feel myself in the writers room they say the baby Yoda's name isn't Grogan

83
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
I thought I would figure that'll be a nice twist the person who arrived

84
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Nana

85
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Your baby

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,175

87
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Directly

88
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,527
It was very much like a I didn't I knew it was

89
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
But I never thought they would

90
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Okay have you think I would

91
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
Liken it to have you ever seen a wrestling pay-per-view perhaps when you were younger

92
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
Yes you all the sudden you heard the music

93
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Sure you were like

94
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
They didn't hear the glass break at Stone Cold Cut it up

95
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
So cold and it was him

96
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
It's like that but if your childhood came back in

97
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103

We got

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Nothing that could go over

178
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
And that is going to be a lot of hours

179
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
Because Alex Jones did double-duty on Friday

00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183

188
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895

00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
No problem

192
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Before that

193
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
Because he would fire David Knight the day before

194
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
He needed to fill that

195
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
Time something had to go there

196
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Enter what he decided to do

197
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,863
Was finally do that show that was mostly colors

198
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Okay

199
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
So he's decided

200
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
You going to start a new show called The American Journal

201
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
Out of here at the American Journal it's a parody

202
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
I say the parody he would say it's an omage

203
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Canton journal on C-Span

204
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Right and it's these has that

205
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,879
About a hundred times that sounds right the three-hour show

206
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Take his audience

207
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Forget the reference

208
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
He does really hammered home

209
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
It's like God I walked

210
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Good Journal but it's America

211
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
So here's now to contacts dropped from one of the colors

212
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
On the American journey

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,335
People that think that this Kobe shot is going to cure them or even make them into a cyborg human being

214
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
They're wrong

215
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
It is not it is going to kill them

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,783
Pulse of America

217
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Take that would be a fairly good

218
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
Chronicle of art. All these people out there who think the shots going to turn him into a cyborg they're wrong

219
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Idiot

220
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,399

248
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919

We're going to take calls

252
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
I'm going to say a million times that this is

253
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Like the Washington Journal but I'm doing it

254
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
I'm going to

255
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Complain a whole bunch

256
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
Last half-hour cuz

257
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
I got to take a break in between this advice

258
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
Take a calls it the last half-hour is John Rappaport not take a call

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
He's not on his feet

260
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Ridiculous

261
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Alex realizes that

262
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Now I told the guy months ago

263
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
I had an idea

264
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
I told the crew

265
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
For something like

266
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
A

267
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Let's buy another

268
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
National

269
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Journal program has been, washed

270
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Doing right now

271
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
It is Friday December 18th

272
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,799
2020 I was looking up there on the computer board that said December

273
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
17/2020 and I said

274
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
That's not right

275
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Friday December

276
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
18 ft horse

277
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Play you can't

278
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Always proud

279
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Computers Canyon

280
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Sometimes

281
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Computers lie to you

282
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,647
We need to be aware of is the Washington Journal the one where it's

283
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
The guy who is steadfast in his not having a facial expression like somebody calls in and

284
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
How old is world news like

285
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
That was a good call the ex caller Republican and Democrat live

286
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,079
Alright

287
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,967
I will tell you right round one he is not alright

288
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
He is he is not

289
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,343
I just thought I mean like it would be like if the Washington Journal host

290
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Constantly like

291
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Forgot why he was there

292
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
That would that's kind of the way you would make it leak all right I like it

293
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
But the aspiration is there much like me trying to make these egg rolls

294
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
To take 90% calls

295
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Here we are

296
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Months ago

297
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
That I wanted to watch a show either in the morning

298
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Or at night

299
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
And call it

300
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
National Journal

301
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
Kind of after the Washington Journal

302
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
Curly habituate myself remember the house would be

303
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Avocados are rotating

304
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
To take a lot of phone calls and actually do it everyday because

305
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
The shallows base

306
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Police 90%

307
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
On phone call

308
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
And so that is what we are

309
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Doing

310
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Iran this live

311
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Friday December

312
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
18th

313
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
2020 Rock

314
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
I will give Alex some credit

315
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
And say that

316
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
More calls than you'd

317
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Based on his history sure

318
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
It's still not 90%

319
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Back

320
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
And some of them are talking about

321
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Turn into a cyborg

322
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
So then some of them

323
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
As well not have

324
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
That's fair

325
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
And one of them has guy named Mountain Patriot

326
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Okay

327
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Was that his birthday

328
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,215
Yeah on his new birth certificate became a sovereign

329
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
Here's where I want to make a request of you taking notes

330
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
A large

331
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Portion of this

332
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Turns into Alex

333
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Complaining about David

334
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
There is

335
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,063
A large part of this episode is like

336
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,951
Kind of too aware that people are going to tune into taking its David

337
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Address the issue

338
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Mount

339
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
On the 17th

340
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Episode that we listen to on our last episode

341
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
We heard him give

342
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Big explanation

343
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
That

344
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
It's money

345
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Funny I got Financial

346
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Troubles around here

347
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Where to scale back and get leaner

348
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
The top of your nose

349
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
So where about

350
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
To find out that it's actually about

351
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
The number of

352
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
Emails David night since

353
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,951
Dog that doesn't come out all right we had our saw that it was maybe Steve

354
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,023
Genic related because the two of them got into a bit of a Beat

355
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
They got it all though also I

356
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
A little reticent

357
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,887
And about that or I had to been

358
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
I want you to keep track

359
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,079
How many different possible react I want you to listen

360
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
Carefully and see how many different stories

361
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
About why David got fired you could come up with the toilet

362
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
The first one to give you this as Ally Auto

363
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Now a lot of your probably turning and you're saying where's David Knight

364
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,583
I love David Knight I really care about him as a talented smart guy

365
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
He's been with us 9 years

366
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
And I personally am exhausted too emotional everyday

367
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
And a David of course

368
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
The god quite a bit

369
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Over a year ago with some medical issues

370
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Came back

371
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
And I just

372
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Made the decision

373
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
That David

374
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Was not happy

375
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
I made the decision good for him

376
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Still be on here

377
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
About personal decision

378
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
All kind of watching a Twist in the Wind

379
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Very depressed where that's going on

380
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
And I grew about 95% of what they would have

381
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
At the same way.

382
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,287
I did not let David go because I disagree with what he was doing well because he didn't agree with me on something

383
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
I had nothing to do with

384
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
Alright

385
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,015
To do with the fact that David Knight was unhappy bio Alex's metric

386
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
Yes it was unhappy but he couldn't save himself

387
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Miserable

388
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Did it for him

389
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,095
They only accept that doesn't sound right but okay

390
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Do you think you don't

391
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
I just don't think we're going to find out that this is

392
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
Does a consistent store that buy

393
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,527
So what other possibility for why you might have gotten the exes that Alex wanted to do this call-in show and David

394
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Did not

395
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
I have wanted

396
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
To Launch

397
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Again a program like

398
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Washington Journal bonacio

399
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Jarrell

400
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
David was not a

401
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Instead the program like

402
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
We had

403
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
First one to have a show that he would host

404
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
What's calls

405
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Yesterday

406
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
When are The Rush

407
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
So here we are

408
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
When I host the show or 10 and host

409
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
What other people are looking at bringing in the house

410
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
And show

411
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Then that person won't be host

412
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
So I kind of got in a rut not the bad way but

413
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
It's a right

414
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
But I don't think

415
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
And I really in a rut that I'm playing a

416
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
But I tend to get on one story

417
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
And pontificate on it for an hour

418
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Somewhat informative for DieHard lifters

419
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
But it's not for radio and TV station

420
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Really

421
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Cumbersome quick news

422
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Get into it

423
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Takeoff

424
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Adequate gas

425
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Early cycle

426
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Through a lot of information

427
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Enfield

428
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Put the show is going to be

429
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
Going to meet your phone call

430
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
I agree with Alex on some level is inaccessible to people who aren't already indoctrinated

431
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
Yes the format that he has is not good

432
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,911
Before someone like clicking around on the radio to grab your attention with a guy yelling

433
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
But he doesn't yell all the

434
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
Yeah there's a lot of stretches of time that are completely boring

435
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Stupid shusher

436
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
And you know if you aren't already on the team

437
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
What about that I mean there's that and also the mythology

438
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,807
He's just moved on so much for reality

439
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,927
Like you're you're coming in on like episode 40 of the 38

440
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Season yeah you're not going to

441
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Catch up with all the tapping

442
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,583
I listen to this all the time and sometimes I lose track of the Lord

443
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
It's nonsense exact

444
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,983
It would be something that would be

445
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
Very very difficult for you to get people in the door

446
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,967
The same College

447
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,575
The switch-up is format in order to maybe cater to an audience

448
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Goodbye

449
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207
I'm going to stick with the other what we got

450
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
Say that David is smart

451
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
For not wanting to do a call-in show

452
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
Just simply because

453
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
You've also cultivated an audience that you don't

454
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
I want to hear what they have

455
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
How to say

456
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
True it's true you would like to try and pretend like you take this all very serious

457
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,687
60% exposure shitzu

458
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Something you lose credibility by

459
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Having two humor idiot

460
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Go to polite

461
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
To tell people to shut up

462
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
People who think they're going to be cyborgs are stupid

463
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
They're going to die

464
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
Oh alright

465
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
I am a cyborg

466
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
What

467
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
We're going to be taking a

468
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
Lot of your phone call so I'll give you the number

469
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
When we come back

470
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,432
And part of taking phone calls is going to be

471
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,552
We are going to get your call and move the next

472
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
Thank you for calling though thank you so much Alex

473
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Oh and a minion what you have to say we're just going to

474
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Hey

475
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Calling in

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Here's the topic

477
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Mobile.

478
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Another topic the next hour

479
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
And that's how this is going to be

480
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
Something other than Polly done personally

481
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
20 years

482
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
American Journal

483
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Ryback

484
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
What's this mellow ass music this is very straight

485
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,784
This is real 8 in the morning that I wasn't coffee and wasn't

486
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Netflix

487
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,464
I've been awake before 9 and 20 years it's the real on a lot of levels

488
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Sitting there with the

489
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Like a calm

490
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,448
Oregon

491
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
What starts off after he gets back from

492
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Commercial with a introducing the first top

493
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
NYU wants to do this is he wants to have

494
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Our block

495
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
I meant it so he has like

496
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,504
Alright we have our first topic we're taking calls on that topic next hour

497
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
I'll introduce another topic will take calls on that top picture

498
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,720
We got a framework I'm not sure if it works out the way you wanted to but here is the first.

499
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
And feet

500
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
Pasta salad Falls the ground and be taken out later on a stretcher

501
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
So easy just

502
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
I forgot he played a clip

503
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
From Tennessee of a nurse

504
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
Who is giving a little bit of a talk to reporters

505
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
After getting the vaccine

506
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Coronavirus vaccine

507
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
And she faint

508
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
After

509
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
Play the audio of that but he was really bad

510
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
I've decided to start this after

511
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
The the auto is it was just

512
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Unlistenable

513
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
And he

514
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
Talon Falls the ground had me taken out later on the stretcher

515
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
And I thought a press release

516
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
On local ABC news saying

517
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
So it's quite normal

518
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Collapse like this

519
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
When you take any vaccine

520
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
So this video of the nurse in Tennessee was circulating on social media and man it is all of the Optics you wouldn't want

521
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
If you're trying to reassure people about the safety

522
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Covid-19

523
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,016
But it's still something that's being used this honestly

524
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
Nurse Tiffany Dover was answer a question

525
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Confirm reporters about getting the vaccine at which point she said she was feeling dizzy

526
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
And momentarily fainted

527
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
She later explained that she has a

528
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Condition where she faints

529
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Richie fields

530
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
And it was unlikely something

531
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Been caused by the vaccine

532
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,424
How much is also just lying about the video and making up

533
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Details about it

534
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Most glaringly that she had to be carried out on a

535
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Stretcher

536
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
According to the Associated Press

537
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
Quotes Dover was back on her feet shortly after passing out

538
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,224
As it turns out this is just a reaction that some people have to any kind of

539
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
Shot and most doctors believe it's related to pain or anxiety

540
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
You could easily see someone with a history of fainting when experiencing pain

541
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:33,024
Having that Amplified by the anxiety of being on news getting one of the first vaccines for a pandemic

542
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
It's f****** up everyone's life to about a year

543
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
I do grant that the optic

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Are not what you want here at all

545
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
If you're just someone who doesn't care about

546
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Details and go up emotional reactions

547
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
The surface-level appearances

548
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
Then this will be very powerful

549
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
In terms of painting the vaccine is dangerous

550
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Which I guess is the first topic

551
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
But for the American Journal

552
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,856
Yeah I'm not going to I'm not going to say that it wouldn't be a smarter I did not to have like

553
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Southern Belle from the 18th

554
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
70s

555
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
First

556
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Oh my God

557
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,096
But I will say that when I got the hepatitis vaccine

558
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Before I went

559
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
To South Africa is my partner

560
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
I passed out

561
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848
Like I was sitting on the chair and I had to go down on the ground and lay on the floor

562
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Cuz it was such a

563
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Huge vaccine to

564
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
It was a yeah

565
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
I've not had that experience but I've definitely seen it

566
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
Some people like

567
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
When they give blood they can have a chance of passing out or

568
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
Or even like

569
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,304
See people giving blood whatever the charcot of that some some people

570
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
I get a lot of

571
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
Response

572
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
But there's more to be worried about

573
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Out with this vaccine I guess

574
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
This is also what Alex wants to talk

575
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
You know it says on the inserts that it

576
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
This is not a normal vaccine if even worse

577
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
It's an mRNA vaccine

578
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Programs

579
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Every major cell group in your body

580
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
The British quote

581
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Protein

582
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Stop the virus

583
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
Do same proteins happen to be in the placenta

584
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
That's what also block

585
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Having a baby in the bed

586
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Short talk that

587
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Children

588
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
A couple years

589
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
When you take some of the MRNA vaccine

590
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
I should have the medical reports

591
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
From Big Pharma

592
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,800
And the trials here in my stock today

593
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
Yes this is a conspiracy theory

594
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
This is a fact

595
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
So what else is talking about there is

596
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Complete nonsense

597
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
He was recently yelling about to be

598
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,088
B6 Destiny Pfizer trials which weed

599
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Disgusting recent episode

600
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,720
Forward in the group and two most likely not caused by the vaccine

601
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
That breaks down. They released which included that information is probably one of the best resources for information about the effects that but documented in

602
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,008
Should Alex says that he has this in his references this material

603
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
In that very document they say that

604
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,640
At the time of the data cut off which was November

605
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
2020

606
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
120

607
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,296
A total of 23 participants had reported pregnancies in the safety database

608
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,600
Including nine participants who withdrew from the study

609
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
We do to break

610
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,232
There's demographic information about the 43,000 people who are enrolled in

611
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,792
The study and I consider trying to whittle it down to see if

612
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:18,656
23 with a notably high or low number shorter pregnancies to see in that size group but

613
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,984
Honestly it would have been impossible to tell from the given information

614
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
You can make some general assumptions but even if you're able to get a vague number of the population in the study were able to get pregnant in the valley

615
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Likely age where they might

616
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
That still doesn't really help

617
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,808
You still have no idea how many of these people are sexually active how many were using birth

618
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Control etcetera

619
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:42,208
Without access to any of that data it seems to me that twenty-three Breakin seizes a fairly normal number

620
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
It also contradicts

621
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
All about

622
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,328
Aren't you sick of all these fact-checkers in

623
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
I hate

624
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm more important piece of info we can take from that fisa report is from table 23 towards the end of the report

625
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Which details

626
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Serious adverse event

627
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Experience in a study

628
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
There was one spontaneous abortion

629
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
That occurred in that group of 43,000

630
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Participants

631
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,528
Which was the only pregnancy or perinatal complication or condition that

632
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Was reported

633
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
This was someone in the placebo group

634
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
So it was not caused by the vaccine

635
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
There's a viral meme that Alex

636
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
To seeing it suggests that the vaccine will cause a

637
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Fertility but it's a lotus

638
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
The basic ideas at the spike

639
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,704
Protein using the vaccines the same as the protein that used by the body to create a

640
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Placenta

641
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
So the vaccine

642
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,824
Body to attack the very thing you need to develop in order to become pregnant

643
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
The protein is called

644
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Seitan

645
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
1

646
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,016
But the problem boils down to an elementary misunderstanding on the part of these viral meme

647
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
The vaccine uses a spike protein of

648
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
To which does Sherry small sequence of amino acid with

649
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
It's inciting one

650
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
Not close enough at all

651
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Similarity

652
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
To cause the kind of reaction that Alex

653
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
To suggest

654
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,960
This is just flimsy memebase nonsense that I was passing off his research at means nothing

655
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Also we have not yet to get

656
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Any calls

657
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Yeah it's one of those

658
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Does he know it is

659
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
It's one of those things where it's like it

660
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
You guys can't know about science

661
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
It's for now

662
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,504
You're just not ready to know a little bit about science you're going to hurt yourself

663
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
A little a little bit is worse than none you guys you guys just got

664
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
Hold off on science

665
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:20,256
We'll get to you you're going to learn it someday I guess it's like Devil magic in this area

666
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
Please

667
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
He's going to open the phones next segment

668
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
But he hasn't

669
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
These are leading

670
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Well I want to open the phone's up next Sunday

671
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
And I want to ask

672
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
All the listeners

673
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
All of the viewers at 8

674
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
777

675
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
8925

676
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
539

677
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Call the Radiolab

678
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
7778

679
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,672
925-397-7789 Alex

680
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
I want to ask you

681
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Are you planning to take the vaccine

682
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,584
If you're not what are you going to do when they try to pressure you

683
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,680
Or try to say it's mandatory they're doing in some foreign countries

684
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
Now pushing here

685
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,288
And then what do you make of the vaccine makers having liability protection

686
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Women if they hurt you

687
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
They don't get in any

688
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Scrabble

689
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,040
Like I love the idea that his first question is are you going to take the backseat obviously it from everybody

690
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
F*** no

691
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,648
Second question when you going to do when they force you to learn all that's

692
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:24,000
Swim around and violent fantasies totally about Justified Violence

693
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
The third Quest

694
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
None of them are equipped to have

695
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
A conversation about why companies have

696
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Liability protection

697
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
And what it means

698
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,544
Like that's something that no one who's calling in to show himself is prepared to

699
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,456
I mean I suppose one more question what it would be like how would it feel to be immune to disease

700
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
Does that sound exciting does anybody feel excited about is that a Stanley superpower watch this

701
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,904
Be hurt by this disease and it's cooked

702
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,232
Real stuff not cuz your mind Palace or whatever it is Imagine

703
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
Alex

704
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Does not

705
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Go to call

706
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Be realized

707
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Is that like

708
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
@david nights

709
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
Run again

710
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Today

711
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
You doing then

712
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
Running with the David Knight show is David's done a great job for nine years here

713
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
And job

714
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
David deserves a break

715
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
I really appreciate David Knight

716
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
And so I made the decision

717
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
How to go ahead

718
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
Now cancel that show he wants to do it on his own that's wonderful

719
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
Maybe someday I'll do something here which once a week or something

720
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
I just think that

721
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
It's very exhausting but I'm a mission

722
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
And it David

723
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Does NACA

724
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
What's your favorite doesn't give a f***

725
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Why did I think that it's a bad thing I'm leaving.

726
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
But to David

727
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
Alaska is a trooper to take care of himself

728
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,992
Yasso David nights not committed apparently he doesn't have a mission

729
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
Yeah like Alex on the Frontline if he's not let's leave it at that

730
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:01,024
Okay wait so now it's because he had performance-related

731
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,680
Will or ability

732
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
That's not just you being a nice guy he's not happy here exclamation

733
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
Alex

734
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
They might have been

735
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
Other influences

736
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
There's no controversy there's no there's no secret reason it's not

737
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Because he was bad

738
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Everyday

739
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm very frustrated with Trump

740
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
That has nothing to do with it

741
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Had to do what I just

742
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,232
Thinking about it praying about having dreams about David

743
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Worried about him

744
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Almost

745
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
So I just

746
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
I just thought I just said hey

747
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
That's that

748
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
So we

749
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
Frankford and he's a great guy doing great

750
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
But job

751
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
I will be right back

752
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
To get a dream

753
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
Breeze about the f*** dream about David night so he's gone

754
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:59,648
I thought the last straw was Alex learning the blacklivesmatter made 10 billion to Heller's

755
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:06,048
It's not about that

756
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
You're not committed to the cause of your fire

757
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,264
Section Pittsburgh what you would think based on what you say

758
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
But there's another explanation buried in there

759
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
I tried to save his life

760
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
He's going to die

761
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
I don't know

762
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Louder.

763
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
He does his show by itself

764
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
You know you would soon

765
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Is a decent chance

766
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
Alex has something he's got to deal with

767
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
Call Mike Pence

768
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
Got a shot

769
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
Yeah

770
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
Is he a cyborg or is he

771
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Dead well

772
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,568
I mean he's an enemy according to the you know

773
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Raira

774
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Still still would be troubling

775
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
If my plants got the shot that Alex is saying

776
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
I'm going to kill everyone

777
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
This is

778
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
Footage of the vice president just

779
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
30 minutes ago or so

780
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
Bonaire

781
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Taking the vaccine

782
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
I got to tell you they've caught

783
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,120
World leaders in Germany Japan other areas

784
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,680
Planning on taking a shot in the knot

785
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Taking it

786
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
Who's going to imply that it's a fake.

787
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
I mean I honestly

788
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,920
I think it's reasonable to just go with they get the rich guy shot right

789
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
It's more looking for a theory you could have make anything up then why not do that more reasonable to think that

790
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
The wealthy are getting better and different care now that it is to think they are taking the same shot

791
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:45,120
I think they're taking the understand what you're coming where you're coming from

792
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Get the medium

793
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
Alex has a tradition of talking about clean vac

794
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
Exactly why not

795
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
I don't know it he's already said that

796
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
Did the MRNA vaccine is

797
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,200
Better than the older type of vac

798
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Casino

799
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Alex's said

800
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
Although he dropped this narrative really quick when he realized he didn't know what he was talking about

801
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,928
He said the Trump was putting out the Pfizer vaccine

802
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
In order to

803
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
You cut Gates off at the pass

804
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
He was saying the gates wanted to do this evil one

805
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
So Trump was putting this out in order to put them in checkmate

806
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
He's just dumb

807
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:32,736
Narrative is no longer a play I'd rather Alex realized I didn't say that

808
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
It'll be smarter

809
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
So Alex finally gets

810
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Calls it's probably about

811
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
I would say 20 minutes in

812
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
Given like a commercial breaks maybe even a little longer

813
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Amman

814
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Done start great

815
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
American Journal

816
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Washington Journal

817
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
But American Journal

818
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Logical

819
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Lily and California are on the are on the covid

820
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Vaccine where do you stand on this

821
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Italy map

822
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Mark of the beast

823
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
No way

824
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
What a shock what is shock taking America's temperature

825
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Just just

826
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,552
All I all I all these calls are just going to sound like

827
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
That's it

828
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Mulatto

829
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
There's nothing

830
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,304
I don't know about that there's also going to be breaking that screeching though

831
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Plugs

832
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Mentioned very quickly

833
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
I want

834
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
Fellow lifters to know about

835
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Opportunity

836
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
Support the Infowars

837
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Not only

838
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Wood products

839
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
But that there's also

840
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
Unpack

841
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Hard to find

842
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
You make it very hard

843
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
I do it

844
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
But like 2 weeks ago

845
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
$50

846
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
Purchase lots of your product

847
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,464
Water filter and end

848
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
But right now especially given everything that you're doing

849
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
I just want to put the money in your head don't know how much I would have to spend

850
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Tickets for you to have

851
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936

00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
I'm Blown Away the first caller

Plugging giving him money yep

854
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,176
Not not not screening calls of course

855
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
Jamaica

856
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,296
That Alex plug the people could judge

857
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Just give you money without

858
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:19,232
He believed that all very shortly after announcing that you have to fire David B

859
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Because of money reasons

860
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
People are calling in saying that you know

861
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
And they're definitely not planted at all

862
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Kobe Crazy

863
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,960
Lily lily leaves

864
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
This is Mountain Patriot

865
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Let's go ahead and

866
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
Talk to

867
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Mountain Patriot

868
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,640
In Colorado thank you for holding

869
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
How you doing Alex

870
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Critical time brother how are you

871
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
I love you man

872
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Goodnight but

873
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
Totally understood we are at War

874
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
I want to make

875
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Plug

876
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,584
DNA Force

877
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
What are we doing

878
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
It gets really annoying really fast possible

879
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
It almost feels like a catfish

880
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
You know it is not necessarily planted calls or I do believe that there is a possibility

881
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Weirdest people

882
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,736
Hearing this happened over and over again you praying that like

883
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
Go the way of call goes with Alex's you

884
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Plug a product

885
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
The men then you talk

886
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Right right right

887
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Okay

888
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,512
This feels a little bit like I'm sure you haven't seen it but there's a movie called Phantom thread

889
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,328
Starting what's-his-name who's really good at Act

890
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
I've heard the name of that movie

891
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
And spoilers

892
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Essentially he's

893
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
He's like

894
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,568
Part of their sex life is she regularly

895
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
We poisoned him and

896
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
Takes care of him that's kind of a weird thing.

897
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
So he just likes getting poisoned

898
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,064
So I don't feel like what I'm hearing from all these people is like

899
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
I love getting poisoned by your product

900
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,720
That's just what I do I'll I want to send you $50

901
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,352
To trick myself into thinking that your pills do something for me

902
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
But because of Munchausen

903
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
I guess

904
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
I'm forcing myself to get

905
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,288
This conversation that we're having is actually really interesting because

906
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,104
It actually kind of touches on something that really

907
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
Scared me about Mountain Patriot

908
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Want to talk about

909
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Something called the

910
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
People expect that I haven't heard anyone mention in 9 Mile

911
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
Just all broke out

912
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
We've been inside

913
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Medicine they have

914
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
To do a double blind

915
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Study

916
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
That is

917
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
They have to

918
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
Do a double blind study

919
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
In order to eliminate

920
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Respect

921
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,240
Which is your own natural innate ability to heal

922
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Let's

923
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Call Matt

924
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Metaphor

925
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Coleman

926
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
They want to take our power away

927
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
Don't do that

928
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Terrifying

929
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Placebo effect as how we're Magic

930
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:54,624
This color legitimately thinks the placebo effect is a term that used to describe your body's natural ability to heal itself

931
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,256
Dodgers lose double-blind studies because they have to get rid of the possibility that you're just going to psychically heal yourself

932
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
What do you think you're getting medicine

933
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,120
First of all the colors talking about a single blind

934
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,704
That's when a participant doesn't know whether they're getting a medicine or the placebo

935
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:14,848
A double-blind studies when the people administering trial also don't know which participants are getting the real thing or the placebo

936
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,152
This is to remove any possible bias.

937
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
I could come from the researchers expecting certain

938
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Participants differently

939
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Depending on which group they're in

940
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
Double-blind studies are more

941
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Event for eliminating what's known as

942
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Observer Bias

943
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Both helper

944
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,072
Secondly the placebo effect does not describe actual healing

945
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
It's a phenomenon

946
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
In the brain

947
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,704
For instance if you're told that you're being given a pill to treat anxiety but

948
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
It's actually a placebo

949
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
The fact that you think

950
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
You're giving up being given

951
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,640
A pill that treats anxiety decreasing your anxiety

952
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,968
This is very interesting and complicated thing but it doesn't work like magic

953
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
If you have an infection

954
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
And you're given a placebo

955
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
It will not treat that infection now I'm pretty

956
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Experience

957
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,952
Pain relief or something like that but you will still have that infection

958
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Because the placebo is not

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,352
Treating the condition at all if you break your leg and they give you a fake

960
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
Pills

961
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,704
Heels legs your leg will heal naturally if you believe it

962
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Sure

963
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
A good way to understand this difference is by looking at a 2011 study from Harvard Medical School Endicott College in the University

964
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Steve Holt

965
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Researchers there were looking

966
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
To better understand the Dynamics

967
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
Placebo effect and symptom relief

968
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:30,880
So they designed to study where persons with asthma were given real and Placebo inhalers

969
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
As well as notes

970
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,952
Treatment and also sham

971
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,280
The study found that patients with Placebo inhalers

972
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
Evenly fake

973
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,936
Specifically Shamrock your real acupuncture

974
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:49,824
Justin eliminate another

975
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
It seemed really

976
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
It is weird

977
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
But

978
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,735
People with the placebo inhalers and even the fake acupuncture group

979
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
Subjectively reported feeling better

980
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
And they felt like yours

981
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,343
Symptoms are improve

982
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
However

983
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Both of these groups I got the

984
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
The full stream it showed no improvement

985
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
In terms of actual lung Fung

986
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,071
The actual asthma was not affected At All by the fake treatments but

987
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Some of the symptoms of asthma

988
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Could be alleviated

989
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,959
Sure this was not true of the group that got the medicine

990
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
In this case Albuterol

991
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Those people

992
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,311
Actually did have greater lung function

993
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
A break through the experience of getting treatment people can

994
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Experience a beneficial result

995
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
Do not be mistaken for

996
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Actual treatment

997
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
It's the people who got fake inhalers Worthen Force

998
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
To perform a task that

999
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
Required lung exertion

1000
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,927
They would be at a higher risk than the people who got the Albuterol

1001
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:43,839
This is the placebo effect the blind studies hope to minimize so they can test the effect of an actual medication is kind of side

1002
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Could have independent developer

1003
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Persons expectation

1004
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
Another kind of placebo

1005
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Which is basically Alex's busy

1006
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,567
This is where you convince people they have a fake Alma

1007
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
And you give them a placebo to cure it

1008
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
His pills won't really do anything

1009
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
But if he convinces you that your brain just won't work without his iodine

1010
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,319
They do take is iodine in your brain works fine

1011
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
Your tribute that to his iodine

1012
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Iodine deficiency

1013
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
He's a real condition

1014
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
But pretty much everyone listening to Alta show doesn't

1015
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
Have it

1016
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
Make you think

1017
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
You might

1018
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,655
It's a super profitable thing would you sell iodine you can manipulate that possibility

1019
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
Yeah I think the only thing that we

1020
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Confirm his product

1021
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Do or at least

1022
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
Points at heavily to his products owners

1023
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Is boners

1024
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:32,735
And that might even be psychosomatic but every time every time somebody talks about it there's never like

1025
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
I have more energy or like

1026
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
I feel more assertive it's always like

1027
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
My wife hates me now

1028
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:44,767
You know like it's never taken that maybe you have some kind of a mental block.

1029
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:49,631
Putting your ability to become aroused testosterone that you shove in your face

1030
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
Possible

1031
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,007
The fact that this color it was plugging Alex's product doesn't understand the

1032
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Placebo effect

1033
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Daddy's

1034
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Like

1035
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Art

1036
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
You can't have science so you don't

1037
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
You can't get over it though it's it's

1038
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,455
It's so

1039
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Traxia

1040
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
It's just a weird they're just not ready for

1041
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,135
They're just I just like how like Galileo admittedly he was

1042
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
But the people around them

1043
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Just weren't ready

1044
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Ready for science yet

1045
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,535
And he kept trying to give it to him and then he got trapped

1046
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
That was mainly cuz he was

1047
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
But

1048
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
It happens

1049
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,239
Ready for science

1050
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
You know what Alex's ready to do

1051
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
Fortnite

1052
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Decided to do this

1053
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Yesterday

1054
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,159
Just wants to show immediately bad idea

1055
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
Really regretting that we're all stressed out

1056
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
So much going on there's so much happening

1057
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Taking the day off

1058
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
I would watch David Knight this is a great guy

1059
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
Get ready

1060
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
4 hours

1061
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
In the morning before 8 a.m.

1062
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Then I would

1063
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
Sometimes you get off my show

1064
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
He would be either Studio research

1065
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Looking like

1066
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
He wasn't living hell

1067
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
Sounds like dude you got

1068
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
To not work

1069
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
16 hours.

1070
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Computers out

1071
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Just insane

1072
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Isn't that what you say you do

1073
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,327
So that we said he was fired David cuz he worked too hard

1074
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Too hard

1075
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,263
The man is too committed to the that's why I had to fire it I've never seen him in flip-flops

1076
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
Stop.

1077
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
So we have both

1078
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
He's not committed

1079
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,687
He doesn't care enough and that's why I can't be on the front line

1080
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
And also

1081
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,831
He works too hard and he researches all the time he's just too committed here it's 4 in the morning

1082
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
He's not committed to the

1083
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
He's treating this as if it's some kind of job

1084
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,047
None of it makes sense

1085
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,351
A little bit internally in consist

1086
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
But it is fun

1087
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
To just hear him like

1088
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,775
Go all over the place whatever whatever the actual reason behind it

1089
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
Because

1090
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
He needs a break

1091
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Alec needs a break right

1092
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
I just want to have it clean

1093
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Play Break was just

1094
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Yesterday morning

1095
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,295
Watch them on the show and worried about it

1096
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
It's also Financial issue

1097
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,559
That much whatever this great job it is just that we don't have enough crew to run all these shows

1098
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
And they're burnout

1099
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,679
And the night over do you know a few people's wives or whatever

1100
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,263
They had to leave and take care of them and

1101
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
It is just been

1102
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
NASCAR

1103
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Hasn't even had

1104
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
The engine

1105
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
Mallards Fire come out of the engine

1106
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Taking off all next week

1107
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,647
I never take off a full week I always work

1108
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Where I'm at

1109
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
I'm going

1110
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Literally

1111
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Hide my phone

1112
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
I told my wife last night

1113
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Put your phone up

1114
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
I want to spend time with the family and I'm of the disconnect

1115
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Come back five years younger

1116
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,543
I believe he probably is going to take the week off but it's also

1117
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,919
I mean he deserves a break so he's going to do something out of this world

1118
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
And take

1119
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Wake up Christmas off

1120
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,039
Some people would never dream of doing that

1121
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,623
I'm going to take him to his word everybody

1122
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:27,231
Believe videos actually can take a week off and we'll see if he does or not

1123
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,327
He's talking about like what's going to happen on the shows

1124
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
This morning show and Maya show

1125
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Gauntlet

1126
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,639
Going to host the the War Room

1127
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,687
We have a mandate

1128
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
82

1129
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:54,111
4825 everyday going to get your chops man Aisha

1130
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,927
Night you got to get your chops going so you might as well

1131
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
12

1132
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,071
Absurd

1133
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,423
Call Lynn chaudin The Sensational

1134
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,263
A Libro down

1135
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,895
That's not going to work another caller who has a interesting question

1136
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Everything that you said

1137
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,271
Leaving your essential vitamins and minerals that should be enough

1138
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
Nobody needs

1139
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Vaccines

1140
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
On top of everything else

1141
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
What's wrong with them

1142
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
My daughter is

1143
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
A mortician in Arizona

1144
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
And

1145
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
She won't listen

1146
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
She used to be open-minded and I don't know how to get through to her

1147
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
And I just want to know if you have any suggestions

1148
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
Well I mean I'm sure you've seen the band

1149
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
Videos

1150
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
Changing overblown fraud and that all these cops

1151
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Scientist saying

1152
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
John Hopkins report

1153
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,943
The came out this year

1154
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,503
And there was the time last year of other things

1155
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,063
Show me the overall death rates not up

1156
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
That means they're moving other deaths

1157
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Affluent

1158
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
Pneumonia and other things into the covid

1159
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Column

1160
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
Which we know they're doing

1161
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
Imagine why this lady's mortician daughter is not listening to her. The virus being overblown

1162
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,751
Daughter is working also 12-hour days and she just doesn't believe

1163
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:20,127
But she looks nice she looks real sad now that's really waiting on her

1164
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
Are you know Alex's narrative here's a load of s***

1165
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
Here's what happened with that John top

1166
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Considering that he's talking about

1167
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,951
On November 13th an economics lecturer Johns Hopkins used fault

1168
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
Cdata to assert that there was no evidence of excess deaths in the United

1169
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
States this year

1170
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,423
The numbers in analysis this lecture were using where Elementary and didn't take him to a got a bunch of relevant

1171
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Variables

1172
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
Where is Pure reviewed studies that follow are your standards and regularly shown on approximately 20% increase in mortality this year

1173
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Over long-term average

1174
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:57,759
This wasn't the study or report it was a misrepresentation of data that was delivered in a lecture

1175
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
This claim was then

1176
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Covered of the John's

1177
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,135
Hopkins student newspaper the Johns Hopkins

1178
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Newsletter

1179
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
Naturally as soon as people notice

1180
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Is the paper retracted

1181
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Historian issued a correction

1182
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,631
In the meantime however the Gateway pundit and found the article and began reporting on the erroneous

1183
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
Play made by the econ lecturer

1184
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
The right-wing

1185
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
Conspiracy narrative is at the lecture is correct in the door track

1186
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,079
Action is a cover-up of this obviously a Curative

1187
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Information

1188
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
That's a bunch of nonsense

1189
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
Even the Gateway pundit sprayman of the

1190
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
The story is intentionally misleading

1191
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
Their headline was quote

1192
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Johns Hopkins

1193
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,831
Can study mysteriously disappears after it revealed in

1194
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,159
In spite of covid-19 more deaths in 2020 than in Prior years

1195
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
There was no study to disappear

1196
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
It was just a fabricated and sensationalized headlines

1197
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,887
You can follow the thread from right-wing bulshit website reporting on blog posts

1198
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
From another right-wing bulshit website

1199
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,007
All the way back to the student newspaper article that has been retract

1200
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,335
Even in that article they say that the lecturer quote

1201
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,455
Also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of covid-19

1202
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
All deaths in the United States

1203
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,599
So basically you have an economics lecturer gave a talk where she and accurately interpreted

1204
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
I'm covered by a student newspaper

1205
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,487
Which was then inaccurately reported on by dumb right-wing blogs

1206
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,327
Student article was retracted which the right-wing blogs been made part of the

1207
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Conspiracy horse

1208
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
This is been reported on by Alex as Johns Hopkins

1209
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,239
Proving in a study that there's no excess 2020

1210
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,335
20-minute covid deaths are all a hoax or just other deaths shuffled over

1211
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
Which is what this caller should then tell her mortician daughter

1212
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
Open her mind about vaccine denialism

1213
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,015
Hellboy American Journal

1214
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
IUI

1215
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
I do not want to denigrate

1216
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
Student newspapers at all during the protest in Chicago student newspapers did a

1217
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,535
A million times better job than any other local

1218
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,095
Local media and especially better than the national media

1219
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Aspire

1220
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,215
In Chicago at the same time

1221
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
Still a student newspaper week

1222
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
Can't be

1223
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,639
The right-wing can't be like a student newspaper did something so

1224
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,455
It's it's sort of a it's hard to

1225
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,551
It's hard to make a like a full statement dog

1226
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Okay yeah some

1227
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
Student journalist

1228
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
Are amazingly capable

1229
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,183
And can do good work

1230
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,999
But also some mistakes that wouldn't happen

1231
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,327
In professional newsrooms can happen it student newspapers

1232
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,655
Because this dude knows exactly it's

1233
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
The knife Cuts both ways

1234
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
Pitstop totally

1235
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
Another caller

1236
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,359
Take a few calls here before nothing but

1237
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
Story

1238
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Holding the longest

1239
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
Would be

1240
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,039
Dental on Kirkman Oklahoma Kirk welcome

1241
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
There is nothing better

1242
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Nothing more

1243
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Comfy

1244
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
I'm waking up

1245
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,975

1247
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,095
Calling in

The American Journal

1249
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,031
That's right sir while we're honored to be here with Levi taking your calls what is your view on this situation with the vaccine

1250
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
So it does guys plugging Alex's coffee

1251
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Yeah

1252
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
It's very frustrating

1253
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,527
Oh there's nothing more relaxing than drinking your coffee and calling into the first

1254
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
Episode of your show

1255
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
It said some sort of like

1256
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
Among

1257
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Infowars like

1258
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
DieHard listeners that's

1259
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,999
Some sort of meme like a way they communicate with

1260
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,815
Each other like I said okay if you plug a cannoli

1261
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:29,215
We're salt we're also used to Alex plug-in like is that part of like a a medic language

1262
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
It's possible and I also

1263
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
Think of it a lot of times Alex's ads end up using colors in them because there was I need your help

1264
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:43,295
Hoping

1265
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,903
Commercial that Alex uses

1266
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
1314

1267
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
Call and request

1268
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,511
The song on the radio they call Daddy

1269
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,399
DJ's I was hoping that they would record it and use it to introduce you at all sure sure sure and maybe that's the same thing

1270
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
But they're adults

1271
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Yeah

1272
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,007
They're trying to help Alex sell pills

1273
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,847
That's a little bit less eyes at its lower on the totem pole than Rick

1274
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Yeah

1275
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,223
Playboy that color just in case you were worried about

1276
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
In case you're curious

1277
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Stop

1278
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
Talking about David Knight

1279
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:26,303
And I intend to house this time I didn't get other house or going to rotate through many David out of one sometime

1280
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,143
I'ma show TV or something I was just regular

1281
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
Swap last 4 years

1282
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,007
And I just abruptly decided yesterday to

1283
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:39,103
In that show shutdown I just was just my gut-level thing to do

1284
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
The right thing to do

1285
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,991
For the world because a country

1286
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,063
He's been worn out exhausted by this just like I am

1287
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
My gut

1288
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,671
Is a pronoun for the putting out last week

1289
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999

Really smart guy

1298

The election

1299
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
You're making ham soup

1300
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,647
Oh okay okay so now

1301
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,207
He's pissed off not okay first

1302
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,791
Uncomfortable about political disagreements about

1303
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
But Alex

1304
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
Totally cool

1305
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
Totally cool

1306
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,775
Also the whole thing about the promotional materials being sent out last week

1307
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,847
It sounds like nobody picked up David Knight show so they

1308
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,943
Canterbury that's possible but allowances trying to use that as evidence

1309
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
What's that like

1310
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,039
We've got more support behind David

1311
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,343

Cruises

1313
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,671
Like maybe it was a snap decision

1314
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:03,071
Yeah that's all nobody puts up his show if you've been racking your brain

1315
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
I'm so worried about how much work

1316
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
He puts in

1317
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,727
The fact that emotional materials that came out last week doesn't help

1318
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,055
I mean like who everybody so

1319
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,615
Tune to the vagaries of the

1320
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Is a TV show

1321
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
Business now

1322
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
That there's a part of the

1323
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,015
Why don't you say that we didn't pick up a show again

1324
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,087
Right like it's not hard right

1325
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,439
So easy and everybody be like oh there was a reason but they just didn't pick up the shower

1326
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:34,815
Shut up Heroes didn't get a third season and was like what yeah they didn't pick up the show

1327
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
It's

1328
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Or did it get it

1329
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,983
I know they had a comeback it was bad it's not good

1330
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Book dude

1331
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
There are 100 ways you could do this

1332
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,407
And none of it requires any of this s***

1333
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
60 reasons

1334
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:57,087
Some of which are I'm a hero in the others are David I disagree with many of the others are insane

1335
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,879
But we do have one

1336
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,975
Explanation for his termination okay we get crossed off the

1337
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Okay

1338
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
One thing I definitely had nothing

1339
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
To do with it does have both feet

1340
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Add during the breaker like yeah

1341
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
People think you got rid of David because of

1342
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Steve pieczenik

1343
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,799
Keep my mind those two fighting with each

1344
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
It was him

1345
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,919
Zero-zero-zero

1346
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
How to do

1347
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
David was very Ashton very white

1348
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,087
Wow

1349
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,391
And I thought about Tony diesel

1350
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
At that point

1351
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
And I almost did it then

1352
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
I got a massive heart attack and almost died

1353
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,351
I need to look in the same and that I'm that's it

1354
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,399
Personal issue

1355
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
I care about David

1356
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
He needs a break

1357
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
Oh man

1358
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:52,895
It's not speak now there's nothing that makes me know it's even more than him being like

1359
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
I never thought about it

1360
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
0 possible

1361
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
0 possibility

1362
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,039
Me more suspicious

1363
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,391
And this is one of those instances where it's not

1364
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Just you and I have

1365
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,583
Saying that

1366
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,703
It's a lot of people on Twitter have been

1367
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
About how

1368
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
Steve sucks

1369
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,823
Is a little bit more of a public thing

1370
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
Public duty

1371
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,151
Just work too hard that's all it is he was Ashen

1372
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
I care about David

1373
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
He needs a break

1374
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,807
4 hours before the show getting ready 3 hours of a show

1375
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
Weber hours after

1376
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Studying

1377
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
Looking like he's in hell

1378
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
And so

1379
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
Fire him

1380
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
10 a.m. over there

1381
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
I got to go let David go

1382
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
What should I do at clean and then be done

1383
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,983
What are you going to do

1384
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,519
What stations pick that up

1385
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
This is a real conversation

1386
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,919
I said I know I just can't

1387
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
On the evil anymore

1388
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
I know how David feels

1389
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,271
And then you feel like you're not doing enough

1390
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,855
And then I and then your brain went on a dopamine and then I'm super

1391
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Exhausted

1392
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
And I don't even have time with my

1393
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
My children

1394
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
I should just take off next week

1395
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
But I had to make

1396
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,047
That decision

1397
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Because I didn't make the

1398
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
My gut told me to do it

1399
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,887
The last time

1400
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
He almost died

1401
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
Okay

1402
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,239
I told God this I've told you this

1403
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,775
I'm doing my gut now

1404
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
.

1405
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
Cuz it's never been wrong

1406
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,127
I've been following my whole life

1407
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,199
And the more I saw them I got the more I never make mistakes

1408
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,503
I'm not going to put into all the reason

1409
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,087
Of why it happened it has zero to do with Steve pieczenik

1410
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
Okay so who's Steve

1411
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Yeah they think it's

1412
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
So I might involve this Twitter beef

1413
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,583
Batman Justice playground on alright

1414
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:54,751
I will I will put that down

1415
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
Come on man

1416
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
I'm pissed off

1417
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,615
People.

1418
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
All you have to say

1419
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
Or it could just be like a person

1420
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Yeah

1421
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
You know how many people have left Infowars in the past

1422
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,415
Yahoo few of them anyone care who is gone now

1423
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:19,327
I can't imagine I mean I guess there's some like Old-Timers are probably like I'm sorry where is Lee Ann McAdoo Butler

1424
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,655
No one cares now

1425
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,215
David and I had it exist

1426
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
A creative disagreements

1427
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
Since I let it go

1428
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,615
I honestly think that the financial thing is probably your best play

1429
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
Stuck to that

1430
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,943
Yeah because that Alyssa

1431
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Support from the audience who want to see

1432
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
See your thing not

1433
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
Here it doesn't

1434
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,647
Require you to get into the mud with David about how he works too hard with

1435
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
Too confusing Wild

1436
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Cuz he's also not

1437
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:51,839
Committed it all to the info are his workload seems to be less than you pretend you have for yourself

1438
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
Sickly

1439
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,655
Too complicated just have

1440
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:59,263
But we had a really good salary right and we couldn't carry it into the next

1441
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,311
Quarter or whatever

1442
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
That would be

1443
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
Adult right

1444
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,407
But because

1445
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,455
It is definitely personal

1446
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:13,855
He just can't stick to the story is personal and so we can't stick to the

1447
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,927
There's a mystery here and I think what I might need to

1448
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
To do on Alex

1449
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Cuz week off

1450
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
This could be painful as hell

1451
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,143
I might have to go through the last shows the David Knight did and now I'm kind of a clue

1452
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:31,007
I don't know maybe there will be I don't know that would be a terrible Christmas episode

1453
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
I just hope

1454
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
Hope that Alex

1455
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
Jones fires me for the next

1456
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,639
Think I'm about to say

1457
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,199
I am working too hard

1458
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
So Alex

1459
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
It's off.

1460
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Spec for a moment

1461
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,367
Everybody noticed my ashen-faced lately

1462
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
Leaving aside Alex's

1463
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Anger

1464
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
I am confusion

1465
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
About what exactly

1466
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
Yes or no

1467
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,631
I told you

1468
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Broad

1469
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
You think it's bold

1470
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,543
Overthrow the government

1471
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,335
Economist Chinese agent

1472
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,895
And he put all his people in for the Pentagon

1473
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,455
A key positions in sells the American people

1474
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,039
On a limited form of Martial law the general Flynn another's

1475
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,343
I rightfully called for when you call martial law

1476
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,183
When there is a foreign power that is occupied

1477
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
That is what the definition says

1478
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
Reason for martial law

1479
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Under

1480
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
U.s. military history

1481
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Wow

1482
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,191
Sometimes us refused for interactions are

1483
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,775
It is a Tricom takeover we are infiltrated

1484
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,895
Joe Biden does work for China deadline say he was a president they did steal these key areas

1485
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
We have all the evidence

1486
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
We bear Melanie the new election

1487
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
Wow

1488
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,855
So the 64 thing or 60 something X martial law has been declared is

1489
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:54,719
Alex is just repeating from an interview with Mike Floyd

1490
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,791
How many times do you think martial law has been declared

1491
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Since WWII

1492
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,631
Since WWII

1493
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,935
999 * 19

1494
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
It's okay you know what

1495
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Five of them

1496
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,615
I found this in an article for 1989 Hindi Law & Order Journal

1497
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:17,503
WWII soe five of them I would almost guarantee or during the Civil Right There

1498
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,319
Quote in five instances it was designed

1499
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
Counter resistance to Federal.

1500
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,159
Desegregation decrees in the south

1501
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
There we go half the time and kind of Martial law has been used

1502
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
Desegregation is a communist plot

1503
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
It's it's

1504
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
It's you

1505
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,079
You know what I was thinking this

1506
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
If

1507
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Trump overthrows the government

1508
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,919
Does he still get to key

1509
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Keep the POTUS

1510
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,759
Twitter account

1511
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
When buying becomes red

1512
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
Do we got

1513
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
Dodus dictatorship

1514
01:03:54,879 --> 01:04:01,023
Watermelon related

1515
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
Kim Jong

1516
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
Trump

1517
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,887
That would be good when at conjunction

1518
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,727
I don't know man I think that Jack would have a really tough

1519
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:15,103
To make it that point whether he wants to die or

1520
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
I don't know we'll see

1521
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,967
Billionaires generally are willing to Die For a Cause

1522
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,039
Bare minimum

1523
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
New election

1524
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
Right there man

1525
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Yeah

1526
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
Which everybody in the United States will accept

1527
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:32,767
Something that we are all like you know what we got to get to the bottom of it

1528
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,815
Minimum new election

1529
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
Drawback to culture

1530
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
How to take a call from a guy named Baldy

1531
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,495
Baldi in Florida Baldi you're down at the bottom and I miss you sorry go ahead

1532
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,079
This is a reminder I'm the one that all through March was

1533
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
Calling begging and pleading with everyone to realize

1534
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
April Fool's virus

1535
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,039
Real quick I do not remember Baldi from that Network

1536
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,135
Before I get my ball debriefing on the pending inoculations

1537
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,927
A regular segment

1538
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,399
What's connection

1539
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Speakerphone

1540
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Is this better

1541
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Say it again

1542
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,319
Oh boy

1543
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,647
Go to a college going to happen

1544
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:38,559
It doesn't happen more frequently during this episode

1545
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,351
Are some tech issues with this is the worst

1546
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
Probably

1547
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,399
Alex

1548
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
Pretty pissed

1549
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,471
I I do not approve

1550
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,263
If he does not have some sort of

1551
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Performative

1552
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Show

1553
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Or something

1554
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,127
If he's just saying

1555
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,967
This is a ball debriefing two people in my regular Lyle Lovett

1556
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Get the f***

1557
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:03,135
No no I love it

1558
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,695
Here's a ball debriefing for you goodbye sir

1559
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,303
You can forget your turn to buy a round

1560
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,655
So we get another caller in this was interesting

1561
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
He wants

1562
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
To know about Steve's

1563
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Election sting

1564
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
Stop

1565
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Because

1566
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:28,735
Interesting thing that's like now Alex you need to make safe

1567
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Because

1568
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
It's obviously not true

1569
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
Write to you need to

1570
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,903
Put a flag down somewhere

1571
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,463
Is he lying to you or is he wrong

1572
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
That kind of thing

1573
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,583
And of course this we did two more shootings

1574
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Steve pieczenik

1575
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
She did say

1576
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
With certainty that

1577
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
Sting operation with the blocking all that

1578
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
None of that's been verified

1579
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
I mean what's your comment on that

1580
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,175
From everyone's point of view a kind of looks like he is

1581
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Weatherby

1582
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:04,319
We're sure going to find out I mean I'm not wedded to see machete for the Gaston Michelle probably

1583
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,927
50 60 70 * 100 *

1584
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,023
He want to know what show at Noah that was going to happen I didn't want about some other issues

1585
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
And

1586
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,631
That's one of the things that pushed David over the edge

1587
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,239
Unicon

1588
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,311
You went and told you know he's at shouldn't have them on

1589
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,359
Bouncing tell you that one

1590
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
David Babylon

1591
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,479
He shouldn't tell me who that one that had nothing

1592
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
To do

1593
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
With the fact that David

1594
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
Was saying you wanted to quit

1595
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
He was miserable

1596
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Doors open

1597
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,743
So now apparently

1598
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,535
David wanted out so I

1599
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
About the door

1600
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,911
David didn't want me to have Steve pieczenik on anymore which

1601
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Things to do with anything

1602
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,007
He was going to quit

1603
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
Get to walk again to walk in

1604
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,175
Now also I am pointing out that he told me not to have Steve on my show as it is

1605
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,831
Courtesy to a friend

1606
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
Hey so we are getting closer to the relay team starts to get a little bit mad about

1607
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
David Knight

1608
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,303
Giving him editorial advice

1609
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,655
Yeah the Steve pieczenik thing pushed you over the over the adulation told Hulk

1610
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
He didn't do it

1611
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,727
And any any settings

1612
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
What years ago so

1613
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,543
Finally said look dude you want to be here

1614
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
You're free

1615
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,359
I don't like that but I'm not going to sit there

1616
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,407
He's not doing this he's a stand-up guy

1617
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:37,503
Million dollars that guy 10 years come back and every dollar be there

1618
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Straight up

1619
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
True

1620
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Good guy

1621
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,927
So I fired engineer guys

1622
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Is it his way or the highway

1623
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
So

1624
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,583
It's never me telling David what to have on it's the other way around

1625
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,935
Hey you shouldn't cuss on the show

1626
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
You know what he's right

1627
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
And we delay it out

1628
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,591
But he's older than me

1629
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,151
I'm the boss that make sense

1630
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
Yeah David kept telling me how to do my shoes for his health

1631
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:17,183
It has nothing to do with him and see if we chanted fighting even though I brought it up multiple times

1632
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,511
It has nothing to do with him and me fighting even though I am

1633
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
Clearly very angry about it. The square on my

1634
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,239
Radio show

1635
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,543
I told me not to swear on my radio show that I will get

1636
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
Find if I swear on

1637
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Stop station

1638
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,783
Someone someone politely offered me just a little bit of advice as a friend obviously it's

1639
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,879
Sounds like a stand-up guy telling Alex not to have Devon

1640
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
Is a

1641
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,183
Blessing

1642
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:55,583
Expect of somebody who work for me yeah

1643
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
Your passions get the best of you

1644
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,703
Is contingent on you not swearing

1645
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,263
Just seems like a guy who's got your back

1646
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
Huh man

1647
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
Cowboy

1648
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,615
Anyway it wasn't because of Steve though

1649
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
You need to know that

1650
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
My elders but I'm the boss

1651
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,831
Santana last thing I want to do a touch-up on to the network

1652
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695
Matthew Motors to drop it

1653
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:26,559
Swear to God on my children

1654
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
I swear to God on my children Steve pieczenik had nothing to do with this

1655
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,215
And David marched up and down the Halls here saying to quit

1656
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,543
Thermite is gone because of Steve pieczenik don't bring back up

1657
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,383
So is marching up and down the hall saying he was going to quit because

1658
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,687
Nothing to do with it nothing to do with this

1659
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,247
And Alex

1660
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:51,135
Hello little mad people keep bringing up the real answer and it's making it hard for me to continue lying about it

1661
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
But this color didn't

1662
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Say that

1663
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
This colors question was

1664
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
Do you have a comment

1665
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
On that specific piece

1666
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
The b******* that was on your show

1667
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:06,751
Not just Owen show Infowars on Alex's show as well

1668
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,079
That is that is a very fair question

1669
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
For someone to ask

1670
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
Hey

1671
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
You put this out

1672
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,735
It is inaccurate do you have a statement on

1673
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
What you think

1674
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,367
How would you like to clear that up instead out

1675
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:28,767
Which makes you think that thinking about Steve makes him think about David makes me think that maybe

1676
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
Where are my kids lives

1677
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
Strangely enough

1678
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,447
Oh my God I just heard they died after I swear it on their lives

1679
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
I will I will I will eat at night

1680
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,735
I'm a bad guy just hit me and say

1681
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,271
Goodnight to the bad man

1682
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
Alex Jones Batman

1683
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
Not Howard Stern Show we have

1684
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
Fighting on the show

1685
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Fighting with the crew

1686
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
Call her

1687
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Adjust

1688
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
Can't and

1689
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
I just can't handle it

1690
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
Always got to have some drama

1691
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
Steve pieczenik has

1692
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,983
Nothing to do

1693
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
With my decision

1694
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
David Knight saying

1695
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,079
Everyone that would listen to

1696
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
Quit is the reason

1697
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,807
He got what he wanted

1698
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:30,207
Let's go ahead and talk to Jefferson and Virginia Jefferson you're on here welcome

1699
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,743
Wow I feel welcome

1700
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,791
Thank you

1701
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
Subway

1702
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
So you're very respectful

1703
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
Tribute to David nights

1704
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:44,543
90% calls on this year so I would say is not accurate

1705
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,639
I realize now that the thing that I don't want

1706
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,175
People to ask me about

1707
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,831
Is going to be the only thing we talked about on a call-in show I love I love the idea that is the America

1708
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,623
Beacon Journal really getting the pulse

1709
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:04,255
Of the country at the country is conflicted about why you put sucker David

1710
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,071
Except no one appears to be except Alex

1711
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,679
Contradictory reports about that

1712
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
Call God buddy

1713
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,799
I would totally have accepted

1714
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,639
The number of explanations if they seem consistent

1715
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
Say what ya getting overly an insanely defensive over the one that you were telling me for no reason

1716
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,183
No reason why you're feeling in on his show here's what you could do

1717
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,255
Z490 it had nothing to do with it he's just wasn't

1718
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
I'm feeling well

1719
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
I guess what Alex is also a liar

1720
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,143
Could just say he had another heart attack

1721
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,775
Tattoos that would be easy I didn't have a heart attack

1722
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,615
You're a liar by train

1723
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,711
Anyway I was interested after listening to this American Journal

1724
01:13:55,967 --> 01:14:00,831
Call Shore to see how Alex holds up on his own show

1725
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Jefferson

1726
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,671
Hangs out for a little bit boring as hell

1727
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Yeah and then

1728
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
Jon rappoport

1729
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
Takes over for the

1730
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
The the last half-hour

1731
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,815
And Alex

1732
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
Jumps in

1733
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,959
He realizes as soon as he gets on his own show that there were some calls that he didn't take

1734
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,239
On the America

1735
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Journal

1736
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,543
I am so he calls them back

1737
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
Producers called them back

1738
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
I was

1739
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Call by listener

1740
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,807
He was on there reminded me that there's actually a

1741
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
HR 4373

1742
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,743
Self-control. Documentation

1743
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,327
George Soros run media matter that literally are Mercenaries

1744
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
I guess you're very alive

1745
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
Hoping

1746
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,055
I'm guessing that Alex means HR 4373 from the most

1747
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
Recent session of Congress

1748
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,711
HR 4373 from the 2015 2016 session was the end drunk

1749
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
Driving apps

1750
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
2016

1751
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
I'm guessing that

1752
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,343
Oh yeah that's right

1753
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,903
He still doesn't know they start over

1754
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Every Congress

1755
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:15,583
HR 4373 the most recent Congress is a bill called the engineering biology research and development Act of 20

1756
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,679
In December of last year it passed the house and was sent to the Senate

1757
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:25,311
There it was sent to the committee on Commerce science and transportation where no action has been taken on it set

1758
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,847
It's essentially a dead bill

1759
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,967
Even if this Bill had passed it wasn't something they would allow large-scale evil testing on people

1760
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,015
Who's basically a declaration that more branches

1761
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,063
To be given out to engineering biology field

1762
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,135
School of researchers working on those topics

1763
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,719
Sure in case you're curious though the end drunk-driving active 22

1764
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,535
16 didn't even make it out of the house that's not surprising

1765
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,839
That's not surprising everybody loves

1766
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
The drunk driving

1767
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:54,751
The immediate matters is afraid of you looking into these things and finding out these bills that are

1768
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Stalled in

1769
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,567
Committee yeah exist

1770
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,663
Say what I'm going to pretend

1771
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
If only you

1772
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:08,063
I have his heart is David 90/10 to be able to find out

1773
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Whatever

1774
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:15,743
Anyway Alex Resort continuing a lot of the themes from the American Journal like the whole like your

1775
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Placenta will be attack

1776
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
Text by the vaccine door

1777
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,863
Never had it baby again when you take

1778
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,847
Turns out billions of sterilized Millions die slowly

1779
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:37,247
The cover-up and the Nazis called at the cement of blood do now be corrupting Impala any order

1780
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
That sounds

1781
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
Sounds scary

1782
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,695
Can you sue for defamation

1783
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
On the behalf of like

1784
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
Field

1785
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,815
But like

1786
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,863
It could like Pfizer just be like hey

1787
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
I'm going to sue you

1788
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,031
Would like Fox News had to say all those things that they symbolize

1789
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,871
Sidney Powell yeah yeah they had to be like I'm sorry we didn't

1790
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
We lied about that

1791
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,711
Now obviously they're going to continue lying about it but

1792
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,247
Can you do the

1793
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
To Alex I mean nobody

1794
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
Hard

1795
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,343
But I mean it's

1796
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,111
Seems like

1797
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,903
You can't just say

1798
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,695
That accompanies vaccine will

1799
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,255
Force you to never have a baby again

1800
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
Yeah it's

1801
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
Seems it seems like it would be

1802
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,399
Be something that should be actionable in some way but I do I do I don't know what the mechanism for it

1803
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,959
Obviously the vaccine itself cannot

1804
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,007
Sue for defamation

1805
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
And all the people who like really do have some standing

1806
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,127
I don't have the time and our Publix

1807
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,711
Figure yeah yeah so like Bill Gates would have a really tough time

1808
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
Suing Alex

1809
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,015
Even though like

1810
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
I I mean

1811
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:49,439
I mean could the person is actual malice Alex knows the things he saying are not true people who actually create

1812
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
The vaccine

1813
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,279
So conceivably I don't know

1814
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
I Albion

1815
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,095
I don't know no

1816
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
Interested

1817
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,703
Another call from earlier

1818
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
Who's still

1819
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
Waiting to talk to him

1820
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,615
PB in Rhode Island

1821
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
Peanut butter

1822
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,199
You taking my call and

1823
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Can you do

1824
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,247
Thank you brother

1825
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,295
I just got a question for you

1826
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,391
Are the Communist Chinese leaks

1827
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,695
Around the world

1828
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
It was a list of 20

1829
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
United States governors

1830
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,535
On that list

1831
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
I just wanted a lot

1832
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
What you think of that

1833
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,887
And how come it has really

1834
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:37,055
As much traction the media

1835
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
Oh okay maybe maybe

1836
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Because it's not

1837
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
That's not accurate

1838
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,663
Maybe

1839
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
20

1840
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,807
To high does a power half of the governors in this country

1841
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,879
Are Chinese secret agents

1842
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,927
Two Governors heads

1843
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
Successfully become

1844
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Secret agent

1845
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Answer whatever

1846
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:02,399
That's more believable than almost half the entire country is run by Communists secret agents

1847
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
Go to sit in on the American Journal

1848
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,239
So Alex is still optimistic

1849
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,799
This point on the 18th that Trump is

1850
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:13,151
Can seize power feels accidentally that Rodger is still lying to him

1851
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,343
I see all these arrests happening and I see them canceling

1852
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,903
Biden's military briefings

1853
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Tells me

1854
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,863
Rodger Stone

1855
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
They told me

1856
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
4 plus years ago

1857
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
Trump expect

1858
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
And so

1859
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,295
The New World Order

1860
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,391
Yeah I heard this from either Trumper I just

1861
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:02,047
Great 2016

1862
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:13,567
Rodger Stone told me that Trump would overthrow this democratic governments and create a dictatorship so

1863
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,640
I'm looking forward to that I felt like that was the most cons

1864
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Institutional thing I could someone

1865
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:22,016
I mean it's a David like Trump is either when he leaves office

1866
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,552
He's either going to

1867
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
To lose all of his money or he's going to wind up going

1868
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
The jail

1869
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
I don't see him deescalate

1870
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,488
I mean we say that but like

1871
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
Why wouldn't you just beyond

1872
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
The next

1873
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Seasons mask

1874
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
Singer that's like

1875
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:42,240
Why why wouldn't you just reinvent himself as a pop star or something

1876
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:47,872
Directly responsible for the deaths of what's going to wind up being 402 500,000 people

1877
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,712
So I mean obviously I am on your side

1878
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
Speaking from the other end

1879
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Who cares

1880
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
There's a giant

1881
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,600
Portion of the population that doesn't

1882
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,392
Care and give him money

1883
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,672
Astro so like

1884
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:07,840
In America that means there's another chapter as long as as long as he doesn't end

1885
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
Welcome to prison

1886
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,984
Rags to riches to rags to riches or whatever the f***

1887
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
It's not like he hasn't

1888
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,568
Lost a ton of money before that's true

1889
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,408
This point Alex is going to break

1890
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
He comes back

1891
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
Cuz he comes in with some rap music

1892
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
And then gets really weird

1893
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:34,976
Snooze the next hour because there's more coming in I want to really tell you what I think

1894
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
My brain I'm still

1895
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,536
Percolating what's happening

1896
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
But

1897
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,704
Coronavirus

1898
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,520
That's the bottom line

1899
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,872
I talked to really serious people a lot I'm at the synagogue

1900
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,408
And they're all excited

1901
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
And I got to make a run at

1902
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,784
And they're getting

1903
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,856
Facility

1904
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
It really is happening

1905
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,976
And Germany

1906
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
And let's just say this country is fighting for his life right now

1907
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,912
33 days left we should see some big action the next week

1908
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,936
What I'm going to

1909
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
We taking off

1910
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
Gif

1911
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
Classic Alex

1912
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,152
Just come and get it being like I'm not going to cover this story cuz my gut doesn't

1913
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:30,784
I'm going to cover it drums going to make a rat out of

1914
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
How funny

1915
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,136
Alex's just heard this pentagon

1916
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Story

1917
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
What you covers a lil

1918
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,744
Yeah those are axios

1919
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:44,096
Bloomberg all of it acting and transition breathing

1920
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,680
Is not going to concede the military

1921
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,240
So this is kind of what tipped him over the edge

1922
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Agenda like Trump

1923
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,336
Was going to make a run Adams wife sure it's kind of b*******

1924
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
The Pentagon has said that the reason for the halt in transition activities is because many of the staff felt overwhelmed by the demands

1925
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,272
The transition but our quote

1926
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
Still committed

1927
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
To a productive transition

1928
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,112
Phantom power

1929
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,928
You cut off

1930
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,512
A transition I just said of power

1931
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:16,352
I don't want to mislead by adding to the quote

1932
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:21,984
These are the people that they decided to quote to take any until after the holidays because quote

1933
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:26,848
The dod staff working the meetings were overwhelmed by the number of meetings and quote

1934
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
These same

1935
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
Senior leaders needed

1936
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:32,224
To do their day jobs and we're being consumed by transition activity

1937
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:38,112
I'm fairly cynical but the way I see this it's pretty clear the trumps entire team is full of incompetence

1938
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,160
In the field of actually governing

1939
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,280
It's not a surprise that the people he would choose would be the type of folk to be overwhelmed by work

1940
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:50,912
This is still upsetting and horrible and everything but I'm not sure it's proof that Trump has said to use the military

1941
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
Know your power

1942
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,728
When when

1943
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Among officials that Trump has directly appointed is an option

1944
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,360
It's almost always the right

1945
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:02,688
We can't get this s*** done and there's too many meetings

1946
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,992
Oh no

1947
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,576
I could see that yeah I could also see it being a like

1948
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Just

1949
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Almost

1950
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:10,880
Sabotage

1951
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
Petulance kind of thing

1952
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,208
But I don't know if

1953
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,256
I think that's an indication that trumps

1954
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
Can I use the military

1955
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,328
I don't I don't

1956
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,352
I think so but I mean

1957
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,704
Don't make so much sense for them to for the transition team to be like

1958
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,752
Here's the intelligence that we expect

1959
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Do you to give us

1960
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:32,128
And there like we were told not to learn that kind of stuff

1961
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,408
So we

1962
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,480
Yeah running out the clock

1963
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,504
To show that

1964
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,904
We were we were drinking beer for years did nothing we were allowed to act with impunity

1965
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
Yeah

1966
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:50,048
Two possible explanations

1967
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,072
Behind Alex's

1968
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,352
Hahaha

1969
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:56,192
Freaking news the entire Biden family is under house arrest

1970
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:02,592
So Alex has found this new story about the Bay Spring Court

1971
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
And someone

1972
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
Gallon

1973
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
Roberts

1974
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:06,944
Yelling

1975
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
About how

1976
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
We can't we can't do this

1977
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
We can't

1978
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
Trump's cases come to court

1979
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,696
But it looks bad waiting this long before McConnell rollover being shy, agent

1980
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,256
The sprint.com agents

1981
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
That Robert screaming and yelling saint

1982
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,936
Trump martial law

1983
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
We got

1984
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,568
The justice

1985
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
The deposed

1986
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
Chief justice

1987
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,664
We can't do this

1988
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,272
Because if we do screaming at the other justices

1989
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
DeWalt

1990
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,088
The other eight

1991
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
What's in the news now

1992
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
Credible sources

1993
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
Congressman sources

1994
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Chocolate Rain

1995
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
He pistol-whipped

1996
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,400
He he screamed out a ours

1997
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,704
The Bilby Riot Philly

1998
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,520
Blacklivesmatter

1999
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
Abby S1

2000
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,336
So this story isn't true

2001
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,384
Alex just viral online post

2002
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:14,272
About it where Patrick argued at a December 14th meeting of the Texas electors

2003
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,600
That the Supreme Court was too cowardly to deal with the issues in front of them

2004
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
He claimed to have heard a story from a

2005
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,696
Supreme Court Stafford that Justice Roberts

2006
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:25,536
Yelled at fellow judges that they needed to dismiss the Texas Attorney General's case

2007
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,608
Care about Bush versus Gore

2008
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,936
Because there are riots going on in there worth in 2000 Shure

2009
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,728
This man did not hear the story

2010
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,288
Arete it on right-wing extremist

2011
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
How Turner's website

2012
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,408
Someone wrote how Turner anonymously claiming to be Supreme Court

2013
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,736
Stanford told this story which how reported on some

2014
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,552
With absolutely no verification whatsoever

2015
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,624
There's also very strong reasons just on its face

2016
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,904
Did not believe the story

2017
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Like what was supposed

2018
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,464
Did I put it up by Snopes

2019
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
The fact that these

2020
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,304
Supreme Court justices have not met in person for months

2021
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,888
Because of covid-19 there is that there's not really

2022
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,216
A closed-door meeting that this afterlife

2023
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,008
Overheard

2024
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
Yeah but you could almost

2025
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,872
You could almost buy John Roberts just because I'm sure in

2026
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
At least in some small way

2027
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,200
He has to resign

2028
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
Barrett and cabbage

2029
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,808
Because his job used to be so much more solemn

2030
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,088
And like respect

2031
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:24,160
Affected and now with Baron Cavanaugh on there

2032
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,184
Kind of an idiot

2033
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,024
Yeah you know whenever you have notoriously

2034
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,096
On there you know it's like she gives you a gravitas

2035
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
Of the Supreme Court

2036
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Word of like look

2037
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,192
This is what the Supreme Court

2038
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,776
Can do

2039
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,848
And it's like I don't think you're supposed to

2040
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,384
Yeah and I can't think

2041
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,408
Go Kavanaugh without thing

2042
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,968
Squeeze ya ya

2043
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
Yeah

2044
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,016
Yeah for

2045
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:54,112
Poor judge Roberts so sad for him

2046
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
It is going down in history is a moron

2047
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
It's going to be a real bummer

2048
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:02,304
Speaking to people who are going to go down in history as morons and are looked at such now

2049
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,328
David Icke

2050
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Is not on the show

2051
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,888
However

2052
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
His son is

2053
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:13,568
Celtic culture and then like the filmmaker

2054
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
Going to be joining us

2055
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,384
Big breaking news

2056
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,688
Applebee's guys talking about like a marriage

2057
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,248
It seemed like it based on what you do what

2058
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:27,648
To produce

2059
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:31,232
Introducing David Icke The Sun

2060
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
Wow

2061
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,328
Now that is sad

2062
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,120
I would not like to be David

2063
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,144
I could suck

2064
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,704
Used to enjoy it

2065
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,264
So Alex has noticed

2066
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,288
That

2067
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
Stern

2068
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:45,824
Has been doing

2069
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,104
Segments where they make

2070
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Make fun of Alex

2071
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
For a while

2072
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,200
And

2073
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
Lately I guess

2074
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,808
Alex wants to talk about it I don't know

2075
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
This is really a

2076
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
Because they are making fun

2077
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
It's it's

2078
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
It's very clearly box

2079
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,744
Alex might have a different angle.

2080
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,352
Still has a gigantic show number one show on XM

2081
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,912
People with a conservative with a TuneIn

2082
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264
Paw Patrol videos

2083
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,040
I was aghast at the Peachtree Corners Network

2084
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,856
Once a month for years till somebody killed

2085
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,280
Yeah maybe you're wrong

2086
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,304
Oh man

2087
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:45,472
Stern is like suddenly trying to get Infowars messages out on his show by making fun of me and I do

2088
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,776
Don't want to get too much attention all that too

2089
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
F***

2090
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,152
Yeah it's the character of Alex

2091
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,712
Is largely like selling s***

2092
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:02,368
I need to I'd like the way that he brings me more attention yeah

2093
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,696
Actually affect whether or not people believe my b*******

2094
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Butts

2095
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
I don't like half

2096
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,792
Thing to say nice things

2097
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Alex

2098
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,168
Got this idea about Justice John Roberts he's being

2099
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:18,240
The coward and all this is Young Thug closed doors

2100
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,800
I'm actually Alex knows why

2101
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:26,944
Robert's getting a call from holder

2102
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
FabKids

2103
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,856
He's on a very short chain

2104
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,440
And so he's are going we got to do this we got to do this problem

2105
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:44,096
I guess there's blackmail a good thing Alex Arena reportedly there

2106
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,448
Yeah the the Supreme Court notoriously a friend of the Obama Administration

2107
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,032
Americold are really coming

2108
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,176
I mean like what what why why

2109
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,736
What are they doing

2110
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,320
They want to get the individual

2111
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,088
Dual mandate back

2112
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:16,608
Where can I do at this guy's now that we know it

2113
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Kenworth

2114
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,912
Stolen and that's why he's

2115
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
Daughter

2116
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,472
Holder is ready to pull the

2117
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Trigger now

2118
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,312
Yep

2119
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
Assume

2120
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,408
That number things would have gone differently

2121
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,456
If a Eric Holder

2122
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,040
Had to some blackmail on

2123
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:38,624
Suggest that wouldn't hold her lost he also was telling of a look

2124
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,464
I'm planning on losing this one so make it convincing I guess

2125
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,744
She's ridiculous

2126
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,584
So Alex takes more calls and

2127
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,400
The Scholar here wants a civil war

2128
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,448
If they don't do anything about this

2129
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,288
Civil War cuz there's no way we'll survive

2130
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,312
It's not about us

2131
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,872
Future Generations we need to make move now

2132
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,928
Occupation with collaborators so this is a

2133
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,536
Capturing America operations

2134
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,424
His problem seems to be Samantha

2135
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,216
Yeah it sounds like that

2136
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,312
I do not appreciate how casual so many people are with

2137
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
Bandung

2138
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,104
Civil War about

2139
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
It's pretty f***** up I think we need a civil war to talk about in the 90s

2140
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,344
Our lives for the future, we should all just die fighting against

2141
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,880
MedStar fellow-citizens

2142
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
Look

2143
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,744
My problem is terminology

2144
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,864
It's not good it's not a civil war

2145
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,216
It's a recapturing that implies that he's okay with everything but the words

2146
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,496
Pretty much

2147
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,056
So we get to David Icke son and we're not going to let

2148
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,872
This interview

2149
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Cuz it's

2150
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Classical

2151
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:12,320
We started out as a race

2152
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,768
Under the sea

2153
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,936
Basically Thomas Jefferson

2154
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
Wow

2155
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,080
I have a god

2156
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,360
Absolutely

2157
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
Yeah

2158
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:40,992
Thomas Jefferson children

2159
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
TJ

2160
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,832
What my Scorpio Jordan

2161
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,880
And this is Mike down clip

2162
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
Because

2163
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,184
It is a return to form

2164
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,256
It is Alex talkin over you belong to

2165
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,536
SimCity

2166
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:57,888
We haven't heard a good one of those in a while and then I think it just ends perf

2167
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,216
This is this is like a nice little ride

2168
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,032
It's not his best rant over the song but

2169
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,080
Dakota to the at much like the

2170
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,104
The piano and Layla

2171
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,384
Sure great

2172
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
The song

2173
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:34,496
Great Awakening

2174
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:40,896
The only thing you need to know is that this enemy attack is

2175
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:47,296
We

2176
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:54,976
Humanity is Awakening Humanity human destiny

2177
01:34:55,232 --> 01:35:01,376
And as long as you don't make yourself and as long as you know how amazing you are

2178
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:07,776
They created you there's nothing they can do against you

2179
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:14,176
And your life is closer to death every minute every second

2180
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:20,576
Until you're finally gone at the next level and there's eternity and nothing but conscious

2181
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,184
He's about to take over here in just a minute or so

2182
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,488
Inelastic

2183
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
Hello

2184
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,888
Hellboy

2185
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
Man

2186
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,752
Just like

2187
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:42,080
Alex is like an angry Alan Walker

2188
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:48,480
What's lifepics away at that by invited us Saturday

2189
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,320
I just want now to hear Carl Sagan

2190
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,600
Pale blue dot speech

2191
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:59,744
But Over You Belong To The City. Something really great about that

2192
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,120
Song and Alex is weird rambling Trace nuts

2193
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:11,264
What day we will all Fly Away on Saturday

2194
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,312
Weird

2195
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,640
But there's nothing that you can do about it

2196
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,808
It is great at that just like the reality that comes

2197
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
Fishing

2198
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:25,856
Crashing

2199
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,928
The music dies and then she's like

2200
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
Hello

2201
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
Hello

2202
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,352
You going to keep playing you will enter the city I wanted to talk over it

2203
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,120
So great

2204
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
Kilgrave

2205
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,936
I would probably

2206
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:42,496
The Alex talk over that song for like

2207
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,032
An hour on the treadmill

2208
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:47,104
If I k*** it would it would get me there

2209
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,872
Totally

2210
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:52,992
If he was if he was like just going to switch to just Eckhart Tolle tape you up

2211
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,784
But only over music

2212
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,856
Just like a Bangin soundtrack that he talk s*** down

2213
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:04,256
I would listen to that you referenced our last episode the album that of Paul Stanley

2214
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,328
Song introduction

2215
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:12,448
I think it would be awesome if our to record just an hour of freeform

2216
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,520
Improvisational 100% beaches

2217
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,592
Over that sax scicli did it

2218
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:22,432
A little

2219
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,968
I want I want to hear Alex

2220
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,272
Do William Shatner

2221
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,040
Spoken word

2222
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,064
Style album

2223
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,136
Over You Belong To The City the entire that's the entire back

2224
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,928
Dial man just constant

2225
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,488
That would win back a lot of hearts and Minds

2226
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,792
I would win a Grammy

2227
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,376
Open mike eagle

2228
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:44,960
Sloped again what AJ wants up in the top up

2229
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,776
This is going to be his first step to eat.

2230
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,848
He's going to get a

2231
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,408
What it would be called

2232
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Adelaide

2233
01:37:54,432 --> 01:38:00,576
Oscar and star turn the Scanner Darkly

2234
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
They're going to miss steak

2235
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:08,000
His endgame for Avengers endgame and get a retroactive Oscar for that

2236
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,536
And then he's going to get it

2237
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
Tony

2238
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,120
Sure his version of Hamilton

2239
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:17,472
That's great I don't know so true

2240
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,896
I'm Annie gets

2241
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
Send a me

2242
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,968
For that time he was on the

2243
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
Yeah I would give

2244
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,808
Eminem

2245
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,928
So dis

2246
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,232
Somebody's not going to get anywhere as far as the America

2247
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,792
Internal

2248
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,632
I hate to say it cuz I got really excited

2249
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:48,704
Whatever like the David Knight firing happened Ozarka

2250
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Confused

2251
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
And then

2252
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,336
When I learned the next day that Alex was like

2253
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
Really showing some

2254
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:58,432
Go get them yeah.

2255
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Dim

2256
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
Vigor

2257
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,016
I was I was pumped because I

2258
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,064
Like this could be really fun

2259
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088
And instead

2260
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:11,488
You complained about David night and take boring calls like it's not a good show better show with Harrison

2261
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:17,120
Cuz he's boring as hell but you could have somebody who can just be

2262
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,400
A cardboard cutout

2263
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
With the color

2264
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
Right

2265
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:22,240
That's what Washington

2266
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:27,872
That guy has a little bit of competition I'm not saying that he's just a

2267
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:34,272
Yeah he does what he does really well he's like you know the the straight man comedy T-Mobile you think they're doing nothing

2268
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,880
Totem that nothing

2269
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,744
Yeah

2270
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:48,096
We give Lewis half an hour of this entire time was he yelling about

2271
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,656
Licking reports about David Knight totally

2272
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,472
Just because he's Petty

2273
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
In grief

2274
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,336
Hey what's the save face about firing the old graybeard now man

2275
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
I don't know

2276
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:03,968
It said that's weird I still am not convinced 100% it was Steve

2277
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,272
But like his performance make

2278
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,296
Makes me think it was

2279
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,880
Yeah 50/50 now I'm a

2280
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,904
70/30

2281
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,232
Every time he denies it it goes up to

2282
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
10%

2283
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:16,768
You know

2284
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,816
That kind of thing yeah

2285
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,888
Can't be Financial cuz of Alex

2286
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,448
Cuz doing this it would require the crew

2287
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,008
Yeah that would be there for David anyway

2288
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
So I guess

2289
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,312
I mean I guess salary

2290
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
If they wouldn't I was making the blood

2291
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
I don't know

2292
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
I don't trust I don't trust any of this s***

2293
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:38,272
Corsi was whenever we found in the how much f****** money he was making

2294
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,088
Yeah but he had juice yeah that's

2295
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:47,488
Corsi was a name you had a long career there I assume

2296
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,352
Polly got a reprinted myth

2297
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:58,752
Started in 2009 at 5:15 an hour no benefits

2298
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:02,336
Does the soda machine in the breakroom

2299
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,200
Yeah I don't know I would assume

2300
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
So hard to say

2301
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,064
I always think like man that must be getting paid a lot cuz this is

2302
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Is degrading work

2303
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,112
Totally

2304
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,952
I think if you're in you realize you can't go anywhere else

2305
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,816
Sure now David night cuz like we said he had a Newsmax Roan really easily

2306
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,096
Decent contract

2307
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,936
2010/2011 there wasn't anywhere

2308
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:30,240
The David naked baby The Blaze

2309
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,288
But that didn't exist

2310
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,080
He was once he wants he walked in

2311
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
In the door he was stuck for a while

2312
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:39,200
And he's David night so he wasn't going to cause enough problems

2313
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
James elsewhere

2314
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,736
Where to

2315
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,784
Justify a firing until

2316
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
Steve pieczenik says

2317
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,184
Another thing that was bad she can't do this

2318
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,584
This is my final straw it kind of makes it like the last straw for him and Steve was

2319
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,120
Was the Las Vegas shooting

2320
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
After that Steve didn't

2321
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,680
A on Alex's chauffeur

2322
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,472
Quite a y

2323
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,264
It makes you think that maybe Alex

2324
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
Listen to him at that

2325
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,080
Point maybe behind the scenes

2326
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,896
David was the one who was being like look

2327
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,432
This is really f***** up

2328
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,992
M2

2329
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,576
Has told him not to have certain people on in the past I know I heard Alex

2330
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,600
Complain about that

2331
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,392
Play

2332
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,208
And that's why black lives matter May

2333
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,768
Play 10.6 billion dollars

2334
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,048
Fire David Knight

2335
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,608
I think the story will unravel further

2336
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,144
In the coming days

2337
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,472
Theoretically taking a week off

2338
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,544
That leaves us without anything

2339
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,568
For a while so

2340
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:42,176
I was thinking maybe we should do do a project Camelot on Friday maybe

2341
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,968
We'll figure out something

2342
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,504
I'm not going to

2343
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Do it

2344
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,808
David Knight episode

2345
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,624
On Christmas Eve

2346
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
It's not a present

2347
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:56,000
I know that not everybody celebrates all the same holidays but for those who do that would be

2348
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,560
Present

2349
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,864
Not not interested

2350
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,264
But until then we were

2351
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,664
A local charity or bail Fund in your area.

2352
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
How about people

2353
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
Doing God's work

2354
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,856
Emilio Emilio on dzx

2355
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:28,256
The show because of Steve pieczenik I swear I swear I'm not end of the show right now

2356
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,536
Things to do with Steve pieczenik

2357
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,584
Has everything to do with Jordan

2358
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,400
Has been tired for like the last 30 minutes or so

2359
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,448
And he wants to end the show I would like

2360
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:42,848
I would like to show to keep going for another half hour look everybody needs a break

2361
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:46,176
Jordan looks like he's going to have a heart attack he's Ashen

2362
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,760
Anyway finances are tight to do another half hour

2363
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,296
It has nothing to do with me

2364
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:54,112
Holding

2365
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,744
Alexandra Thurston color
