1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nick.com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Worship at the altar of Selena little bit about

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex gold

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,168
Maybe we are Dan what's up

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,056
Apartment here for a bit

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
If it's longer than I've lived in most apartment

10
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:25,504
That's my life that's definitely true for another year and so one of the things

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Is that I'm doing

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,368
To keep things fresh is moving things around

13
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,256
Great way to move without actually move exactly reorganizing some of the room

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
In this

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
It is a type of desired effect

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
It's freshening things up I feel

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,056
I don't know I'm maybe I'm telling myself that I'm not sure

18
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
Don't be mad when you're trying to convince yourself of something that it would be good if you believed in the first place I believe it

19
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
Cecil there you go

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,624
I feel like a it's like

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Alright it's a whole new place

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,584
Vibrates but dead is about the band Beirut

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
So there's a song on the album no no no

24
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Which I haven't listened

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
Listen to it forever and I found again

26
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
The other day it's called Chevrolet

27
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
That well

28
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,224
Call Gibraltar and it has this great upbeat just got this

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Fantastic 1

30
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
What kind of things

31
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
And then it has three huge downbeats that's the repetition

32
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
When you walk

33
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
To this song

34
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,048
Everything is going fine you're just walking along with the beat and every time again

35
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
Get to the three downbeats all the sudden you go

36
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
And then you back and then take another step and keep walking

37
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
It's my favorite song

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
To walk to because

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
You can't stop the

40
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
You can't stop yourself you take a step

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
On the first downbeat

42
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
You kick your foot out

43
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
Can you take another step and you keep going

44
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
I

45
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
I defy you to listen to this song while walking and not do that alright I'll take you up on that challenge I'll let you know

46
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Episode 500 tire world

47
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
I honestly think I'm going to have no trouble not doing that

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,168
Everything's going to be really disappointing for you to learn how it's just you

49
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
You're not now is that

50
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
But this song is too powerful even for you

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Okay we'll see

52
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,272
B b that means there's not

53
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
You might be pleasantly surprised to hear a little harder

54
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Pleasantly surprised to hear this episode

55
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
Something is a little bit weird

56
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,912
Here substantially more stuff to cover

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
Quite frankly because here we are

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
In the

59
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,128
Aftermath of their of course there was a shooting in Highland Park Illinois

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Outside

61
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Chicago on the 4th of July parade

62
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Cancel

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
I kind of

64
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Thought for sure

65
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,184
Alex would do a special report that night because he does that sort of thing

66
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,815
4 weeks since our last special reported up call.

67
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,935
For sure he's going to have probably have

68
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Been too late

69
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
By the time

70
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
The news break

71
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Looking forward to a been on his show

72
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
But that night

73
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,455
He could have picked out some marginalized group to defame with

74
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
You would think

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
You would imagine

76
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
But it never

77
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
It never materialized

78
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,159
That's interesting and so in reality we really just have a little bit of stuff

79
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Before his show on the 4th

80
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
And then the fifth

81
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
We're going to be going over today

82
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,655
I think it will be less interesting than you think

83
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,079

Forget it stays episode here isn't our contacts dropped

103
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
From Today Show

104
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Okay

105
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Alright alright

106
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Okay

107
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
I've honestly

108
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,559
This may be the first time that I've ever wholeheartedly

109
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
No reservation

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Agreed with Alex

111
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
His big boy pants

112
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,031
There is no.

113
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,759
Makes me think of that to a contestant on that season of the Taskmaster with mustache

114
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,695
Its skin tight is the funniest person alive when he tried to fart for roughly

115
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
6 hours

116
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
It just doesn't get too I just don't understand that bad

117
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
So we're going to start out here on the 4th

118
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
You should know about the 4th but I didn't realize

119
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
Until he was a little bit too late is that it's the best

120
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Alex just re-aired

121
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,943
The number of his interviews one of them with dr. zelenko

122
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Who is a recently deceased

123
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Hydrox

124
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Chloroquine and Ivermectin

125
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Covid annihilus guy chair

126
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Another one but

127
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
He did do a little bit up

128
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Brought that was

129
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Fresh contact

130
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,335
Us under 1776

131
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Chess Astorian

132
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,199
Unfortunately has taken control of the major 5

133
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
A shooting the media

134
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Oblate science and medicine says Douglas MacKinnon

135
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
So I'm not sure exactly how you quantify relative amounts of tyranny but I can tell you that certain groups of people

136
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
Definitely aren't living under greater tyranny

137
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
Today than they were in 1776 status

138
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Are all the people Alex pink

139
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Thanks though

140
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
This is an article written by a guy named Douglas

141
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
McKinnon who Alex

142
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
What is discrediting as a historic

143
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Contributor whose also written

144
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
The couple of books

145
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
That are thrillers

146
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Makes me very suspicious

147
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,695
Artist profile on Simon & Schuster's website it says

148
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Ryder

149
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Naughty speechwriter buddyrider

150
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
For both Reagan and h.w. Bush

151
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Quote and afterwards in a joint

152
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Command.

153
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
The Pentagon where you at a top secret government clearance

154
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Alright so

155
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,847
He wrote bedtime stories to help Reagan fall asleep and then we had a fake

156
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Magical power on the Pentagon is with these folks

157
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,343
Like Steve pieczenik were Thrillers to Thrillers of being a right-wing commentator is

158
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
They go together successfully inverted reality and fiction to the point where it makes more sense

159
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
Sense for them to come from a fictional background than it does a reality

160
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
Background right maybe

161
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,007
You can find a load of shity takes on his author page on Fox News

162
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Here's some Choice headlight

How long will I be allowed to remain a Christian three and a half weeks

164
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
It was worth

165
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,111
Why Trump's unconventional approach will help him win big in 2020

166
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Quote milkshake attacks are not funny

167
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
Let's needs to condemn pranks before it's too late

168
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
I told man

169
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
Noticeably absent

170
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,727
On this list about things like the unite the right Rally or anywhere

171
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Concern about groups like a proud boys

172
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Exercising

173
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
You know

174
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Forgot

175
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
He was

176
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
And I will admit

177
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
He is roughly 400 years old

178
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
And he was a super slave

179
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
470

180
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
1876

181
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
So yes

182
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
He does he pursue

183
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Recently lived under less tyranny

184
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Now the clinic 17:7

185
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
He also wrote an editorial a few days back

186
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Real July 4th fireworks

187
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Don't let the left

188
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Cancel Independence Day

189
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
Oh my God we were so close to

190
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,639
She was mixed in like how he thinks that the US needs to have a permanent base on the moon

191
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
Which would be a flagrant violation of International Space tree

192
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
Also in 2016 he had a vision where he claims that the story of the 40 days Jesus spent on Earth

193
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,695
After his resurrection were released

194
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
He seems like a cool guy

195
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,375
Weirdly years back he used a bunch of by lines for the Huffington Post

196
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Little bit different let's drift

197
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,079
He posted up headlines like quote GOP leadership should have condemned the racist joke

198
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,687
Quote why does Washington ignore the ultimate global warming threat

199
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
I'm cold

200
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,295
I am a Conservative Christian who supports gay rights because they're human

201
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Almost like he had a brand adjustment

202
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,487
Anyway he went on Fox News and he had an interview where he was promoting his book

203
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Call the 50

204
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
D6 which apparently is about the quote

205
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
56 Patriot to risk it all

206
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Call the sign the Declaration of Independence

207
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
He told the interviewer quote last July 3rd I wasn't even thinking about writing a book

208
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,407
Then on the 4th of July last year I did a little bit of a video tour on some of the more Liberal site

209
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,295
And on-site after site I saw guest on the left called not only for the cancellation of the 4th of July

210
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
But the cancellation of our founding fathers and the American

211
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Flag

212
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
You can't let that s*** Slide Man bright

213
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,559
Anyway this Fox & Friends interview did was essentially a promotional piece for his book

214
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
And the others sensationalize

215
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
26 17th Avenue

216
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,519
It's more or less just another attempt to drive attention at Book Sales analysis

217
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Who's playing into that

218
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
It is kind of funny

219
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
You know when he was at the house

220
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Kingdom pociask

221
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
The question that he would himself answer later which is why

222
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
You can't ignore climate change

223
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
And then he starts to work for Fox News any realize

224
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
It was a s*** ton of money

225
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
Here's the thing that's kind of bizarre about that happened

226
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
Then post think he was actually not work

227
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
Did they used to have that contributor portal where you could write your own up and you just do whatever the f*** you wanted they were so

228
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
So stupid he was doing

229
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
I don't know

230
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,663
Capacity you didn't have like a freelancer contract I don't think with the post

231
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
I think he was just like

232
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,319
I'll write this huge trying to find his audience anyway it wasn't being a good dude

233
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:45,439
I wasn't having a little bit of it like I listen I'm okay with just a little

234
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Okay

235
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,815
Nike slippers our last run

236
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
On the 4th so much fun if you just did a compilation of Leo zagami

237
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
What time the game on with the champ was right around before

238
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
With his very beautiful wife says they keep talking about I love it

239
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
I smuggled in b y

240
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,207
This is where I really should have figured out that Alex wasn't going to be there for the rest of the episode because

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
This is

242
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Pretty early in a segment

243
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
And if this is usually saved for towards the

244
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Douglas

245
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
Fox & Friends interview

246
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Campos

247
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
Because of the last Stranglehold

248
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Inflation education and Science Center

249
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Not the rebels.

250
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Establishment

251
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
As bad as the tyranny

252
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Boston 1776

253
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
In many ways it's way worse worse

254
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
Because the far-left control over the five

255
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Major megaphones

256
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Our society

257
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
I don't need to read more of that table play the club

258
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Coming up here in just a few minutes but I

259
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Wars cost money

260
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
Prosecute this war

261
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
The New World Order without your support

262
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Don't want to ask you on this shall I force

263
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Pray for me

264
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
Global Awakening

265
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
And to support us financially

266
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,655
Unpopular us into submission

267
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
What sounds right

268
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Especially

269
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Upper-middle-class nouveau-riche

270
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,407
Realize you're going to lose everything in this inflationary New World Order

271
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
Neo-fascists Global governments

272
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
Directing Communists policy to the Grassroots

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
If you will simply realize that

274
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
And say no to it

275
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
The most important way to resist it is financially

276
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Shell products

277
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,887
Enrich your life your immune system

278
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
This is outrageous

279
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
I mean

280
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,055
Sad I didn't notice I had a fee

281
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
Feeling of it that was like this is too early in the segment

282
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
You must be trying to get out of there I really should have

283
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Not listen

284
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,647
Those other interviews

285
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
Yeah you got to give Alex

286
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Bunch of that money

287
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,655
Actually outside of the cravenness of that ad pitch

288
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Clippers schedule

289
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
It's so bizarre how like Alex just weaves his own editorializing into other people's attitude

290
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,711
How quickly he lost interest in this story

291
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,063
I'm weirded out by some people not being like hey man

292
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
I would prefer it if

293
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671
You just quoted me accurately even even people that he's

294
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Ostensibly friends

295
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
I didn't make that up

296
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,863
Yeah makes words in people's mouth

297
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
I guess no one really

298
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
Tell really cares they make up everything anyways and I also don't take him seriously

299
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
I mean it's all all APUSH

300
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
I think what we have

301
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
To do

302
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Is mixed some of the Bill of Rights

303
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Conditional

304
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
But lacking in the sky

305
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
You never have to quarter soldiers

306
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Unless you start talking s***

307
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,255
You know oh we're under more tyranny than we were in 1776 guess what you quarter soldiers now

308
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,167
Like I'm fine with that kind of Bill of Rights I'm sorry would you rather cortical just done

309
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Alex you keep talking about how you have a ranch on internet

310
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Congratulations well done

311
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
So we get to the 5th and now the shooting has happened

312
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
And

313
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Honestly whatever

314
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Expected

315
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,391
I'm just go put my cards out on the table I would have expected this to be his top story

316
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
It definitely is brought up immediately

317
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
But it's not covered that much

318
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
That is the most worrying sign of culture I think I can

319
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Inconceivable

320
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
It really is the most worrying sign that this motherfuker did that s***

321
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
And even Alex Jones is like listen

322
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
We can kind of gloss over this

323
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
This one honestly

324
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,735
It does feel like there's a lot of other things he'd rather talk about does he does deal with his a little bit up front

325
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
Island

326
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Illinois

327
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
July 4th

328
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
Description as all the other Mass shooters

329
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,919
Has now been caught by the police today

330
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Chase

331
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
This is the world we live in ladies and gentlemen

332
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
50

333
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,583
Walked in there to die by the human Smugglers because their families

334
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
The second half of the money

335
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
I was about to contract

336
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Changes

337
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Sure

338
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
To do that

339
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Dumb question that Alex is posing and it's honestly one of the more pathetic attempt I've seen him used to try to deflect

340
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
Attention away from gun related tragedy but I'll bite

341
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
So why is it that people don't want to ban tractor

342
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Your trailers after the

343
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
These migrants were found dead inside

344
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
But people do want to ban guns after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade

345
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,543
That is a really complex and interesting question that I think it'll take just so much time to answer in a lot of his

346
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Historical reference

347
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
This is right

348
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
The truck itself

349
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
To kill those

350
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
They were trapped inside it

351
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,807
But if that's the standard for being used as a weapon

352
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
But I guess that you'd really have to just

353
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
Any enclosed space

354
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:46,303
Yeah prisons would go away real quick to everything you can be locked inside from the outside that's got to go

355
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
You can easily see how this is not really sensible but then again there is a possibility that the government could pass regular

356
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
Racing the manufacturers of these swords

357
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,079
Need to require some kind of Fail-Safe to make sure people are able

358
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Duopa

359
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Open them from the

360
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
The inside maybe that's

361
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
The conversation

362
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,015
Regardless if you assess this is a situation where the truck is the weapon the logic

363
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
End up sprawling it

364
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
The Banning things like

365
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Escape rooms in bank vault

366
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Yeah very bizarre

367
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
The notion that you're trying

368
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
You know honestly I kind of

369
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
I'm warming up

370
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
To the idea

371
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,935
Sure I pick if she want to stay rooms or later someone's going to die

372
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
It's a safety issue

373
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Secondarily

374
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
These need to be Reggie

375
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Authorities were able to locate the people who own

376
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
The truck by a simple check

377
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Roblox

378
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Any sort of

379
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Effort towards furthering gun regulation is the Ulta

380
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,319
For Alex so that's not something that would ever be tolerated with.

381
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,719
Third there are cases of groups of migrants dying in trucks basically every day where is it

382
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
It seems like with mass shootings there are

383
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,631
Migrant deaths are unacceptably frequent but most of them are not in trucks like this

384
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
The reason why it's a

385
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
It's kind of leads to the larger issue and that is that

386
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,895
These people tragically dying in this trailer is not the result of someone having access to a trailer

387
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
It's a symptom of a bigger problem with witch

388
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
Stupid why someone would be in that trailer to begin with

389
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Alex loves

390
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
Talk about how the border is white and how Biden

391
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Just letting everyone in

392
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
Which really raises the question of why people would

393
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Subject themselves

394
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
Was being smuggled in a super dangerous trailer

395
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Putting themselves at this kind of risk if they could just walk right into the

396
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Alex wants to make immigration more

397
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Difficult and make border enforcement more cruel

398
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Which will have the effect

399
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,592
Making people more open to using Desperate Measures to enter the country

400
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,920
It does makes tragedies like this one more likely to happen in the

401
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
The future

402
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Similarly he wants there to be no gun regulation at all and wants everyone to be able to have all the guns they want which will have the effect of

403
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Making people

404
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
More people like this shooter on Monday heavily-armed

405
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Did able to keep carry out

406
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Horrible Act

407
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
The future

408
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,328
The situations that Alex is trying to compare a hero

409
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
Analogous at all

410
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Dinos

411
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,192
He just doesn't really have much of a leg to stand on in this

412
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
Situation so he's grasping at

413
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Straz

414
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
His tragic

415
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,896
Situation to another horrific situation

416
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
That his policies

417
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Hurst preferred policies

418
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Time towards

419
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Increasing

420
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
He can go f*** himself

421
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Yeah I mean I just don't

422
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
No I I don't know if there is any reason to

423
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
To talk

424
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,584
I mean I don't know if there's any reason to have any arguments about guns

425
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
It's already everybody

426
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Reset everything

427
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
We're just going to watch people die

428
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
And nobody's going to do anything

429
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
I get where you're coming from

430
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
But I think that kind of apathy

431
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
He is

432
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Something you got to fight again

433
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Because

434
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
You could end up

435
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:50,368
Stopping yourself from putting effort into things bitter that they could have a positive outcome

436
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
I mean

437
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
I think

438
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,744
Problems arise whenever it is some

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Thing that no individual can any longer do any

440
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
Nothing about no individual can make a

441
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Yeah no matter how much you organize what it

442
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,056
Requires is other people organizing another people organizing and so on

443
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
And it's it never never

444
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Can end

445
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
Yeah I mean I think

446
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
I think

447
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
Tigger something to that in the in the sense that

448
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,064
Communal organization is important but

449
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Still

450
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Individuals can make differences even Within

451
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:28,000
The communal need for organization and is much as like

452
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
You know it seems

453
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Assertive

454
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
I don't know dismissive to be like every dollar counts

455
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Or whatever

456
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
It does

457
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Realist

458
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Sickly if

459
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
A lot of people

460
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
Throwing a dollar to something are absolutely

461
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
I don't know

462
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
I do I get where you're coming from I get what you're saying but it also I think I'm not being clear at all

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,368
And that's because I'm being incredibly cynical and

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Run me I mean more

465
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
It is

466
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Not

467
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Valuable to discuss

468
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Guns

469
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
It is valuable to

470
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
To discuss organization

471
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:10,752
That could be fair there's no point in arguing with anyone about how do guns Bluff

472
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
At no point is a math is done

473
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
I need to organize people and not talk

474
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
People with an

475
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
About that

476
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
I think that

477
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,368
That's something I could be more on board with I think that's a different point than you were making but I

478
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
Because I left out the part that actually makes sense

479
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,816
That's a good important part to add whenever your sense of usually powerful

480
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
So Alex really just kind of

481
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Talk mostly about the Border

482
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
And what have you

483
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
I saw a headline

484
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
All yesterday

485
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
UN agency

486
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
List

487
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,760
Texas Mexico border as the most dangerous

488
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
Land Crossing in the world they give us at istics in fact

489
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
It's twice as dangerous as the next

490
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Most dangerous

491
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Border crossing

492
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
In Arizona

493
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
USA

494
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,192
Thousand-Year on both sides

495
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Not even a radar blip

496
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,872
So Alex is actually talking about a correct headline here but he's making stuff

497
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
The International Organization for migration runs a project called The Missing migraine

498
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
Prince project that it seeks to quantify and record the number of deaths and disappearances there are among migrants around the world

499
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
They recently released their numbers are 2021 and the u.s. Mexico border was the most deadly and most dangerous

500
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Border crossing in the world

501
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Wake up call

502
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,704
And also seems to run counter to Alex's ideas about a wide-open border

503
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Alex is making up the detective

504
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,848
Cuz Mexico border is the most dangerous in the arizona-mexico Border came in second

505
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,248
The organization didn't report numbers like that and this is just something Alex's to make him sound like he knows more about the

506
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Tiffany actually does

507
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Cuz he doesn't know.

508
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
He's also completely fabricating the tens of thousands

509
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Number

510
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
This report with cheese

511
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Exciting says

512
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
The fakir document

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Quote 1238 deaths during migration in the Americas

514
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
In 2021

515
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,936
With at least 728 of those deaths

516
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Occurring on

517
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
The US Mexico border

518
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Far Cry 4

519
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
From 10,000

520
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Yes yes

521
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
This is a really good

522
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
Cut-and-dry example of the way Alex report stories

523
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,040
There may be a kernel of something correct in that this report does

524
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Exist but the details you selling the audio

525
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,464
Answer generally things but he's just making up to paint the picture he wants them to accept his real

526
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Others

527
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
No a reason

528
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Why and that's

529
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
Because you want to

530
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
To create this thing

531
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
That is

532
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Over the

533
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Top bad

534
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
What attention away from

535
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
The thing

536
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
That just happened that is

537
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Traumatizing

538
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
People

539
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
And is threatening to your world tonight

540
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Is obviously buddy

541
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Thousands dead a year on both sides

542
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Not even a radar blip

543
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,024
We have less than 150 people killed in shootings

544
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
6 killed in Illinois

545
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
21 killed in Uvalde

546
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
And the media will the hell out of it and their will

547
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Moore capito

548
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
Highly suggestible individuals on soccer

549
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
Individual

550
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
The shooter

551
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Bobby

552
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
YouTube channel

553
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,032
I watched all 26 videos on again

554
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,384
Talk about depressing and scary I sent links to my producers

555
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
7 a.m. this morning

556
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,112
What's on the big stream Lee hunting iWatch

557
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Every one of them

558
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
He did animations about mass shooting in schools

559
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
Screaming in blood

560
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,472
He made music videos about the same thing he even got into the school

561
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,056
They went two years ago and shot a music video

562
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Inside of it

563
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
So you can see here one of the main reasons that Alex tries to paint the picture that this report was saying the tens of thousands of people are dying a year

564
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,368
We're on the border on both sides because it's a way that he can minimize the impact of mass shootings

565
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
The reality is the mass shootings are bad and happened a lot and are such a problem that you have to lie about something else to make

566
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
Make them seem insignificant in comparison

567
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
You know it

568
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,448
It's kind of an interesting mirror image of all too often

569
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
End the conversation

570
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
On the

571
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Is it Spectrum

572
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Afghan rice

573
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
B or a political rights

574
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Insofar as most people are like

575
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Listen

576
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
There problems with the Democrats

577
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
We need to choose the lesser of two evils

578
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Where is on the right

579
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,856
The strategy is ignore the lesser of two evils

580
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
You need to be

581
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Be way more afraid of 10,000

582
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
People dying on the border

583
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
Ignore this lesser of two evils you know

584
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
Whatever that is I don't even know about that

585
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
You know it's a fascinating mirror

586
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
That's interesting

587
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,848
I was struck by Alex's insistence that he watched all of the guys videos as you were as well

588
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
He seems to really want him

589
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Make clear which is weird that he watch them

590
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
I don't know why

591
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
Well if you say I watched all of them

592
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Multiple times

593
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
Especially if you're Alex

594
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Hideout

595
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,720
I also think I think I know what your video from a school that he's talking

596
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
I'm about

597
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
I don't think I was actually wasn't actually the school lockers on one side of the wall and then

598
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
The lockers are a door

599
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
I don't think this is a real classroom

600
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
I personally did not watch all of this guy's content with the amount of a lead me to the conclusion that

601
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
I was unprepared to make a conclusion about what was going on here

602
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:19,136
There may be a fair amount of content available from this guy but it may be awhile until there's any

603
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Motivated him to do this

604
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
And I don't believe that watching a few YouTube videos

605
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Which I don't even try

606
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
But Alex did

607
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Would make anything

608
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
More clear

609
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
I don't trust Alex

610
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Is assessment on this

611
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
I don't really trust

612
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
My own assessment

613
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
Because I don't really have a concrete one about

614
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
What this guy was

615
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
All about I mean from

616
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
All that I've learned

617
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Just discovered what a Nazi

618
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Cat-boy was

619
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,576
Was so go from the way late

620
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
To the party oh well

621
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Congratulations and welcome

622
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
A really nice to not be there for a while

623
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Just watch all of these videos

624
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Now we have

625
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,912
At least 50 video gorilla van I watched over

626
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Repeatedly

627
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
I should have

628
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
Call krunal download a man but it was 4th of July

629
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Bastion before I finished

630
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
They did get some of the bad ones

631
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
I'm sure somebody

632
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
I really don't want to subject you to that

633
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Launching

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Music

635
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Pretty pretty good beats

636
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
I hate you

637
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
I hate you so much

638
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,216
Deep in the bottom of my soul I want to

639
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Hates it's really weird

640
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,640
I mean extra do you know what that echoes

641
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Who's awesome

642
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,688
F****** Buckley

643
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Now

644
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
It's a good pizza

645
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Of the videos that good beats that Alex is talking about

646
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,976
That's very strange repeatedly

647
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:04,864
You trying to get out of that really don't know I did for clues that have man I don't know

648
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
My first thought is good he goes to a dark place but

649
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
Maybe posted my first thoughts go to dark places to eat

650
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
Maybe he just really really did like those because

651
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
You got to rise above

652
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
Do you see a lot of pee

653
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
People pointing a lot of things

654
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
The shooting and Alex doesn't want to do that

655
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
The left trying to blame the right wing

656
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
Probably trying to find the last one

657
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
On the Sky last night

658
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
Hours watching the sickening videos

659
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
The haunting videos

660
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Music videos

661
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Shark videos

662
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Pieces

663
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
Most of them about shooting up schools

664
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Tell you that

665
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Just like all the other shootings

666
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
And it's 100% driven

667
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,624
Machine the mass shootings the media that being hyped up

668
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
So what was the other two hours

669
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Spent four hours plus

670
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
2 hours was it 12 hours

671
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
I mean that was whenever he played

672
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
The Beats for his kids

673
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
Oh sure you want to give them

674
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
Kind of like a good

675
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,728
Basis for hip hop music and really kind of

676
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
What's the temperature appear above

677
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
The Fray and acting like he's critical of

678
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,432
Fingers but you have to understand his ideology

679
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,992
Exist in a certain way if you do

680
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
Florida State vs devils

681
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,672
He believes that the Democratic Party in the last as a whole or either knowingly working for Satan or has been tricked into work

682
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
For Satan

683
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
Or possibly somewhere possessed by literal.

684
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,120
Twenty says in the last

685
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
He's blaming the left

686
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
But doing so in a way where you can pretend that there's a larger point

687
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
To what he's saying

688
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,408
It's essentially an analog for most of his career attempting to appear to be above the left-right Paradigm when in reality

689
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,552
He's just a far-right extremists in his only complaint is about the right-wing is that he thinks that they're secretly part of the left

690
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Yeah I mean

691
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Well and the way

692
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
He treats

693
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,976
Oh the left is blaming the right in the right is blaming the left you can

694
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
Argue that but what he's really trying to say is that

695
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
The left

696
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,912
Is blaming the right because they're demonic monsters and the right

697
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Needs

698
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
To calm it down for a little bit

699
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,800
They can't be blaming people just yet we got it

700
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Listen I understand guys

701
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384
Nice but right now is not

702
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
The time

703
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Corvette

704
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
The the left is blaming the right

705
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,344
And the right who are blaming the laughter actually secretly also the lab

706
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
No one is where I am

707
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Right

708
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,048
So this about 284 the shooting for now

709
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
This individual

710
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Bobby cremins how is the definition

711
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Also like to dress up

712
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,384
Adjust likely white supremacist shooter follow the same Mo in Buffalo New York

713
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Constant Contact

714
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
With a retired

715
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Federal

716
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
I will bet you my bottom

717
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Dollar

718
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
Individual was under cultural massman

719
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Control

720
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Direct Control

721
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
I mean

722
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
Pretty easy back to it probably

723
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Hello

724
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
It's impossible for him to prove anything

725
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Yep

726
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
So like I said this is about it

727
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
He said his piece

728
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
He watched these videos

729
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
It's demonic

730
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,784
He's a weird dude who dresses up like in this bih

731
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Probably mind control right with his bottom buck

732
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
But it's not going all the way in

733
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,232
This is a false flag is just saying that the kid was mind-controlled by the

734
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
The government's so it's not a false

735
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Black

736
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,864
Probably mine controls for sure by the

737
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,216
The culture video games and music and what have you

738
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,568
Yeah and then the media covering mass shootings makes

739
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Copycat

740
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
Effect and undermine control

741
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
Probably on psych meds MKUltra

742
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,272
So where we are

743
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
And then the rest of the show for a bit

744
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Takes a different time

745
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:15,744
The most dangerous land in the world is the texas-mexico Border

746
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
Iran is involved in this later

747
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
I'll cover this coming up

748
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,640
Whole string of Texas counties and towns are going to declare an emergency of invasion

749
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
And total collapse and call for aid from the states

750
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Federal government

751
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,648
Texas is in a total

752
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
And complete

753
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
Emergency

754
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Holyshit

755
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
Wow

756
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Yep

757
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
I mean you know it

758
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Is

759
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
So unsurprising to go races

760
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
So quick

761
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Boys a distraction technique

762
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,872
Pop this point in the episode I had high hopes

763
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah

764
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:10,528
I had some kind of hope that this is Alex reporting incorrectly

765
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,136
Somebody who was actually trying to declare immigration and invasion

766
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
So it's somebody who's going to try and

767
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Declare immigration innovation

768
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
That sounds right

769
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
View imagine

770
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Really f***** up

771
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,264
Pick up clear how f***** up it was until the interview at the end of the show actually happen

772
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
I don't even know if that's true anymore

773
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:38,944
You know now that my imagination includes that there is no bottom I really don't know if they can

774
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Can surprise me with anything at this point

775
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
What if you walk in

776
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Nuc

777
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
The Crawling chaos

778
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
As a thought

779
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
That would Shock Me

780
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,792
I mean I think that would have to write

781
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
Hotep might be the crawling chaos I can't remember

782
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,568
Sure sure but I'm fairly certain that it's a magically impossible for me to not feel fear around that

783
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
Yeah I guess so probably

784
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Sewing

785
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
I'm going to cover this press conference about calling immigration and invasion

786
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,624
And today on the War Room 3 p.m. and they have the press conference

787
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
Owen Shroyer will be carrying

788
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
The Press

789
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
Conference live 3 p.m. central

790
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,840
Infowars.com show

791
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
Feed section

792
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
A band

793
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
. video

794
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Hope you'll share it

795
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
Protections just calling for Aid

796
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
Listen to WhatsApp

797
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Texas

798
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Harold's the collapse

799
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Are the United States in the design

800
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Speaking of that

801
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
I want to talk to Lester Zoe very very clear with you right now

802
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Wow

803
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,560
I told you three months ago

804
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,400
Save money by buying food then because food prices

805
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,080
I only

806
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,992
100 different types of high-quality nutritious food

807
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
Ready to ship you at the lowest price you're going to find

808
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
So I need to point out that Alex wasn't selling his emergency food buckets as way to save on grocery bills in the near future

809
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,096
Yeah I doubt that using all kinds of fear base sheet to sell this food

810
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
The sales pitch was awesome that your family was going to starve to death because there would be no food so you needed to buy this stuff

811
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
I was going to make some things

812
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
A bit more expensive

813
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:46,176
He said he would barbecue your ass that was why you were buying food because in 10 days

814
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
Alex himself would eat you or with covid there would only be Lone Survivor

815
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,648
There's nobody to man the grocery store

816
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,256
Stop the dollar is going to disappear in all of its value and then

817
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:05,888
You can't buy food in 15 days

818
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:10,496
He wasn't liked by storable food because milk is going to go up by a dollar and a half per gallon

819
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Yeah

820
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,568
I don't know I find this disingenuous

821
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
So there was

822
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
A shooting

823
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
At a parade

824
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Fourth of July parade

825
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
There were

826
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
Lot of people hurt

827
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Here's how Alex

828
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Going to spend some

829
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,184
Spend two segments

830
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Right here

831
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
In my

832
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,008
This is mainstream government reports and mainstream news articles

833
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,128
Created synthetic aliens

834
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,736
Any plant or animal DNA but out of nanotech

835
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Alright

836
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
So that's where that's where we're at we're going to complain

837
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,440
About immigration being an invasion and we're going to approve the scientists are inventing aliens

838
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Wow

839
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,560
I really think this would make Infowars listeners change

840
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
The channel

841
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,192
I don't know I don't think they're looking for

842
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
I mean especially if there's

843
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Mass shooting

844
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,336
I think they go they're looking for him to make up some conspiracies

845
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Do agree

846
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
But I also think that maybe

847
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Here

848
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,040
Is keenly aware that there's enough of an Internet economy for that that he doesn't

849
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Neither need to do that

850
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
Entirely possible it might be a risk that he doesn't

851
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,488
Feel like he needs to make look big swings on these kinds of things come back

852
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,816
Tomorrow it makes him a little more interesting

853
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,632
To prove that aliens are being made by

854
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:46,496
Possible especially for people who want to pretend that mass shootings are no big deal I don't even know why we're talking

855
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
There is another reason he's doing this no guy that later

856
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Nanobots

857
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
New

858
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,991
A multi-faceted thousand prong

859
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Genomic

860
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
Cultural biomedical

861
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
But it's all been

862
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
And blueprinted

863
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
In WarGames

864
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
The Rockefeller Foundation by the Carnegie endowment

865
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,703
By the United Nations by John Hopkins and that's how we know all this

866
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
I didn't just say oh look these documents what's happening

867
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,479
Whole shows in in writing books and making films

868
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
I mean no exaggeration

869
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
And then I bought YouTube

870
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,511
1670 years ago

871
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,959
I was only around for another year-and-a-half after that

872
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,263
The last time I checked Google video

873
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
You had 80

874
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Million views on

875
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,303
Thousand years left there killing knows we haven't posted man on video for free

876
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
If you don't watch it you're going to want to throw up in your mouth

877
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Song quotes

878
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
Reparations

879
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
And then after that

880
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
2000

881
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
8 9 10 11

882
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
There are hours of videos that we played here

883
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,759
Where I specifically read from operation lockstep Rockefeller Foundation

884
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,831
I specifically read from the UN document in stay

885
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:52,447
So you spent nine hours talking about how full of s*** endgame is and how most of the quotes Alex covers in that are actually fake

886
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
They're just from like memes

887
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Some stuff

888
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:59,871
Watching it does make me want to throw up in my mouth though but mostly because of Alex is overwrought narration

889
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
Invoice

890
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
God it's embarrassing it's really really annoy

891
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,087
So Alex gets no respect for me for predictions he's made because he ignores all the millions of things that he's gotten

892
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Totally wrong

893
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:17,023
If I predicted that every team was going to win the Superbowl I don't get to pretend that I'm some kind of a profit because I only

894
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,631
Acknowledge the one prediction that was correct well you bullshittin

895
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
So I mean

896
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
Also operation lockstep still isn't a real thing and Alex has never and will never recover the documents he bases his

897
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Is conspiracies on in any detail because if

898
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
If you did so

899
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,015
Those conspiracies would collapse immediately

900
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,623
The only thing that's holding them together is the audience not realizing that the

901
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
Actual documents don't prove anything

902
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,999
And the actual basis for the conspiracy is just stuff Alex

903
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
Is making up something's better service political

904
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
And ideological world

905
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,911
Because of that flimsy Foundation Alex

906
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
Keep moving

907
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
And never spend time covering anything a death sentence

908
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
That would instantly reveal that there

909
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
He's no doubt

910
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
Anything that he's talking about

911
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Destroy the illusion that he's created

912
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Before the audience

913
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Yeah

914
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,087
It would be a surprise and I think what would be really interesting about it if he

915
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
He did just come out and say I was making all of it up

916
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
Is how no one would believe

917
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
I honestly don't think

918
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
He thinks he's making me say there was a come-to-jesus moment 44

919
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
For this fella on the road to Damascus or whatever

920
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
And he's like listen I got to come clean

921
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,567
I don't think anybody would believe him I don't think he's messy

922
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
Sunseri to believing is b*******

923
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Not anymore

924
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
No I don't

925
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,735
I don't think so and I bet

926
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,807
To some degree it wouldn't have mattered early

927
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Yeah

928
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
Yeah it's a bummer

929
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
But damn probably true

930
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
How to spell right

931
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
That it's suspicious

932
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
It is kind of suspicious

933
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,519
Keep us off of the general internet

934
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
Absolutely

935
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
It's not the way jump set

936
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Jones is one of them

937
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
That's how he knows this he's wisdom

938
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,119
Such a crutch and then that is so wrong because I want you

939
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,703
I know what I know

940
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,519
You can do read operation lockstep for 2011

941
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
You can read sparse 20-25 20:28

942
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
2018

943
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:44,479
So this is exactly the kind of criticism valix that I hope to eradicate from people's by

944
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,551
This is the kind of criticism

945
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,879
But Alex is more than willing to bring up an address on his show

946
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:57,791
Reason is because in order for someone to be making this criticism of Alex already bought in

947
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,119
On the underlying premise that Alex has been right about every

948
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:07,007
In order to argue that he was secretly be a globalist or some kind of limited hangout or a Honeypot

949
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:13,407
You have to already accept Alex's framing of the world and by doing so you've lost any ability to actually make any mean

950
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Leaving for critique

951
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Of what he does

952
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
Alex is not right about things

953
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
He's a malicious liar who primarily just makes things up

954
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
The most work he does about the stories he covers is to skim a headline and then improvise an explanation for how that fits into his world

955
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,863
His understanding of the primary sources he relies on to build upset worldview is horrific

956
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,679
And none of the documents he uses for his points say

957
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
What he claims they do

958
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Alex hasn't just been wrong about stuff

959
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,359
Is almost meaningless to quibble about rightness or wrongness because

960
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,687
Really the criticism of Alex that's most cutting is that

961
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
He's just making up most of the stuff you talk about

962
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
And none of it has

963
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
Any value to anyone in the audience

964
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:58,207
He's welcome to surprise me and actually address our criticisms of him on his show but mysteriously that never happened

965
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
He's going to do it

966
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
So weird for the pettiest man in the world to never bring up there's a podcast that's release 700 Appisodes of the past 5

967
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
Five years but he's a liar and a piece of s***

968
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,775
Response time pushing back into meaningless Anonymous criticism that

969
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
Even if the audience accepted it

970
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Filippou's Alex

971
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Genius

972
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,663
And his conspiracy worldview

973
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
So weird

974
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
I think it's an ironic

975
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
Point to say it

976
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,063
Suspicious that I'm right all the

977
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,879
Have you know cuz yeah

978
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Yeah

979
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Yeah it.

980
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,791
Not usually on my suspicions of somebody who's right all the time in the sense that it like

981
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
Oh you must have inside information

982
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
So much as I am like

983
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
You're probably making this up

984
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,775
That's why you're right all the time because you have control over what happens in this narrative

985
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
Yes of course you're right more than

986
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,711
Find address conspiracies about his conspiracy

987
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:58,111
It's still within the game I mean what's what's funny about it is that Hebrew

988
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Breaks into the consciousness

989
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:05,023
Almost like what he's created a completely fictional world and sometimes it'll touch

990
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,327
The real world just the slightest little bit

991
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
And then people be like holyshit he's right

992
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Pittsburgh world is in the real world you know

993
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
And it's just that it's just a tap

994
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
So really his pettiness

995
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
Next

996
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
It is

997
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
I want

998
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
Really stress out Patty he is

999
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Because

1000
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
What are you talkin about the scientist

1001
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Creating aliens

1002
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
I don't do there's another reason he was covering this

1003
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Alright

1004
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,559
Budget some really big news right now nowhere to take calls starting at

1005
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
Bottom of the hour

1006
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
For special guests joined this on the

1007
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
Decoration emergency about to be made

1008
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
Texas

1009
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
Collapse

1010
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Interesting declaration

1011
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
God works in mysterious ways

1012
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,295
And what they make fun of me about today people discover Dimitri tomorrow

1013
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
So

1014
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:05,951
Is big news is that someone posted a little clip of him and was going around on Twitter

1015
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,047
I was about him to clarinet dependents from the globalist and Evelyn

1016
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
That's the big news is that he went viral on Twitter

1017
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:24,127
That was not as good as Bill Pullman's but as good as some of the other ones

1018
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,711
Declared its independence

1019
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
She cleared a lot of Independence

1020
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Right

1021
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,599
It's a shower I was thinking I was like

1022
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,159
Him declaring his independence from the globalist

1023
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,743
Is essentially like if you have a job

1024
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
And you quit that job

1025
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
Emerald alright

1026
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
I guess you quit that job

1027
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,679
And then like 2 months later you quit that job again

1028
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,263
No not at all but I've had a lot of time to think about it

1029
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
I've decided to quit it better this

1030
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:04,063
I know I do I said I had a better the second time

1031
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
Years later you're all old men just walking in going like

1032
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,559
Now that was matching the job doesn't exist

1033
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,191
The situation wherein with Alex declared as a dependent

1034
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
I appreciate people who are late-to-the-party who like

1035
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,103
Post clips of him declaring his independence demonberry share

1036
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
Because

1037
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,735
It is novel and its you know if you don't listen to show you don't know that he does this s*** all the time

1038
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,855
Everybody likes a good Independence Day speech. So anyway

1039
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,927
Yes he has had this video the people have been making

1040
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,999
In front of and so he's going to spend

1041
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
And two segments.

1042
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,607
Talking about how aliens are being created by scientists

1043
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:54,751
Because the video went around making fun of him you know there was a shooting at a Fourth of July parade

1044
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
No

1045
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
But that didn't happen

1046
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,967
To him specifically of your time my guy

1047
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Buddy's time

1048
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,319
Alex's kind of

1049
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Complaining about the

1050
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
This video going around but

1051
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Is this is this I mean

1052
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,303
Gleefully right like look at how to look at how much people are talking about me right

1053
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,655
He did specifically for attachment

1054
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
Just go viral ridiculous

1055
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,311
It's on MSNBC it's on CNN it's on ABC

1056
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
It's on Newsweek it wasn't

1057
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,455
Alex Jones claims aliens want to make humans into cyborgs slaves the same

1058
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,927
Walking into one of his advance and he's walking bipedally

1059
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,231
All of his minions

1060
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
To the VR goggles

1061
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
Those are cyborg slaves St

1062
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Sounds right

1063
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
People love that turn my coin but

1064
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
It's a metaphor

1065
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
What's happening

1066
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,711
Okay there's a picture of Mark Zuckerberg in a bunch people as we are goggles on

1067
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
Cool he's walking bipedal

1068
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
You understand

1069
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Okay

1070
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,879
So today when they took off the goggles and got up

1071
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,183
No they had to stay down while Satan

1072
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,511
Sure and then Satan left and then they could stand up

1073
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
On the VR goggles where to Blind them

1074
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
From Satan's beautiful ladies Lucifer obvious

1075
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
The lightbringer

1076
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
Aha

1077
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Solo

1078
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,775
Alex plays of the clip of himself

1079
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
And then

1080
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
This is this is shocking

1081
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
Because

1082
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
If you listen to this carefully

1083
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
He's essentially saying

1084
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
I believe everything

1085
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
In this clip

1086
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Literally

1087
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:49,695
They took me out of contacts I believe all of this

1088
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Here is the

1089
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Forklift out of context

1090
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
Ida Claire

1091
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
This July 4th 2022

1092
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,519
Let me a Declaration of Independence against the Alien Force

1093
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,871
On this planet today Waging War against humans and our biology

1094
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,455
And our very future that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us

1095
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
And force-feed

1096
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
Minorities is left

1097
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
To merge with a I can

1098
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,855
Computers and become

1099
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,903
Cyborg slaves of Satan

1100
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
3 days out of 7 days

1101
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Lithia Springs

1102
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
Most of messages are anti-human

1103
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,751
Ninja babies

1104
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,407
All of this is to get you off balance and not standing up for what you are who you are

1105
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
At the base of it is the transhuman

1106
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,575
Play few minutes in contacts is I didn't go right into the top of alien I'm talking about

1107
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,415
Sing I believe the Bible

1108
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,975
Prediction the mark of the beast all this that it is a

1109
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Dimensional attack

1110
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
AAA

1111
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
Collaboration collaborator human

1112
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
Places by the

1113
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
Principalities this Earth

1114
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
To build the advanced technology they need to that estate

1115
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,111
Boys

1116
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
I'm exposing Illuminati called

1117
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
That's not why

1118
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
I think he's saying that

1119
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,559
They're making fun of me in this out of context

1120
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Text clip

1121
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
So

1122
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,679
I'm going to play the full clip and then they'll be convinced that I'm correct

1123
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
Right

1124
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Yeah

1125
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Look I mean like

1126
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Reasons date like

1127
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,103
You know you can play with something sticking out of context

1128
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
Because that thing that is out of context does not

1129
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:52,319
Accurately represent what it is that you're trying to just communicate but not only do I believe

1130
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,599
Everything

1131
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:58,463
Want you to know that it's crazier than you think

1132
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,023
I want you to know that I believe

1133
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
The demons

1134
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
We're stranded here

1135
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
You

1136
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Think you can make

1137
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Make fun of me

1138
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
For me telling you only a small bit of the truth

1139
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Come on man

1140
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,079
Come on man you don't eat

1141
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,663
No has his one of his trademark

1142
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Sure of

1143
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
Headlines

1144
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,319
But he thinks proves his point

1145
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
And it does not come out

1146
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
2

1147
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
Just less than a hill of beans

1148
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,791
A few minutes on that I took it out of context

1149
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,655
Real quick he did play his full clip

1150
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Independence Day

1151
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
Flying Saucer is over

1152
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
New York City blowing up

1153
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
Show me show you an Eaton

1154
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
Anybody watching some TV or anybody to radios and record this

1155
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,415
You do look up every one of these articles and you can see it for yourself what I was talking about

1156
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,487
Here's one

1157
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,303
This is the main religion

1158
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,119
Eclipse

1159
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
Looking forward to the end of humanity

1160
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,519
Covid-19 Shuttlesworth failed species must merge with machines

1161
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:23,199
That's not too accurate depiction of that article at all

1162
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
Is greater technology and health availability

1163
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
Stuff like this

1164
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
Eaton company

1165
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
Inequality is going to be addressed

1166
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
Certain things and maybe

1167
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
This idea that we have

1168
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,887
Of overcoming disease and

1169
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,679
Some ideas about transhumanism

1170
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,287
Maybe a lot of these ideas are actually not as good as some people

1171
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,847
That's actually what the iPad is about but Alex

1172
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
Might as well be about this before we just

1173
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:03,135
Craving sugar nobody Alex loves the title though and it works for him and it's all that he remembers so horror

1174
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
Yep

1175
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
Then there's more

1176
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
Nbcnews

1177
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
James Lovelock says

1178
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,679
Nbcnews I shouldn't be no more humans humans will be obsolete the future you will accept

1179
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
From Human to cyborg are you willing to augment your body

1180
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
Why the future doesn't need us wire

1181
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:28,479
Cyborg thing is just this guy James Lovelock who

1182
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,551
A guy was like

1183
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Yeah

1184
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,623
It doesn't mean that cyborgs are going to replace

1185
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
And then

1186
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:42,559
Is that article from Wired Magazine but he lies about all the f****** time

1187
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,935
He believes that it is just be the whole article is just the small Passage

1188
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,495
Where are the author Bill Joy quotes

1189
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
The Unabomber

1190
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,103
That is what he has taken away from entire article

1191
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
Yeah

1192
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Boo

1193
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
You know I would

1194
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,223
Wonder how Bill Joy feels knowing that

1195
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,783
He was the mouthpiece for the plan of the globalist

1196
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
Does he ever think

1197
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Wait

1198
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
I think I might have been you

1199
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,743
You know it I don't know who Alex Byram

1200
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
Please do Alex Ybarra

1201
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
Yet so there's another clip

1202
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Alien life-forms artificial genetic code

1203
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
That's what I was talking about

1204
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
So this is just an article from 2014 and it's not about a life form in the way Alex makes it seem

1205
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:33,247
Researchers just a fused a modified E.coli with some lab-made nucleotides

1206
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,807
It's and put in

1207
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
We're able to

1208
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
MoviePass down when the bacteria reproduce

1209
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
That's really cool

1210
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,071
And this is a clear example of Alex just having headlines that he likes to go back to because if it weren't

1211
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,959
He wouldn't use this catchy headline and he would know that 2017 the same team had a

1212
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,751
Further breakthrough where they quote

1213
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,847
Announced that they're semi-synthetic strain of E coli is the first

1214
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:03,711
They both contain the unnatural basis and its DNA and use the bases

1215
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
Instruct cells to make a new Pro

1216
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:11,391
Or he would know that last year there was another paper published about this ongoing research that's been headed up by doctor

1217
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Floyd

1218
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
Romesburg

1219
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:19,583
I also know anything about this story but the headline works for it so he just incorporates whatever he wanted his story

1220
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
Basically always do

1221
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,911
Yeah I mean

1222
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,055
If you wanted to pull that story out and not be like all there's a newer alien life-form and more be like

1223
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
Has anybody ever

1224
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Red

1225
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
Any story where

1226
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,223
People played God before just throwing this out here

1227
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,575
Has anybody ever read a story where people played God before how did that turn out

1228
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
They played God

1229
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:48,511
What happened next I will get to that a couple a couple of citations down the road

1230
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,327
But here here's the next one that Alex is misrepresenting

1231
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,911
NASA watch Space Station

1232
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
T

1233
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,335
It's got dozens

1234
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Uplink

1235
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,295
Systems on the space stations in zero gravity

1236
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
So there's a story from last March about four strains of bacteria that were found on the International Space Station inside

1237
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,511
Three of which were previously unknown

1238
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Science

1239
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
NASA's most certainly not yawning about this because the idea that bacteria could survive in space Hazmat

1240
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
Vacations in terms of being able to grow food in space

1241
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
Which would be a

1242
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:39,199
These are not newly-created life-forms and it's pretty well understood that these bacteria came from Earth

1243
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,039
And we're introduced to the space station by way of a passenger or cargo

1244
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:48,927
Research on them found that they were genetically and taxonomically similar to bacteria commonly found on rice

1245
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,767
Put this in perspective so here's an expert who spoke to

1246
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
The guardian

1247
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:59,423
In every spoon of soil or stool sample there hundreds of undescribed microbial species

1248
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,495
I'm sure they're still hundreds or even

1249
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
Sons of less characterized

1250
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,591
Maybe even unknown microorganisms

1251
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
Aboard the ISS

1252
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,711
It could be a game-changer in terms of space food

1253
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,783
Could be something that's kind of interesting but not really that big

1254
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,391
Whatever the case reality has no connection to what Alex is talking about here

1255
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
This is nonsense

1256
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Right

1257
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
Aliens

1258
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
In zero gravity

1259
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Don't think

1260
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,839
Can do that

1261
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Spy

1262
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
I mean mainly linguist

1263
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Reasons

1264
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:39,615
Place where reasonable people can disagree

1265
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:45,759
If we're arguing

1266
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,343
Look there's a lot of headlines that Alex Reid

1267
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,671
Any number of them are kind of like I don't even know what this has to do with n

1268
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
Anythink Wright

1269
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,535
Right but there was one other one that I think is worth

1270
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,327
Mentioning because I

1271
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,399
Maybe it's closest he gets to anything that seems like

1272
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Huh

1273
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
Alright

1274
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,519
Okay maybe we're in messy territory

1275
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,871
Wooden robot

1276
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
The credit chain reaction

1277
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,967
Chain Reaction hell yeah

1278
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,551
Eating a real headline but it's not really accurate to the story

1279
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
These robots can't reproduce

1280
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Per se

1281
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,439
But they can Clump things together

1282
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,487
So these are basically

1283
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,279
Clumps of frog stem cells

1284
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,607
Switch can respond to certain stimuli that researchers give

1285
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
According to one scientist quote

1286
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
At the moment they don't do much

1287
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,751
We can get them to walk across the

1288
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,871
Petri dish very very slowly or Swim through watery fluid very very slowly

1289
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,967
There's nothing going on inside at there's no brain there's no digestive

1290
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,807
However researchers have noted that they have a tendency to

1291
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
To Clump things

1292
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,671
Together when they were introduced into their petri dish and the idea came up to

1293
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,487
To see if they would do that with other frog stem cells

1294
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:04,351
The scientists added some new frogs that sells empty xenobots as they're called

1295
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Peed in fact

1296
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
Text Club these cells together

1297
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
Effectively creating a new xenobot

1298
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,823
This is not what Alex is describing he's playing fast and loose with a headline but

1299
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,175
I would maybe say that we shouldn't go too much further down this week

1300
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:24,575
Hahaha you talk about that play God

1301
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Ticket happen

1302
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,623
They're out to

1303
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,159
I was reading an article about this

1304
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
Beneficial outcomes

1305
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
Stat that are kind of in

1306
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Christine about this

1307
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
In terms of

1308
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
Being able

1309
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
2

1310
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:43,263
No I deliver medicine places in your body that number of applications

1311
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Guys

1312
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:53,247
Come on, read a book the most responsible scientists to be doing is listen we're not crazy

1313
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
I'm sure they're not

1314
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Crazy

1315
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Who said we were crazy

1316
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,679
This is where I

1317
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
Kind of

1318
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
Drop into Alex head

1319
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,311
That place where reality and fiction

1320
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,663
Yeah just a little bit just a little bit when you got frogs

1321
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,223
Stem cells but somehow are pushing

1322
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,783
Other frogs

1323
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,135
Like that's to be like good guys this is fine now

1324
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,999
Qualitrol I back you know I have dabbled in writing

1325
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,303
And and you know

1326
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,447
Maybe sometimes a lot of those books about people playing God or more about how the writer needs Mara detention

1327
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,031
You know and I playing God and then everything being

1328
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
Find us

1329
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
Sounds like the narrative tension is like

1330
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
What the f*** did we ever need God for

1331
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,711
Let's find out how to kill that guy

1332
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Now you got some

1333
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,903
Yeah I agree with you that if you're ever making a story and it involves playing God it has to go wrong

1334
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,767
There is no reason backstory

1335
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:15,167
Happily ever after short story

1336
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
I loved it

1337
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,263
So we get back to the shooting now because Alex has got a piece of news

1338
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,543
Is that makes this able to

1339
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Recover right

1340
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,895
Well they just had a press conference forget the video for you in the next hour

1341
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
Highland Park Illinois

1342
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,599
Shot and killed six people into another 60

1343
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,951
Do photos and videos him dressed like a woman

1344
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Folks this

1345
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Yes

1346
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Mars Attacks

1347
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:49,215
Actually aliens

1348
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
It's a camouflage

1349
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
Joan

1350
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
Alien alien to humanity

1351
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
The future alien

1352
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
Everything we stand

1353
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,479
This is legitimately nuts

1354
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:04,063
This is the last segment of the second hour and Alex's done almost

1355
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
0 coverage of the shooting

1356
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Happy Fourth of July parade

1357
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:13,023
He's a giant deal and honestly it's essentially a meatball just right over the plate for him to cover

1358
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,583
This is an attack on the founding of America

1359
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,631
The target reveals the motive

1360
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
Tommy's I can't handle

1361
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,471
Did the Red White and Blue

1362
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,823
This basically writes itself for him to the point where it's suspicious how little he's talking

1363
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,383
I'm about it instead to spend a half an hour

1364
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,223
Complaining about how someone tweeted out a video of him declaring independence from the Devil

1365
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,807
But now Alex brings the shooting back up because he has a hook

1366
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,159
He's heard of a way to make this a part of his transphobia so it

1367
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,719
It's not quite so threatening for him to talk about it

1368
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,047
He can always fall back on the meeting was boilerplate Minecon

1369
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,095
Control psych meds type talking points

1370
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
That only goes so far

1371
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
Particularly in relation

1372
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
Do an event like that

1373
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,239
Has all of these other Dynamics

1374
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:00,127
By making this about his abject hatred of trans people Alex more comfortably talk about this shooting

1375
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,991
Because he can scapegoated vulnerable Community instead of dealing with the actual issues that underlie the

1376
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
This tragedy

1377
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,087
In reality it's believed that the shooter dressed as a woman

1378
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,647
As a disguise to help him escape the scene

1379
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Particularly because he has

1380
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,999
Notable facial and neck tattoos which

1381
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,559
Could be covered up with a wig scarf and makeup

1382
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,631
He was not dressed as a woman he was arrested as Alex

1383
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Proclaiming

1384
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
This is just

1385
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,519
Alex trying to turn this into a trance phobia narrative which you notice he also did

1386
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,335
In the immediate aftermath of

1387
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,383
Yeah yeah I saw that

1388
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
I saw that one

1389
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
That that one going around

1390
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
And a couple of times

1391
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,783
I really do believe if somebody said that to my face I would

1392
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Attack them

1393
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,599
Like my my I was twitching

1394
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
Listening to him talk

1395
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
But I will viciously attack you if you say that to my phone

1396
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,743
It's not enough fun

1397
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Nope

1398
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:57,215
Before YouTube

1399
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Kaiser Dino

1400
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,407
The New World Order Kool-Aid

1401
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,455
110 percent

1402
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,343
As well alright return your phone calls

1403
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:19,743
Wow it's so weird how I look bring that up earlier when he's bragging about all the videos multiple times

1404
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:26,399
I was just a vague accusation of demons and devils

1405
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:31,263
But now that he's heard that cremo dressed as a woman to obscure his identity escaping this

1406
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,335
I guess I remembered all those videos you totally watch

1407
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,503
I know that this is a lie because I went to such an aggressive transfer but if he had watched videos where cremo was dressed as a woman

1408
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:46,879
That would be the only thing he talked about for the first hour of the show we would have gotten a report that

1409
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:52,255
Yeah yeah that would have been our special report imagine that it did probably would have if he had that hook

1410
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
Earlier on

1411
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
Yep it's

1412
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
It's disgusting

1413
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Alex

1414
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,679
Yeah it is clearly lying

1415
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
Wendy says he watched all these videos you know that's a lie you already know this makes it even more of a lot

1416
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,639
Compound lie on top of

1417
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,759
I got one guy who's a weirdo

1418
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,807
Thanks for all the products

1419
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Hi Steve.

1420
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,135
I've got Alexa Breeze and all my rooms

1421
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
And my wife

1422

Tickets a little sapling that's not running so

1423
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Used to that now

1424
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,815
Thanks for keeping us all there

1425
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,447
I guess the one thing I want to bring up is

1426
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Have you ever heard of Jonathan kleck

1427
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
No

San Antonio

1429
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
And he's got a line on all this stuff

1430
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
And I got to tell you he's really

1431
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Help me

1432
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,719

Do

1438
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
He's got the

1439
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
Is that the explanation for all this

1440
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Transgender

1441

But he's not he's not one of these the end is coming

1446
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,791
He's really well we got to make the end happen no he's the end is here

1447
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
It's already it's already have

1448
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,655
Before the fire

1449
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,471
I watched a little bit of one of his videos

1450
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
Mostly to figure out if this was him calling into Alta showed the same voice

1451
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,711
But I didn't see him doing some really weird

1452
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,551
Attempted linguistic breakdown of Bible verses

1453
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:57,951
I also noticed that his YouTube videos have about like a hundred views on them so small audience

1454
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,303
100 more time

1455
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
Conceivably

1456
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,447
It's from looking at his website that this is

1457
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,007
Something good know that doesn't sound like

1458
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,823
We better be super nice

1459
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
Two people that doesn't sound right

1460
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,687
So yeah we get another call and this guy wants to

1461
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Talk

1462
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
National Mall

1463
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,623
Hey John. I got three main points I want to make one about my route Mount Rushmore Trump

1464
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
And Flack

1465
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,951
Mount Rushmore

1466
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
Radio cultural Warfare

1467
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,839
W look at Mount Rushmore we have the founding fathers Jefferson so on so forth

1468
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,887
You're right now putting up

1469
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,935
Crazy Horse monument

1470
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
Crazy Horse

1471
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
Monument Lewis

1472
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
Time in

1473
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
Scalping

1474
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
The 7th

1475
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,639
Calvary you know when we fought in that region

1476
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,199
It's a cultural war and then left is

1477
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
Winning the culture War

1478
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:59,135
If that's the cultural War that's being taught here then yeah this guy is making it pretty clear that his side is just in favor of a homogeneous

1479
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Play culture

1480
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,975
I sure hope the other side is winning the culture War

1481
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,327
Also Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln are definitely not founding fathers

1482
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
Forgotten Boardwalk

1483
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
The Crazy Horse Memorial is not like a plan to destroy Mount Rushmore it's

1484
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,359
Just another Monument nearby the people have been complaining about for decades

1485
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,919
I went to Mount Rushmore when I was like

1486
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:26,271
13 and I remember people complaining about the Crazy Horse Memorial then

1487
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:31,135
They started working on it in 1948 and it's not even close to being done

1488
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,415
And it's just this

1489
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,719
Perfect Grist for the racist Mill

1490
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
Yep they're just

1491
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
Cannot

1492
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,303
Stop complaining about this

1493
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,095
It's a good indicator of

1494
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Whose socks

1495
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,263
If you complain about the crazy horse motor maybe that's not true generally of somebody who wants to Finn

1496
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
You should genocide

1497
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,127
It's impressive that the heads are carved in Fairmount

1498
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,663
You know Mount Rushmore

1499
01:13:54,175 --> 01:14:00,063
But I really want them exploded I really want that blown up I've been there

1500
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,671
I mean what are we doing what are we doing

1501
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,999
What I say that it's impressive I kind of mean that it was

1502
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:13,375
Always ago technology was different back then they manage to do that

1503
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
That's pretty cool that is

1504
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,959
Physically impressive

1505
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Seat of

1506
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Again

1507
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
Genocide

1508
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
It is a

1509
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
Part of the genocide

1510
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,943
Bolton Roosevelt on there because he made national parks

1511
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
Okay hold on now

1512
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
This guy

1513
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,903
As a story

1514
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
Makes me sad

1515
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,279
Hey Alex first-time caller Kelly appreciate what you do listen

1516
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,071
12 years ago I was driving down the street

1517
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,143
A block down the street and there was a mailbox

1518
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,167
And it

1519
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:51,263
Said it was an inside job and infowars.com

1520
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,639
That's all it took

1521
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,199
Everything you've done in the studio

1522
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
Where work

1523
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
Everyday

1524
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Batman

1525
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,599
Put that sticker on that

1526
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,903
Mailbox for a reason

1527
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
And it woke me up

1528
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,975
Took me 12 years

1529
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
2

1530
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Trying to get the balls

1531
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
To go down there and introduce myself

1532
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
It's kind of weird

1533
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
Situation

1534
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
And

1535
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
The neighbor it's not a city block

1536
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
Long story short

1537
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
Dr. sebi diet

1538
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
On Thursday

1539
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
And it was

1540
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Fourth of July weekend

1541
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,135
I'm going to go down to introduce myself

1542
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
Balls with down there banging on the door

1543
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
The most old man thing I can

1544
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,791
Probably ever stay in my life at 48 years old

1545
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Young girl answer the door I said hello is your dad

1546
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
Today my name is Bill

1547
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
I live down the street

1548
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,079
And your mailbox woke me up 12 years ago and I want to thank you for that

1549
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,663
And he lit up like it was the 4th of July

1550
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
It was

1551
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,967
It was Fourth of July weekend

1552
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
It really was

1553
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
God is like this ad

1554
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Man that is

1555
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
There should be more

1556
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,023
I was thinking about some of the Dynamics at play here and I think I would be kind of a

1557
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
Afraid

1558
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
Knock on the door too because I know he's

1559
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:26,495
Supercar and probably a little bit suspicious of people

1560
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,311
Little girl answer the door I'd be like Jesus Christ Don't Shoot Me

1561
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,711
Cute little girl I'm cool yeah I'm just here to talk to your dad I got my hands over my head

1562
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:42,111
Christ yeah sticker so no 12 years of my life has been stolen from me

1563
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,719
I saw a sticker it blew my mind and now I put up with this nonsense how am I God

1564
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,791
Yep I would love to just put another sticker over there

1565
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,583
Alex Jones

1566
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
Mayonnaise

1567
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,191
If that story had ended with them kind of like

1568
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
And we

1569
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
When on a date

1570
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:04,127
I mean if they did more than the guy the guy brings him some Infowars

1571
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
T-shirts

1572
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
And they're good friends they're happy now

1573
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,343
Rear weirdos together and I guess

1574
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
This will one day be a terrorist cell

1575
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
That's a long it takes

1576
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
So

1577
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
We get

1578
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,279
To this interview

1579
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,351
But Alex has with this guy

1580
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
Who is

1581
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,543
They're trying to declare a Mexico border invasion

1582
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
Okay

1583
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,639
I'm interested in this

1584
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,663
Because I think

1585
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
There would be

1586
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,735
Be unintended consequences if you do

1587
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,039
Declared that Texas was fully under invasion

1588
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,159
I would assume so so I'm interested to see where this goes

1589
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Man

1590
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,815
I don't know if you are pretty late here's introduction

1591
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:59,423
Houlihan is a great lawyer and a patriot

1592
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
Who's been spearheading

1593
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,055
County Citizens defending freedom

1594
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,735
Will be covering an area that would shorten the war I'm coming out at 3 p.m. central

1595
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,319
Genesis an incredible time right now

1596
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,855
So in addition to being

1597
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:24,255
Involved in this raises nonsense Jonathan Houlihan also recently was trying to run for the 8th District housing

1598
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
Texas

1599
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,095
Which he lost the GOP Primary for back in March

1600
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,655
He came in third

1601
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,727
So I guess he lost

1602
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,263
Trying to stoke fear

1603
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:39,359
I Am brand immigrants as Invaders because I guess he's

1604
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Think that's politic

1605
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Yeah I mean

1606
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,991
What else would it be it wouldn't be some sort of like

1607
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Almost

1608
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
Bland office

1609
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
First job where you kind of put

1610
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Together an idea of what it is that

1611
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
People generally have a

1612
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,463
Taste for and then trying

1613
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
Improve their lives

1614
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Addison and all of that stuff

1615
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,351
So I I didn't know what to

1616
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Expect

1617
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
From this

1618
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,703
In terms of like what

1619
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,287
Nails pretty

1620
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,871
Ongoing for 4 months and months worth of organized

1621
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,175
To declare an emergency

1622
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
Retiring invasion

1623
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,015
Enforce the Texas governor to act

1624
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,063
Governor Abbott

1625
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
Situation

1626
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,135
Article Article 4

1627
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,439
Section 7 as the commander-in-chief

1628
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,255
Allows him to repel invasion

1629
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,791
And under the Federal Constitution

01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,007
A free Funnel Vision and guarantee the Republic

1633
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,799
That's not happening

1634
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:44,127
So you also see the states have War

1635
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Douching

1636
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,943
Content Clause 3

1637
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,575
This legitimately

1638
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,855
Seems like what he's

1639
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:58,719
Suggesting is like a military repulsion believe that he suggested that

1640
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
Texas.

1641
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:02,303
Declare war on immigrants

1642
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,143
We're going to pretend that that doesn't mean all of next

1643
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
And

1644
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
Mexican people living in Texas

1645
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,824
Because here is the problem while there's a lot of problem there's so many problems

1646
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
Everything he saying is a problem

1647
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,176
But then when they

1648
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
They get into talking about like

1649
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,016
What is this look like

1650
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
In concept

1651
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,624
You really start to get the Japanese internment

1652
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
No not that one

1653
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
I'd also like to see the

1654
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,256
The state of Texas enter into more

1655
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,584
Contacts

1656
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Arizona

1657
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
And then really

1658
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,288
Security standpoint have the state with people act

1659
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
For those that don't know this

1660
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,528
The UN says most dangerous sport in the world

1661
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,832
Totally collapse

1662
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:00,672
U.s. garbage lost control by Design I mean it's on record

1663
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,488
It's got to be. We can't just keep waiting for Washington

1664
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,816
What do you think David should do in this emergency If he if he doesn't try

1665
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
I think Abbott should

1666
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,704
Do what Dwight D Eisenhower did in the 1950

1667
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
And deploy

1668
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,848
The entire Texas National Guard and entering a contacts with other states

1669
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,920
And shut down the Border completely

1670
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
Not to put too fine a point on this

1671
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,856
And I'm very sorry to use this language but it over what was called operation wet back

1672
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,160
They're ran from 1953 to 90

1673
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
B54

1674
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,744
And like the deportations of between 100,000

1675
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,792
Two up to over a million people

1676
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:40,096
Many of whom were US citizens of Mexico

1677
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,448
It's a historic shame on our policy decisions as a country

1678
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:51,104
This guy thinks that this is a good model for what we should be doing it's a really f***** up sign and it's indicative of

1679
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
But what he actually walks

1680
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:56,480
Yeah he doesn't want increased border stability or security

1681
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,040
Deport masses of non-white

1682
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
People

1683
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:06,720
Howard Hughes Eisenhower for inspiration on this one what's your ex

1684
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,768
Actually doing is using Andrew Jackson

1685
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,304
A inspiration on this one

1686
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,656
Well f*** it and you're actually using etc etc the

1687
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
The point being

1688
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
It is the trailer f***

1689
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
It's and it's

1690
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,520
Expulsion

1691
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:24,896
Of indiscriminate people you've just deemed to not be American

1692
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,944
Is a racist Witch Hunt

1693
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:33,344
Scale kind of things that has ripples

1694
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,648
Through generations generational wealth

1695
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,928
Is disrupted and

1696
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
No people are still feeling the effects

1697
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,536
Pics of that fat Mass deportation

1698
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:47,936
I even now 70 years later and he wants to do this again

1699
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
F*** this dude

1700
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Alex

1701
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:55,872
For being in any way sympathy and promoting it

1702
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Goddamn

1703
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,968
I was going to say that's such a stain on our f******

1704
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
King history

1705
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,552
85% of history books pretend it never happened

1706
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Now it's probably doesn't know about it I believe it

1707
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:13,280
I want more clip here and this is where I just said I hate all of these people there was a deeply traumatic

1708
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,816
Mass shooting

1709
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
That just happened that your

1710
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,448
Giving short shrift to. Even really talking about except

1711
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
A little bit later you're able

1712
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,800
To turn it into part of your transphobic narratives

1713
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,152
Really just new welfare

1714
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,432
People be brainwashing

1715
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:39,648
And I have a swim bothers me the most about is the smile on their face

1716
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,744
I bet they know that there's a rule of laws broken down there's no consequence

1717
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,728
A literally former Soros group

1718
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
I can find few things

1719
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,104
It's more distasteful than the idea that this guy

1720
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
Running

1721
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,736
Alex opening spearheading isn't kind of like in charge

1722
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,272
He clarifies that he's not really

1723
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,344
Like the one in charge sure he's clearly

1724
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,440
Charged enough that he's the person who goes on it forwards talk about this so

1725
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
That's something

1726
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,768
Part of his motivation

1727
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:21,632
Is he feels like immigrants are smiling at him because they're getting away with

1728
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:25,472
Floating or flaunting their beating over the law

1729
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
That's in your head my man

1730
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,616
This is this is a product of your hatred of them

1731
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
You need to

1732
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,688
You need to do some

1733
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,224
I'm looking in the mirror

1734
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Cuz this sucks

1735
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,528
I just I mean

1736
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
That's

1737
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,392
That is such a penny capsulation of like

1738
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,440
It's 2020

1739
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
What are we doing

1740
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,280
What is how is this possible

1741
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
That

1742
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,584
People are trapped

1743
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,632
In the f****** Civil War

1744
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,680
How is it possible that we're just

1745
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,728
Said that there is so many people who are like

1746
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:01,312
Oh because magic Sky God you can't control your life

1747
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Sing to me cuz they don't think they lost

1748
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,088
Yeah man I got us

1749
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,904
I'm glad that Monday's episode was fun

1750
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
Because

1751
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,744
There are few things that I can think of that are less fun than this

1752
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,024
Yeah

1753
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,328
Obviously it didn't come up as much

1754
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,144
As you might've expected but our hearts

1755
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,168
Go out everybody

1756
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,960
In Highland Park

1757
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,496
And yeah

1758
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,520
A lot of people

1759
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:35,104
Who live in Chicago have connections to Highland Park so

1760
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,408
There's obviously is very close to home

1761
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
Although it is

1762
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
It is not Chicago proper

1763
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
As we

1764
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Point out

1765
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
Everybody who

1766
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
News from suburbs

1767
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
It it

1768
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,696
Just just awful and

1769
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,792
At the time they were recording this I don't feel like

1770
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
And I really know enough

1771
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
About it to really

1772
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,680
Fully discuss it so on sublevels

1773
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
It's maybe

1774
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,288
A blessing that Alex doesn't talk about it that much

1775
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
But what does talk about suck

1776
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,944
Navel gazing about how he went viral

1777
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,248
Nonsense about his

1778
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Ideas about alien life forms

1779
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
And then some of the most

1780
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
Troubling

1781
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,392
Commentary

1782
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,440
About immigration I've heard on his show

1783
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,976
You know I think

1784
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
Something that's really scary about that is the way that

1785
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,072
His

1786
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
Stuff is

1787
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,936
Treated as pseudo mainstream to

1788
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
Folks like Tucker

1789
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:35,776
I'm like

1790
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,056
Whereas

1791
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:40,384
Maybe in the past you could look at some of the stuff you saying

1792
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
It's insulated to this

1793
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,456
It's not

1794
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
So much of that anymore

1795
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:45,760
And

1796
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
The ability

1797
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
For this

1798
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,856
To pick

1799
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
Piggyback from Alex

1800
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
To some other platform

1801
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,280
To get behind this idea of declaring an invasion

1802
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Or something

1803
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,608
Like it's really really scary

1804
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,144
And I don't like what

1805
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
If

1806
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:08,032
Trump announces his candidacy in 2016 on the

1807
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
Unjust

1808
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,920
Hey might as well have been like Eisenhower was

1809
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,480
My greatest idea for the borders

1810
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:20,320
Hey that's I'm not mean we forgot about that

1811
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
Declare on the

1812
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,392
No that's truly there TJ

1813
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,488
