1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I'm sweating

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
College fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
Everybody want to acknowledge my time dance around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,704
How do you feel about steroids in baseball do you think they should be in the Hall of Fame

9
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
I don't know I don't know really have a strong position on that I think I don't like people using steroid

10
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,688
Frozen competition but I also have no

11
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
I like I don't know how to root again

12
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Not really I think it's up to the people who are in charge of the the hall today or or the ml

13
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,232
I'll be your whatever if they want to allow people to juice Shack

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
Then go for

15
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
Bad end up with people like

16
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:43,936
Yeah yeah you'd end up with a lot of people are really severely harmed by that. Not a good thing to do

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Are you going to let him in the hall or not

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
That's up to you guys

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,944
Are you paying attention already and I don't know anything

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Oh that's right well it's continuing on his way there right now gotten worse

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Colin Firth

22
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208
Series to be taken away is Rob Manfred the

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Commissioner is

24
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Calling the trophy

25
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Which has his

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Name on it

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Little piece of metal

28
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
These it bad

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
Yeah that that does sound pretty pretty shity I don't really have any strong feelings about that

30
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm torn because like Mike's or chaotic side is like let him cheat

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
Fox Sports leadership

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,832
If you're crafty enough to get away with cheating go for it

33
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,672
But then the other part of me knows that's no way for like it sets a bad precedent

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Like the cycle

35
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Books with motors on their bike

36
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
Thanks for the Tour de France that would probably be

37
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
That does have very serious effect on their the purity of the turf as they say

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,008
So yeah I don't know I think if it were up to me if I were in

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Charge

40
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
That's a good question

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I would not be alone allowed

42
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,456
But I will never be in that position where I'll have any impact on that

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Don't really have a strong

44
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
Cut to the world being Stranger than 30 years and you're the commission

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Nirvana

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
That's insane

47
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
I could see it happening

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
Give me a possible series of events that would lead to reply

49
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
On LinkedIn or

50
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Monster.com

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
I don't know much about this stuff but Jordan I do know a lot about alley

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
Alex Jones

53
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,808
So today during what I thought we would do here on this this here Wednesday episode is

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
I think that our last episode was a little too much

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
Murder murder murder a lot of Alex calling for

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
The Cambridge professor

57
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
You killed herself

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,216
He needs to go on timeout pre-emptive true-crime

59
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,592
True Crime that happened yeah

60
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,408
Present-day has so much stuff going on in ad that you feel

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Really felt like you need to keep up with what Alex is doing and I still do believe that

62
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
I need to put them in time out

63
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Please so we needed to take we didn't take it

64
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Excursion off

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Do something completely different and you know it could have been you know could have been a Bill Cooper episode

66
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
Feel like that's too close

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Waiting for you to be like a John Wayne Gacy was on Bill Cooper

68
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Let's talk about that no no no

69
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,031
That seems to close so I even go far afield of that

70
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
And so I've got some

71
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Something fun

72
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,455
I think good to go over moments

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735

00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391

If you're out there listening

00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,095
These gents do I you do that by going to a website knowledge buy.com there's a button

98
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631

99
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Thank you it would be lovely

100
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
So Jordan

101
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
2017

102
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
We were young

103
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
Well you know that's

104
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,663
When we restart the podcast in January of 2017

105
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
And then a little ways down the road

106
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
We started doing Project Camelot ever

107
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Episodes because I wanted to tell you about the wonderful world of wacky space

108
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
World for a Hoosier.

109
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
It has become less bar

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
As we learn more things about

111
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,007
The sorts of people that hang around it get interviewed by Kerry Cassidy and

112
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
Some of the opinions that carry May herself hold and

113
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
Cameron juice it's really weird

114
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Maybe not hate

115
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
But have weird feelings about

116
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
It became less vaunted it's just this

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,583
Become a thing where I want to do more space weirdo episodes in Project Camelot but also it really

118
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
Only makes sense really when Mark Richards

119
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
Who is a guy who's the murderer

120
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
You guys a space captain

121
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:17,503
It's a living spaceship Minerva flies around with and Raptors will kill you for Chaka

122
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,903
Occasionally

123
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Brought up once and then disappear

124
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
So I was thinking about it and like

125
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
When we started this it was

126
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
In 2017 also is when we first had our Project Camelot think

127
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
And it was not a mark Richards episode that was our second

128
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Episode first one was about Randy Cramer

129
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Who is a super-soldier allegedly

130
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,663
Who I

131
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
That's I will regenerate you and

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
And what have you and I started

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Batteries like

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Why did we do that

135
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
You couldn't have just been that I thought something was

136
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,743
Weird about space and I wanted to tell you about it even though you know there is

137
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
Some element

138
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
What was it what was Randy Cramer in

139
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Specific

140
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Well

141
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Here here's what I what I want to tell you

142
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
I remembered

143
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
That's the reason

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
That we did that episode in the first place

145
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Was that Alex Jones

146
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
Had an interview with a guy named Robert David Steele

147
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Who would come on his show

148
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
And said the kids are being kidnapped and taken to Mars base

149
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
True because the severe backlash for Alex was everyone being like you think there's bars bases

150
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
So here is that clip from Howard Stern Show back in 2017 where Robert David Steele

151
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
And was talking about how kids are being kidnapped

152
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
And take him to space

153
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
Why I agree with that and let me just point out

154
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Don't be just point out that pedophilia does not stop

155
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Sodomising

156
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
It goes straight into

157
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
Terrorizing them to Adrenalize their blood

158
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
And then murdering the

159
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
It also includes

160
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Murdering them

161
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
So that they can have their

162
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Bone marrow

163
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Harvested as well as body part

164
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Pedophilia is Monday original

165
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Growth hormone

166
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Yes

167
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Yes it's an anti-aging singing

168
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
And this may strike your listeners is way out but we actually believe that there is a colony

169
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
On Mars

170
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
It is populated by

171
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Play children who were kidnapped

172
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Incentive

173
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Space on a 20-year Rye

174
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,159
Damaris they have no alternative but to be slaves on the Mars colony

175
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
All kinds right

176
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Engineers

177
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
Said that you have no idea there's so much stuff going on but then it goes off into all that

178
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
I mean yeah that's the media jumps on but I do this

179
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
We see a bunch of

180
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,919
Looks like

181
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Close I don't want us looking into what's happening

182
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Everytime I'm off

183
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Alex you're one of the most original guys on the air and end

184
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
You asked what

185
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
I think you should be the truth channel in America

186
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
So

187
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
A real lack of any kind of like

188
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,191
In a pushing back or anything out and I don't

189
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,799
These theories go into this sort of thing but I hate man everything secret and

190
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
Response was to

191
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
Robert David Steele saying the kids are being kidnapped and taken to Mars bases

192
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Was I

193
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Maybe yeah

194
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,415
It wasn't like show your work

195
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,303
So Alex deserves all of the criticism that he got for that that is what precipitated us to go down the road

196
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
Project Camelot to begin with

197
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Now

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Recently

199
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Carrie got interviewed by Robert David Steele

200
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,567
Oh no it's in the last week or two I believe he

201
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
And so I decided why not

202
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
If we

203
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,735
Have this lack of joy and going through these Project Camelot episodes

204
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:06,367
Went to see if we could recapture some of the Magic by going back to the beginning let's flip it around

205
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
To move forward you our room back

206
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Start at the beginning

207
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
So anyway

208
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
Steele has his own YouTube channel that he's putting up videos on and spoiler alert the interview that he did after this one

209
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
The most recent interview I when I just checked was with the

210
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
Jim Fetzer okay hey

211
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,551
He has some pretty good ability to pick out the gas

212
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
We can't all be

213
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
So I wanted to go over this and there's going to be another

214
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,511
Stuff that might be a little bit but there's a couple things in here that I found to be like

215
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
This is what I'm looking for

216
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
To that as we go along but

217
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Robert David Steele opens this up

218
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Buy glowing in

219
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Kerry Cassidy

220
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Several years ago

221
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
I started reading

222
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Paranormal

223
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Nonfiction

224
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Domain

225
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
And I also started research

226
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Online

227
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
Project Camelot immediately popped

228
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
As one of the top websites in

229
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
The world

230
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
And I remember getting a

231
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
With you when I remember us having

232
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Conversation

233
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Overtime

234
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Tremendously impressed

235
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Bye-bye what

236
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
You're trying to communicate

237
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
So please tell us a little bit about

238
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
How you got started very very brief

239
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
And then talk about

240
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Some of your classes

241
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Cerebellum

242
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Some of the classics

243
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
People have introduced mendella with less blowing

244
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
I bet Robert

245
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
This guy's a communist

246
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
God Classics like Mark Richards

247
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,263
13 or so probably 11.

248
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
80-page being racist alien classics

249
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
The top five

250
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Guy with telescope

251
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Classics

252
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,575
So anyway. Get to talkin about some of the big hit

253
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,391
From the past and you know

254
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
That's about 2

255
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
But a couple of them we were very lucky

256
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
In other words

257
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
We not only were approached

258
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Buy top

259
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Of that nature

260
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
But we also

261
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Went seeking

262
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
The very top

263
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
People and

264
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
For some reason we were able to

265
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
At 3 to them

266
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Quickly and easily

267
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
And in the first year we must

268
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Just talked to Summer

269
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
The best

270
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Did ever

271
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
On this topic

272
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Or

273
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
People who said that they were the back

274
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
The sources on this topic

275
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,463
It's kind of indistinguishable at a certain point

276
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Do you got at some point you got to give people your

277
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
You got to open yourself up

278
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Too trusting

279
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
I agree with you in theory but this isn't going to be the time

280
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
So weird

281
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Doesn't specific

282
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,823
Sands at one of them is a name that we haven't talked about but actually it somewhere that a fairly interesting

283
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Alberta backstory

284
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
We've got a

285
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
A very long Sigma

286
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Segmented

287
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
With myself

288
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
My former part

289
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Annabelle Ryan

290
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
And David Wilcock all interviewing one

291
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Eye doctor

292
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Pete Peterson

293
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Lewiston Spa

294
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Castaway

295
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Got a year ago

296
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
But he was a

297
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Certify.

298
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Dr. Strangelove

299
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Evil secrets

300
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
This program

301
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Instrumental

302
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Also involved

303
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Creation of what

304
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Call Super

305
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
So those are few

306
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Captain Mark Richard

307
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Later

308
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
AR

309
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Camelot

310
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Rebut

311
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
He's also one of the

312
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Sure is

313
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
He's a doctor strange so doctor Peters terms

314
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Call someone a doctor

315
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Pete Peterson is a bit of an old-school name in the Paranormal

316
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Conspiracy type worlds

317
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Super old school

318
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
We were in 2029

319
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
A ways back

320
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
Project Camelot interviews like 2009 or something

321
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
I'm going to call that old school

322
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Maybe not 1950s

323
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
1970s alien guy but

324
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Anyway

325
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,487
He's made a whole ton of claims over the course of his career a bit of it having to do with his alleged former employment

326
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
When he was reverse engineering alien technology

327
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Picture

328
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Interesting Lee

329
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
I was looking into it a little bit and I was able to find a message board

330
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
Threat from September 2017 on Project

331
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Avalon

332
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Which is website

333
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
The Carey's former partner Bill Ryan

334
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
I thought you've been running

335
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Since he made a split with Kamala

336
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
Okay so they just now there's a

337
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
Just to different project

338
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,391
Project Avalon prior to that too but it's like his rhetoric

339
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Cuz I don't know of a f***

340
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Anton about Bill Ryan

341
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
I tried to watch some of the interviews that he does

342
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
I find them

343
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Incredibly boring

344
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Like most

345
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
This stuff is quite honestly

346
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,751
But there are few things that make me think like alright this guy is not great but at least

347
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
He's not

348
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
The worst he doesn't believe the MARC rich

349
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Good stuff good

350
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
And I found I found this thread

351
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
And it shows a little bit of character at least

352
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
So here's the first line that sticks out to me in this threat

353
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Miss post

354
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,951
Quote there's strong reason to believe that Peterson was lying knowingly

355
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,511
Or confabulated when he told David Wilcock

356
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,119
About the presence of armed police have his belongings including his truck were being seized

357
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
And much of it was being bulldozed into a pit

358
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
So as it turns out Jordan

359
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
This guy's house

360
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
Peterson's house is being foreclosed on right and that story ended up getting told as a secret government.

361
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Attack on him for spilling truths

362
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
This or something

363
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
In reality it appears that he was basically a hoarder

364
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:00,159
Hey when his house ended up there getting taken care of they ended up finding three dead cats inside and

365
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Just like a complete

366
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
Chaos toxic environment

367
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Government bulldoze in order

368
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
With armed guards

369
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,031
Trying to keep P Peterson away from his house living in that house at the time

370
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
It's all very complicated and why

371
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Of course

372
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,735
That mean post that I'm Rios reason to prolong this message board it was written by Bill Ryan

373
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,087
It's not just some user on the on the board saying that it's Carey's former partner

374
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
He goes on to say quote

375
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,463
Close examination of Peterson's testimony causes me personally to suspect

376
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
There's a high probability that some of the information he presented

377
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,143
In the 2009 Project Camelot interview was inaccurate exaggerated or invent

378
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,751
I I I do not anymore believe he was a reliable witness then

379
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
And certainly not now

380
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,407
Put simply this post is basically Bill Ryan saying that their interview with this guy was bulshit

381
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
He says quote

382
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:00,575
We did Nazi documentation his DD-214 any devices which he had or had made

383
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
Never saw his laboratory and never even visited his house at the time

384
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
We did and this is

385
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
In capital capital letters

386
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,095
No due diligence

387
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
I saw that going to different what

388
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,727
There's even reason to question his educational credentials

389
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,359
Apparently some folks who looked into the college the Peterson claimed to have a degree from

390
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,455
Found it it's a degree mail that likely wasn't even in existence of the time when he was supposed

391
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
Stupid in School he didn't even get his fake degree

392
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
It's unclear I don't know

393
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,415
I'm taking I'm taking a little bit of this Ray have to work investigation that these people on the Mets

394
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Supportive.

395
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Cuz I don't really

396
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Carol at much

397
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
It speaks volumes that bill Ryan made a follow-up post

398
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,679
After a bunch people had shown even more reason to doubt Pete Peterson

399
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
Story and Bill said quote I'm very close to making a public statement of apology the Project Camelot did not do

400
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Any due diligence at the time

401
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
And that at least some of what Peterson shared with us

402
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
May have been fixed

403
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
As each day passes

404
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
It looks more and more to be the case

405
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
Man

406
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
I don't like how you need each

407
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Which day passing I realized you didn't need the days

408
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
You could have just

409
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
Maybe an hour

410
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
Babies and maybe an hours would it take

411
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
Suffice it to say that this was a situation where it appears the

412
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
Peterson was not a mentally well person

413
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,055
Who was elevated to use to validate space weirdo theories based on things he was just

414
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Making up which seems like a pattern

415
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
With these people

416
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,711
Seems like there's a lot of these folks that we end up running into

417
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
Who took advantage of a guy who had mental issues in order to support their own

418
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Narratives and continue their own grips

419
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,023
It seems like that is a very high possibility out of character

420
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,863
As it turns out Peterson's main booster was David Wilcock

421
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,495
Who's a top to your face weirdo conman who believes himself to be The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce

422
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
And it's just he's too prolific of a dude to get into as a side note on the side

423
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
Episode about David Wilcock but like he's so prolifically

424
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,783
Like you've done so much there's so many speeches to like

425
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Try and figure out

426
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
When should we cover

427
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
And he's like Buckshot it's all over

428
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
So much do it that I would have such a hard time sitting down

429
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
I like figuring out alright

430
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Here's what's important

431
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,935
I imagine he'll only take me about an hour to disbelieve any

432
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
Very much seems to me you from what I've been able to suss out

433
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
It seems like David Wilcock was using Peterson

434
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,223
In an article that I found on a website called bended reality really reinforces

435
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
This feeling

436
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
This article is from December 21st 2019 which is a little bit after

437
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
After Peterson had died

438
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
Apparently after Pete passed away David Wilcox

439
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
Didn't interview where he was claiming that Peter given a deathbed can

440
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Confession we was getting ready to come forward about quote

441
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
He's experiences visiting 6265 different off-planet location

442
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,983
Among with other Sensational Tales so close to

443
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
So close so close

444
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
I want to point out here is like

445
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Some of these space weirdos

446
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
I like some of it

447
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Fun

448
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
And Dom

449
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
But some of these people are really f******

450
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Can Shady

451
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
No profit off you as long as you're useful to the grifter

452
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
Their industry but then would you die

453
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,512
He'll try to profit off you what are you going to stop

454
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
Trying to get a profit off the Golden Goose

455
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
It just really bums me out

456
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
Are fitbit's a real bomb

457
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Is it Golden Goose guys you just

458
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
Sell tickets to see the dead goose

459
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
So Carrie has this interview that they did with Pete Peterson I was like this is a grand thing that we did and then her other another

460
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Mike Richards

461
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
Your little is not great

462
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
So

463
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Robert David Steele

464
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Gets down to talking about like

465
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
What the

466
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Topics he wants to

467
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
The cover are

468
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
There are four quick

469
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Things I want to ask you about the

470
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
The whole human

471
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Trafficking

472
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Thing

473
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
The basin

474
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Yeah on Mars and Elsa

475
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
I swear

476
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
The kinds of

477
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Spaceships

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Had for the

479
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
3 years I think

480
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
The presidency

481
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Esports

482
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Is act

483
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Leah way of

484
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Justify

485
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Legitimizing

486
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
A force that is always

487
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
With h

488
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Approval

489
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
Absolutely

490
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Spell did not lose to

491
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
One trillion dollars

492
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
It was spent

493
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Space force

494
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
An underground base

495
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Isn't that I want to end up by asking

496
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Super-soul

497
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
So let's take these

498
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Is one at a time

499
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Very brief

500
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
The Carrie cast

501
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
City understand

502
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
I want to give Robert David Steele a tiny bit of kudos

503
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
And that is what you get in terms of the interview styles that I end up seeing he's all business

504
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
These attempts

505
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
You'll see I don't know if you'll be able to tell

506
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Just because these are

507
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,064
Clip that's what it's like listening to the whole interview

508
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
But he does try and stay on Focus

509
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Subway guy

510
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
I find novel

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,096
Yeah I can't remember the last time is you going to stick to these four tops

512
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,936
Okay see you now this is wild because Alex usually will give you a list

513
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,776
Topix I'll never touch

514
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah okay here are the bullet point

515
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Yeah yeah

516
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
It's faint praise though cuz I also think he's

517
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
A little bit

518
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
You know how do you know it's fake praise to say that Donald Trump could write

519
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
A hamburger essay Prince

520
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
Center he couldn't

521
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Hollywood Buffet

522
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
He's praised if he could

523
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
The thing that I find

524
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
It was like okay so these four topics are going to be out there with those are all like right where Carrie can hit a Dinger out of car

525
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Yeah but like

526
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
When you have like okay I think the

527
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,176
The Trump is making the space force in order to legitimize the secret

528
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
Space Program

529
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,552
I mean that is one possibility another possibility is

530
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
He wants

531
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,136
Space wars

532
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,720
A great bee behavior

533
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
So we're doing something completely loony

534
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
And someone legitimizing the secret space program

535
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Very similar external appearance

536
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,080
It's hard to parse whenever all things are possible I guess

537
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,664
Certainly chaotic evil can manifest in many different

538
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224
That's why you have to take things with

539
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
External context

540
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,368
Any issues like that I Can't Tell You Why Trump is doing that I have no idea

541
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
But if they're going to make that are

542
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
Then I will rely on other things

543
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Things that are said

544
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
In order to

545
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
To help me do so whether or not I should trust what they're saying should be listening to what is unsaid

546
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,824
So they're talking about aliens abducting people

547
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Right from Earth

548
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,992
So much happier to be talked about absolutely need a break from Dallas

549
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,552
So they're talking about the you know

550
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
I'm not here to be mister

551
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,488
Squaresville and say there's no one gets abducted by aliens

552
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
I do think the scale

553
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,632
That they're talking about you paying attention dude like

554
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
I think what Carrie is egg is a possum

555
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
What's Yonder

556
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Degree to which he

557
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Traded as

558
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,640
A food source and as a

559
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Chemical High

560
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
The degree

561
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
We are is

562
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
It is is very high

563
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
I already talking to

564
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Percentage of

565
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
Humans that are

566
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Taking a planet

567
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Had excetera

568
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
I don't know

569
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Year what

570
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Is it in that rain

571
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
It's it's

572
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
I would say it's around

573
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
Percent it could be higher than that

574
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
One-in-five

575
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
As we speak

576
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,064
They are specifically talking about a food source

577
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Are you I would doubt it yeah that's fair I can get high off their blood I don't think they're going to be

578
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
Hey you just you know you do five years as a hallucinogenic BloodSource and will bring it back ever

579
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Everything's fine everybody goes about to visit

580
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
It's not like you're abroad whatever you just a back rub with stories

581
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,456
The time in London look to your left

582
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Look to your right in front of you and back

583
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:35,648
One of the five of you will be abducted before the end of this class one of you will be food

584
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
Fat

585
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
I would it really does seem high

586
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,632
You know Robert David Steele saying like there's eight million people that go missing like

587
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,008
20% of the world

588
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
I'm not entirely sure cuz it would

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
If it was 20% of those people

590
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
Probably not on the census or like they're not

591
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,040
Population of the Earth

592
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
We don't even know how many people there are

593
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Right

594
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
I should be 20% more

595
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Yeah yeah

596
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
This

597
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
Tumi seeb

598
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,376
And this indicates either like it just a inability to like

599
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
Estimate

600
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
Or she actually believes like there's a billion people that are being taken

601
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
Does does that mean that our memories are being wiped so we don't remember any of these people because

602
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,320
There's no way that it would not affect each and every person on the planet

603
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
You know five people

604
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
Even assuming you know one person who knows another person who knows another present like there's no way.

605
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,656
Be affected by the six degrees I don't Kevin Bacon subject I don't believe stories of friends of friends

606
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Okay fair don't believe any of it

607
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Has there been

608
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Probably

609
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
So I obviously think this number is a little high

610
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,272
And I also think these people might be a little high

611
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
Absolutely ridiculous

612
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,928
Gary justifies this number by pointing to like

613
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
How this could happen

614
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
Okay we are talking

615
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Sing about also during war

616
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
This is a perfect for supper

617
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Perfect cover

618
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
In which

619
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
According to Marc rich

620
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
The reptilians can come in through the

621
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
The portals in the Middle East

622
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
And abduct large

623
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Humans

624
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Slaves

625
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
For these.

626
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Right

627
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Fascinating

628
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
It's pretty fascinating

629
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Yeah I guess so

630
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,624
I guess that's one way to like not have to emotionally wrestle with the fact that humans

631
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
Wednesday Wars against each other pretty hard stuff to deal with

632
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,120
When you get down to it right or feelings of culpability

633
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
That you would naturally maybe have to deal with about like

634
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,288
Things that your country's foreign policy is involved in and

635
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,712
That's hard so instead aliens are coming through Stargates and snatching up a billion people

636
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
I'm going to be honest with you

637
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
I think I'm

638
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:16,160
I think on the whole we might be better off with the with the Warriors I guess probably

639
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Assuming that the alien one isn't real

640
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
Is better to believe that one that's a good point feel as bad

641
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
It against this unified animated or we shoot me

642
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,176
Very nice so you got to carry sin War

643
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
Is probably how it's done

644
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Most likely

645
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
Just the alien snatching people

646
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
Robert David Steele has another possibility

647
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
I've been very

648
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
The illegal

649
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Alien issue

650
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
You ever since 2000

651
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Listen to when I predict

652
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
That they would be a mass

653
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Migration into Europe

654
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
And I realized

655
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
There's no way

656
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Tallying up

657
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Refugees

658
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
The Middle East

659
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
And the number that arrived in Europe

660
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
There's a delta in

661
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
So you see

662
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
People leave a country

663
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Try migrate somewhere

664
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
We don't know how many people left how many people arrive aliens

665
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Okay

666
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Aliens

667
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Okay

668
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Map

669
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
I don't accept

670
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,376
Maybe we can't get an exact tally but people who are good at estimating thing

671
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,496
Assume that it's fewer than 1.5 billion or migrated it's also probably

672
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,592
More comfortable to resume its alien sighting people up in like people die

673
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
Trying to Lee countries

674
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Much easier to

675
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,784
Like play around with alien ideas into recognize like

676
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
Some people end up completely displaced

677
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
They end up in places they didn't intend

678
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:57,792
Circumstance someone kidnaps them human traffic some along the way

679
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Do happen and they're terrifying

680
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
There's only one thing for alien only one type of refugee and that's a space Refugee Dan everybody else's kids

681
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
Chapter abducted or

682
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
I guess so

683
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,640
I guess.

684
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,248
Still I guess it just would like that's good enough for this topic which move on

685
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Move on to Mars bases

686
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Are we get into the bases

687
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Okay and remember

688
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Robert David Steele

689
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
3 years ago

690
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
Was on Alex's show saying that he believes

691
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
Ditmars is other bases

692
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
And they're taking kids there

693
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Children

694
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Where do you

695
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
All the witness

696
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
You've talked to

697
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
That we have bases

698
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Witnesses

699
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Bully funk

700
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
National

701
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Whatever

702
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Alright well

703
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
As far as I'm

704
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Concerned we have

705
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
We have bases on the moon and Mars

706
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
According course

707
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Multiple

708
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
This is very very

709
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Common knowledge

710
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
Everyone knows

711
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Moon and Mars base

712
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Also the moons

713
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Saturn in

714
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
We've been terraforming those which

715
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Sure how far along we are

716
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Currently that's quite a

717
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Collinear calling

718
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
And then also off

719
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Planet

720
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Not only off play

721
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Out of the sea

722
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
So with

723
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Going into

724
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Interstellar Nash

725
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
According to mark

726
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
The Raptors

727
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
I've taken

728
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Around

729
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
A human

730
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
That are on

731
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
A planet that is

732
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
Much farther

733
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
There are many many

734
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Earth-like

735
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Even conventional

736
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Scientist

737
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Will admit

738
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
And Enzo's

739
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Earth-like planet

740
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
It's out in the

741
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Solar systems out

742
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
Are where humans

743
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
I find that

744
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,976
Fascinating fascinating finds a lot of things Fascinate that he has a very standard response

745
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
Yeah

746
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
I would say that if I'm if I'm recalling things correctly Mark Richards is friends with the Raptors and they're supposed to be the good

747
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,728
Guys but now they've kidnapped 200,000 people to take

748
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,896
Some sort of they were all carrying chocolate at the same time

749
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,504
Population of Hershey Pennsylvania

750
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
Solve the case there we go

751
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
I think that makes them bad guys I'm not into an alien

752
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
I don't know I don't know if I was ever a Post-It

753
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Text Ryan stay neutral

754
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
I can't stay neutral take in the Raptor reptilian battled information as it comes to me and Carrie is a wrap

755
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
Sympathizer

756
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456
If they've taken 200,000 people just said weirdo alternate Earth planet and to be I find that trouble

757
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
Don't seem like even in the fake

758
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,600
Even the fake reality these guys are always on the side of the back

759
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Does he my wife

760
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
So that's enough for bases cuz we've established

761
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,584
It's common knowledge there's bases all over the place super soldier question

762
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Now what about

763
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Super-soul

764
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,960
Is that I've I've read about

765
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Reversion

766
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
To tell me about you

767
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Your sense of

768
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
The technology

769
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Used to create super soldiers

770
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Not only in the outer

771
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
But here on Earth

772
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,344
Okay well we're talking about trans

773
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Humanism in that case

774
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Duh

775
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,488
This is something that they are doing and have been doing

776
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Since my understanding is

777
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
Is the Dunkin affinion West

778
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
The first

779
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
Model super

780
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Soldier

781
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
In which he was in hand

782
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Also had

783
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
Additional cycle

784
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Capabilities

785
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
And Powers

786
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
4 +

787
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,336
Making use of what we call organ

788
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
It's also called Kundalini

789
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
In the Eastside

790
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
Duncan opinion someone that's a carry and I Project Camelot interviews while back and you can find a bunch of

791
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,720
People who have dug into him and then like they all bulshit

792
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Who's the first Super Soldier

793
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,096
Amazing she was able to talk to the first one

794
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
I still think it's Kurt Russell but okay

795
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
So you got this guy

796
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
He's been augmented

797
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
It's transhumanism

798
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
That is very specific

799
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
I think it's all it's all very

800
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
I just like saying words

801
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
What any real psychic abilities would be something I would listen to Hootie that's really f***** up Project Camelot interviews

802
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,256
10 years from now there will be a podcast that makes fun of me

803
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
You motherfukers

804
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
That is not true

805
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,752
I bet did not go well you don't need to be a psychic to of predicted that b would not land

806
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
I'd like your opening B on our guest

807
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
So you know we got this Carrie talks

808
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,760
The first Super Soldier the program's been going on ever since that dude

809
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Not just

810
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,904
The US would make super soldiers Nazis wanted it to

811
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
The Nazi

812
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
These were also the

813
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
The first people

814
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
At least in this

815
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Sort of

816
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Century

817
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,608
I guess in the last hundred

818
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Where's that

819
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Were

820
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Went down the road

821
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
God of creating us

822
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
So we were not the

823
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
The first

824
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
It came from the notch

825
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
And they were a universal

826
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Soldier in fact is the movie

827
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
That there we go

828
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
I forget which universe

829
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Soldier

830
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Progressively those

831
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Series of UN

832
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Movies

833
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
Dolph Lundgren in there

834
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Really goes back in

835
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
The Nazis

836
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
The progression

837
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
The development of the

838
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
You know they liked

839
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Hide in plain

840
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Hindsight so if

841
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
If any

842
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
This helps

843
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Salsa when

844
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
There are leak

845
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Because

846
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
What they can basic

847
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Beckinsale

848
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
The movie or the person just saw it they have a

849
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
The big imaginary

850
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Mansion in the movie

851
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:09,760
So I have no idea which universal Soldier movie carries talking about here but I assume one of these

852
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
Direct-to-video sequels

853
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Answer me

854
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,768
I kind of understand if your predictive programming stuff is in pop

855
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,096
Popular media Like You original universal Soldier movie

856
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
Make sense what I plan to extend to be like

857
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Horribly unsuccessful stuff that no one seen

858
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,544
Admittedly I don't believe in this kind of s*** at all

859
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
I also insist that if you're going to

860
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Play that game

861
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,920
You have to at least have some kind of a standard

862
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:44,320
Not everything could be predictive programming unpublished script can't be predicted program

863
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
A failed pilot cannot be predictive programming you have to have

864
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Align

865
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
Timecop I feel like that's in between universal Soldier and Universal shoulder is directive timecop Caymans

866
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
Out in theaters

867
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:01,984
Perfect that is I will give you a path I don't believe it I don't agree with you

868
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,104
Playing a fair game you're not playing you're not playing fair if you're using

869
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Directions to equal

870
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Not good

871
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
I agree

872
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
I agree

873
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
So I'm glad we're in agreement there

874
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
Do you know like super soldiers

875
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:24,000
I've heard of steroids is that like steroids are they giving him steroids reasonable question

876
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Super soldiers

877
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Died at young age

878
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Do they kind of like

879
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
We had a problem

880
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
With steroid

881
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Saladin the mill

882
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Military and if

883
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
If you take enough steroids your

884
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Collapsing

885
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Does the super

886
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Super technology

887
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Basically

888
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Eat the Beast

889
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Store do they sell

890
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Survive it

891
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Call people

892
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Meijer

893
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
Standing is were talking about

894
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Technology

895
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
That

896
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Is enhancing

897
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
Creating shop cyber

898
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
And if this is

899
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
To actually

900
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Actually

901
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
Better the human body

902
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
It can live longer

903
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Barbie murderer

904
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
Innov8

905
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Ali fight in

906
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
And do all this

907
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
They wanted to do so

908
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Bigger Bass

909
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
Bigger faster

910
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Better

911
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,968
You know Jordan there's a documentary that came out a while back about steroids called a bigger stronger faster

912
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
Does shockingly close to the words are used to describe these definitely not steroids super soldiers

913
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Maybe

914
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Maybe

915
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
The documentary was predicted

916
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,024
Two programming so I would think that she's actually talk about steroids when she uses

917
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,376
Almost the name of that documentary

918
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
Stand-on cyborgs getting into the Hall

919
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
I look it's up to the hall

920
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664
Strong position on it I'm not involved I'm going to go with Interstellar 9999 is for

921
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Predictive programing because that had

922
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
Daft Punk's great song harder better faster

923
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Faster stronger

924
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
It must be yes that must be it

925
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,720
So when we first did our first Project Camelot episode it was about Randy Cramer super soldier and of course now they're having

926
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,280
Conversation he comes up and would you know

927
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
I don't remember this

928
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,864
But it does seem like you probably did talk about it

929
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
He's bad magic limbs

930
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
Replaced

931
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,640
I don't know if that's ever been documented or prove that he's had magical

932
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Regret

933
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
Alright

934
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Biscuits

935
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,808
Tick carried on another path where they've already had universal Soldier

936
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Breaker broker

937
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,392
Battery

938
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Into that

939
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
All f****** movies and TV shows

940
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
Their number soup

941
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,536
Soldiers out there Randy Cramer talks about even

942
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Having the

943
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Technology

944
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
To replace limbs

945
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Or or parts

946
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
The body that can

947
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
You know

948
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Destroyed in a battle

949
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
He says that

950
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
To him that he's had

951
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Parts replaced

952
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
And so on

953
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Transformers

954
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Cloning soul

955
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
You can basically

956
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Growing are

957
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Yes

958
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
But there's also I don't

959
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Series Fringe

960
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Which Jesus Christ

961
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Were the Nazis

962
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Has to do with

963
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
Parallel Rancho

964
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
I'm going over to parallel

965
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Lower

966
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
Earth where you have a double

967
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
All of us

968
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Have doubles and

969
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Parallel Earth

970
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
This is an innocent

971
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
She might stay in the union Yang of

972
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
The being we

973
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
We call Earth that way

974
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Would be the dark

975
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
And innocence

976
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
You have to go

977
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
To another dimension

978
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Into

979
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Cross Inn

980
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
Into that dimension

981
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Can't access

982
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Individuals

983
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
Like in the movie

984
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
They're being brought

985
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Across

986
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
2

987
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
22

988
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Like the purse

989
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Person in this

990
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
As

991
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Been close to death

992
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
They're dying

993
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Able to be replaced

994
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,120
When the cross is over

995
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
In fact there's also a

996
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
A television

997
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Call counterpart

998
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Who sang i n

999
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
After since

1000
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to strengthen your argument that life is like Fringe by pointing to another TV

1001
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
It's a lot like the first TV show because you saw the second TV show damn helping really

1002
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
Program is at least like more popular than the universal Soldier sequel show

1003
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,559
Playing right game here and I'm not going to be too mad about it

1004
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
I like friends

1005
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
I looked interesting I've ever heard of

1006
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Counterpart

1007
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,823
I think it was a little bit maybe too ambitious

1008
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
From what I recall but

1009
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
It was interesting there's a lot of really into

1010
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,223
Absolutely

1011
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
It is it is never well acted Joshua Jackson he was killing people he still got it

1012
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
Don't know if you did that but it did show people he's still there

1013
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,487
I am not just Dawson's Creek

1014
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Installing bones

1015
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,095
Richmond weather

1016
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Myra Devon

1017
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Misawa

1018
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,775
They just do not have the creativity necessary to write their own s***

1019
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
Kerry Cassidy is a bad she's a failed screenwriter she's talked about that quite a bit in Hollywood

1020
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,015
Can't do it because she's not creative enough to lie her unlocks

1021
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
I'm not sure if that's all

1022
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
Is it said the phenomenon is but it is fascinating

1023
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
To me how just dislike

1024
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
What I can't get around is like

1025
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
The picking and choosing

1026
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Yeah Blake

1027
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
Okay yes

1028
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
You've taken Fringe to be reality

1029
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
What about

1030
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,567
That one. What about that one show where there wasn't electricity

1031
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
I do know that one girl

1032
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
I don't know yeah

1033
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
The 100

1034
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,807
Let's just go with that one is real

1035
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,463
Yeah I mean like okay there's an island that has regenerative properties and no one can find it on the map cuz it's constantly moving and time

1036
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,535
Can I do that I assume so Terry

1037
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,887
I don't know I want to pretend that Ally McBeal is real but I just can't live that life

1038
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
I think the picking

1039
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Choosing

1040
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Why

1041
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,311
Why is it Fringe

1042
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
I don't know because it's not and it's not even like it's quality Bass

1043
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
I thought French was good but where we just came from the universal Soldier direct-to-video shift

1044
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
You know it's quality seems like it should matter like I want to

1045
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
Television is my point I was trying to get you a time putting my finger on

1046
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
If I were to make an

1047
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Probably to carry that lost

1048
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
Israel she would not go well with it

1049
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
Maybe she would

1050
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
If you would rather not go there

1051
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
If you're making them to carry

1052
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
I think he would go along with them

1053
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
If you were making them against

1054
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
I think she would say that lost

1055
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Is b*******

1056
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
I just I don't I don't understand I don't I don't get it

1057
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,415
Now this next clip is probably the reason that I decided

1058
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Do this

1059
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
This this is where like

1060
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
It gets real

1061
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
So we're talking about like

1062
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
Your daddy don't use that for

1063
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
You got to this

1064
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Fringe

1065
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,175
And other show counterpart yet this other reality where there's another version

1066
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,735
Interview that you can get body parts from or whatever

1067
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
If you can get through portal or something

1068
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
Entirely sure they don't

1069
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Get specific

1070
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
But there's other ways

1071
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
The super soldiers

1072
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Can have like

1073
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
Super bodies or something

1074
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,071
Put your mic down for this good never going to believe

1075
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
That we get told about here

1076
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
And then I have a whistleblower

1077
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
That talked about

1078
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
People like Mark Twain

1079
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
And others

1080
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
That I've been reversed

1081
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Staged

1082
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
So they have this reverse age

1083
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
And in fact Williams

1084
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
Are we talked about him earlier

1085
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
He was doing what he was

1086
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Miss doing

1087
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Exchange for hope

1088
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
Hopefully getting for

1089
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Friends helping his family

1090
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Reverse age

1091
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
That he that

1092
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
Then would allow him

1093
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
How much longer

1094
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Go to younger age

1095
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
Generally from what I'm

1096
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Understand their reverse age

1097
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Someone to around

1098
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
To their 20

1099
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
It's younger for women they're like

1100
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
23 or something I was told

1101
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
If I recall

1102
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
Broccoli and then men it's

1103
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
It's a little bit older

1104
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
428

1105
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:14,271
I totally understand in this fictional reality why you'd want to reverse age some important scientist or something to do

1106
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,575
Doing Secret work behind the scenes at you know you want it

1107
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Continue

1108
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,159
But why the f*** would you reverse age buck

1109
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:26,559
Brilliant Iran I appreciate the Americana

1110
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
Unemployment

1111
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
What are my gray. I don't see what the point would be at making him immortal

1112
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
I don't get it

1113
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,103
Mark Twain was important to our country's history because he was a great writer

1114
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,455
Engaging public speaker

1115
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Continue doing

1116
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
If you were to have a second life. I don't understand name but people be like a bad you look a lot

1117
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
What makes Mark Twain

1118
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,463
You sound exactly like it but honestly the writing styles

1119
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,935
I am not I am Samuel Clemens

1120
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Also Mark Twain die tonight

1121
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
1910 so even if you took reverse aging pills and went back to the age of 28 you'd be 138 years old right now

1122
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:19,039
Again Naturally have to ask yourself is baby he took more reverse aging pills at some point just kept recycling

1123
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
But if so

1124
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
F*** did he do in his second lifetime

1125
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,279
I see literally no tangible effect in the world that could rightly be attributed to Mark Twain in the years since his death.

1126
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Seems like if he did live again

1127
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,399
He probably was pretty low-key about it maybe just wandering around Missouri

1128
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
He lives a full of rich people live

1129
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
He's earned a retirement complicated it seems

1130
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
But maybe not the best use of this

1131
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,271
Empirical technology for a shadow

1132
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
Yeah that's probably no good

1133
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
That's probably no good

1134
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:58,975
I have a suspicion that this whistleblower of carries just knew that one of Mark Twain's pithy quotes is quote

1135
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,839
Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of 80 and gradually approaching

1136
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
18

1137
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,167
Which I guess was then transformed into him being some kind of

1138
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,983
Reverse aging operation kind of thing

1139
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
If you would like

1140
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,335
If you wasn't like doing the riversage and then why would he say so

1141
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,199
Yeah I do why would you say something like that Jordan

1142
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
Fake weird random quotes being taken out of context

1143
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:27,391
To be like see obviously this guy knows this Secret

1144
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
Universal Soldier

1145
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:40,191
Why would he say that if you didn't already have some sort of Benjamin Button technology should I reference another movie

1146
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,799
Do you say that if he wasn't like Merlin of s*** that's right it's another fake think

1147
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,895
So Mark Twain maybe still walks Among Us has been reverse age

1148
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
With pills

1149
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Thomas pynchon

1150
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
Maybe

1151
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
So that makes no sense to me but Carrie has other rigs

1152
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,831
There are different ways

1153
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Dealing with

1154
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,671
With a super soldier and also

1155
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Keeping a human being alive

1156
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
And bringing them back so they're RX not

1157
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
You're not

1158
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
People who have been reversed age

1159
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
And in essence are

1160
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
Young men now

1161
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Call Rose

1162
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
I'm sorry

1163
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
Seat that makes sense yeah I heard her Von Braun is who you would say in this can help Mark Twain

1164
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Where to buy brownies

1165
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
Exactly who you would prefer Sage

1166
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,183
You like a genius rocket science guy

1167
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
Like spooky and evil he's literally a doctor Strangelove if you will

1168
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
If you're going

1169
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,311
The list of who's the first to get the Aging technology

1170
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,639
It may go wrong with the man Mark Twain

1171
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Absolutely

1172
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Absurd

1173
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,783
So you can talk in about the interstellar travel a lie it's mostly

1174
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Right

1175
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,367
Well that's the only way to get past the hole

1176
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Lightspeed

1177
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,975
Sure or the Van Allen radiation belts in whatever

1178
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
You got you got issues

1179
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
Apparently there are spacecraft

1180
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
But they're used to transport other spacecraft

1181
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Through worm

1182
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,959
Convoluted

1183
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,543
But there are a bunch of dimensions in the world right right

1184
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Another portal

1185
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:27,967
You can go through or something okay carries talking about that here a little bit and she reveals a secret power

1186
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,575
Or that she has to be unimpressive

1187
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
What what

1188
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
We're talking about is

1189
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
I sort of an Apache

1190
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Apache

1191
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Return to

1192
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Source as

1193
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
They call it and there is there a hierarchy

1194
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Is that one must

1195
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
Go through

1196
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
And levels

1197
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Frequency that you

1198
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
You raise your freak

1199
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
When seeing your able

1200
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,007
Go to go today to other dementia

1201
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,079
And if you ever gone to Sedona and you

1202
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
You go to the portals

1203
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,407
If you want to know what a portal is like

1204
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Go to Sedona

1205
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
Although they have them all

1206
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
The world ending Factor Rivers

1207
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
And lakes are

1208
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Are natural portals

1209
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
So the energy

1210
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
You can feel it happened

1211
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
If I can feel this

1212
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
My hand

1213
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Walk-around

1214
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Until you wear on

1215
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
On your property they

1216
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
There might be a port

1217
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,399
Okay if your superpower is being able to tell you where a portal might be

1218
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,959
Yep that is not a definitive power

1219
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,287
Maybe there's one here

1220
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
It's not

1221
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,383
Well I just told you there might be one I didn't say there was

1222
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,063
That is a soft power maybe divining rod

1223
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,367
Also I've been to Sedona

1224
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
IHOP

1225
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
You could be right

1226
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,583
I've been delayed

1227
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,191
I think she just revealed that it one point she was probably a

1228
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,799
I don't know maybe something that's straight out of elrond

1229
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
Do not necessarily it's all over the play

1230
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,431
Okay no paranormal

1231
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
Nice if that's very very

1232
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
Ubiquitous

1233
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Necessarily comes

1234
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,111
From him from Hubbard

1235
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,647
Are you

1236
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,999
She was still going to disagree with you

1237
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Thinking you could use that as proof

1238
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Hobbit

1239
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
FairPoint

1240
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,655
I don't know I mean I think on some level she's just expressing

1241
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
Exactly what I feel but I don't think it's

1242
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,847
Squirtle related and that is it like nature is great

1243
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
Viewing when you're out of out and about you don't you know you're not around concrete you know they're being at River at does have

1244
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Have some sort of that

1245
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,367
Behold the sunset if you're out by a river

1246
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
All the bugs

1247
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Does it start making noises

1248
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:51,839
Very atmospheric solutely

1249
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Fuels in

1250
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,423
Entirely different and I understand and I think what you

1251
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,215
Trying to express or what

1252
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
He's expressing but in the form of like

1253
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
There's magic portal

1254
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
I think it's just a very

1255
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,503
The Call of the Wild is what some people call it you could call it being Earth sensitive or being sensitive

1256
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
Being able to feel

1257
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Nothing

1258
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,391
But then you're interpreting that feeling

1259
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,951
I've been portals

1260
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,559
So Carrie just recently talked to a guy though that he lives on a ranch

1261
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
And that ranch is above

1262
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,935
Military base military base

1263
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
There's probably a portal

1264
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Involved

1265
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:36,127
The military base is being shared with ashtar command I'm just bundling

1266
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Nope

1267
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
I just interviewed

1268
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Re-interview

1269
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
John Edmond

1270
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
Who lives at Elana

1271
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
On a ranch

1272
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
Located on top of

1273
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Do the military base

1274
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
In Arizona

1275
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
And it's also been

1276
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Shared by the app

1277
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
And he has

1278
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,559
A tremendous number of portals on

1279
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,863
Is property where our beings are always

1280
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
And

1281
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,703
I am basically disturbing their life

1282
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Multitude of ways

1283
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,103
I heard that and I thought I heard a damn sitcom

1284
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,479
A guy is trying to find his business on a ranch having a great time

1285
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,831
All these aliens keeps showing up in meddling it's episodic

1286
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:23,231
You get out of different groups

1287
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,535
Because I think she was thinking

1288
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
Lisa Ryder

1289
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Describe that is

1290
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,239
There's all these portals coming out of this guy's Ranch and its really messing with their life like that

1291
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,919
She's having trouble they're there messing that they're turning the water off the electricity goes for a wire every time they portal in it

1292
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,271
Terrible LOL yeah Italy is a real

1293
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:51,135
I would watch my life when I watch more TV

1294
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,463
That sounds a little bit like Fringe

1295
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,559
Write the show write that show

1296
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
That's your ticket

1297
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
Dan Harmon

1298
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
We know the answer to this question but Roberts about to ask

1299
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,311
Is there an Interstellar war going on

1300
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Is there some

1301
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
Intergalactic war going

1302
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
I hear about

1303
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Reptilians

1304
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Palladium Theater

1305
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
Is the village idiot

1306
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Living in Oaks

1307
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
Virginia

1308
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
But I find this fascinating

1309
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
Can I find you a very

1310
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Incredible in

1311
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Person

1312
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
Conflict going on right

1313
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
And who's winning

1314
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,655
Yes it is kind of funny

1315
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
You say that I mean even pee

1316
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
That followed the Bible

1317
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Which

1318
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Does not know

1319
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Tell you the whole truth

1320
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Truth and nothing but the

1321
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,383
The truth and to understand that

1322
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
That we're in a war of Worlds

1323
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,991
You know that's the whole truth nothing but the truth is followed up by so help me

1324
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Show me God

1325
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
What's that part off

1326
00:55:54,111 --> 00:56:00,255
I just like the idea that Robert David Steele is like I think that you're a credible and interesting person

1327
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:05,375
After minutes earlier she said Mark Twain has been reversed age

1328
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,823
I'm enjoying who is Foghorn Leghorn better of

1329
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,199
I say I say now everybody knows you're a brilliant woman and I'm just a down-home country lawyer

1330
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:24,831
God so funny

1331
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,855
So

1332
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,183
0 hey there's Interstellar war going on but it's really like

1333
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
All of this is not human

1334
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,047
All et like all wars are

1335
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,839
Anytime you see a war on

1336
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
On Earth

1337
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,399
When I found out

1338
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
After all these years

1339
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Investigate

1340
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Is that

1341
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
All of those Wars have

1342
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
ET Bass

1343
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
So these are not just

1344
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
Towards Beach

1345
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Humans the way we convince

1346
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
We think about

1347
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
This isn't you know it's very

1348
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
It's very popular.

1349
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
I think about humans as a

1350
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Too warlike species

1351
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
Is actually that's

1352
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
Humans are not warlike

1353
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
In the way that these others

1354
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,255
We're talking about the negatively base

1355
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:11,423
I mean it's there's so much of this they did constantly pops up this is hiding behind but attributing things to eat

1356
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,239
Aliens that you don't want to recognize humans are capable of

1357
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
Yeah very weird to me

1358
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Hey bud

1359
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
Also Heights

1360
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
It also hides their fundamental fascination with war

1361
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
And their desire for

1362
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,991
To talk about all of the

1363
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:30,111
The heroism ended all that s*** that we associate with war

1364
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,695
Without having to feel bad about being one of the primary

1365
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Drivers of it I guess

1366
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
Not her specifically but you know Warren General

1367
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Break if you're going to have like a Randy Kramer's

1368
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,215
Celebrated murderer of tons of alien has protected the Earth

1369
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,007
Server for decades

1370
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,311
It's very strange

1371
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,359
Worldview to me

1372
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Bye

1373
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,479
So Robert David Steele asks if Trump knows about

1374
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,783
Casino about these aliens

1375
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
And I will say that

1376
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,343
Gary's response

1377
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
Interesting

1378
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
Is it fashionable

1379
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
Credible

1380
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
Interesting

1381
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Credible

1382
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Mysource

1383
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
To say that

1384
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
Yes Trump is very knowledge

1385
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Berlin facts

1386
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
Gordita Marc rich

1387
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
She's wife

1388
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,775
I is used as an alien condom

1389
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,311
Do it to a certain race

1390
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Switch you will not reveal to

1391
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Which race that is

1392
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,943
Except to say that it isn't the lion be

1393
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,223
Beings and it

1394
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
I believe it's not the

1395
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
The Reptilian

1396
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,599
I'm going to pause there really quick cuz there's more revelation

1397
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,647
B guess

1398
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Is Mark Richards

1399
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,463
Is not telling her which

1400
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,303
Race Melania is a conduit for that implies

1401
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,631
That is not a good race of aliens

1402
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
I feel like you would

1403
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:54,079
Play Erik Satie

1404
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,615
Or the reptilians

1405
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
Who's the Raptors he would just be like yeah but he has got a one-to-one hotline

1406
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Everything is cool

1407
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
We gathered our president is in touch

1408
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,903
With our allies in space it's good

1409
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,999
It's got to be one

1410
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:19,423
Has to be like a bad alien race

1411
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:25,567
I didn't know there was a lion aliens

1412
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,199
Well those the mercantil dogs

1413
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:37,087
Would be interested in Dan

1414
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,879
I know their Mercantile dogs

1415
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,463
And then they're the feline Contessa's right to archaeology

1416
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
But

1417
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,423
I didn't think of it those feline Contessa's were

1418
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Lion

1419
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
I feel like that

1420
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:02,431
Slightly different

1421
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
Does that mean everything in the feline what phenotype her or Jesus you know like everything

1422
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:16,255
Isn't it the case that a lot of those species came into being by virtue of like

1423
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,047
Natural pressures that exist

1424
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
On Earth

1425
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:24,191
That's true that's true that common ancestor is the feline family

1426
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:29,823
And you would assume that there if there's feline aliens they wouldn't have had the same pressures that would leave them too

1427
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,919
Genetic engineering they make

1428
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:37,759
All of themselves from the different cookie

1429
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,855
Good bi we got point is melania's probably in touch with

1430
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,951
With me lately

1431
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,815
I can't I cannot stress this enough the Assumption has to be if Mark won't tell her

1432
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
It can't be goodness cuz he always tells her

1433
01:00:54,399 --> 01:01:00,543
Specifics that's always one of his things is like there are certain areas where he's like I'm going to be one hundred percent specific

1434
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,079
And then others where you almost like

1435
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,687
She writes down that he turned and looked and gave me a knowing wink

1436
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,759
Like why didn't she ask him what race he was talking

1437
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Right

1438
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,343
And I'm his is silenced

1439
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Speaks volume

1440
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
That's what I would say

1441
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:19,487
Anyway there's more there's more news on the geopolitical alien front

1442
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
So

1443
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
This is

1444
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
Donut of what you're talking about

1445
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,631
Yes putinism

1446
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Ben Redden

1447
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
And even

1448
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Who's Chloe

1449
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
I understand it is that bad

1450
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,615
For a while now

1451
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
Rambutan

1452
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
The Clown

1453
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,223
Carpet bombing

1454
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Clone

1455
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
Dropping in there been a clone for a while now there is no food

1456
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Or I guess

1457
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,815
Is it the clown from the alternate universe that they brought over or is this

1458
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
It doesn't

1459
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,935
Von Braun make this

1460
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
This is the problem with this interview style is that even though Robert David Steele Is On Target and focus

1461
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,223
Not a lot of follow-up question which I would be interested to know exactly what are you saying about who is Putin

1462
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,879
Use that is the head of state for one of the largest countries in the world who sang He's a clone and that's a recipe to get a bug.

1463
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:25,023
We learn to that last wife also that they're late lion aliens

1464
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,047
Which is cool

1465
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:31,679
Find out about another race of aliens

1466
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
In the past

1467
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
But it's B birthday

1468
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,751
Funny feel like what

1469
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,055
What when you're called on to give evidence

1470
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,103
For these things existing

1471
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Where do you go

1472
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
There's also

1473
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
What if what

1474
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
Call the dragon mod

1475
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
That are

1476
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,039
Very diabolical

1477
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Evansville Airport

1478
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
Sydney Australia that has

1479
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
A gigantic

1480
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,183
Plaque

1481
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Carving of

1482
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
David Ragan

1483
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
Put two and two together on that one

1484
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,839
So there's a plaque in an airport

1485
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Insignia

1486
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
Apparently

1487
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
That has a dragon law

1488
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
And therefore

1489
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
Diabolical

1490
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
Okay

1491
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
Okay

1492
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Alright so

1493
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,639
Okay Dragon Mods

1494
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
Diabolic

1495
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Here's how you prove them

1496
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
There's a plaque

1497
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,015
Yeah there's a single pack

1498
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,111
One airport as far as I know yet

1499
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Put two-and-two together

1500
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Bingo

1501
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
There aren't even two

1502
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
It might be

1503
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
Do we know of one

1504
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,095
Glad one source of information and it's Terry

1505
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:39,775
So they get off the topic of some of these aliens and Robert David Steele wants to know about free energy

1506
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,359
You want Scott to end this interview. We ought to free energy

1507
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,759
And it turns out there is free energy as to do with vortexes or something

1508
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,783
Play

1509
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
Why didn't we dhm

1510
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:57,695
He's number one on the list right you think create Tesla

1511
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:04,095
But I know not.

1512
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,887
Mark Twain

1513
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,679
You wrote the book

1514
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Clever

1515
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,495
Use the n-word

1516
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,543
Two apparently we learned

1517
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,175
How you can get some free electricity and put down for this one too cuz I need you to hear the specific

1518
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
Specific

1519
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:25,855
I will say one thing about carry that you can really count on is that she does not get bogged down in details

1520
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,903
Not into the specifics

1521
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
Free energy comes out of

1522
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,719
The

1523
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,255
You know that the energy back

1524
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
The black hole

1525
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
And by the way

1526
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
Apparently there are black holes

1527
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,935
Chivas and and in the earth center

1528
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
Which is more

1529
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Information I'd be

1530
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
Lately so in essence

1531
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Free energy is all around us

1532
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
It it comes

1533
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
In fact

1534
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
I've been told by 1 /

1535
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Dick

1536
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
Something in the ground

1537
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
I'm in essence

1538
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Access

1539
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Electric

1540
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,367
So there are lots of different types

1541
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Energy

1542
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,463
Okay so if I understand correctly

1543
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,071
Someone told Carrie recently they can put

1544
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
Something in the ground

1545
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,167
Electricity

1546
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:17,055
Then it turns out that the black holes were inside us all a longer

1547
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,431
Somebody a nonspecific somebody

1548
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
Call Carrie

1549
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,735
They can take a thing

1550
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
Something

1551
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
Kudos to that thing and it could be

1552
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,623
Electricity

1553
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
380

1554
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,487
I really think she should get a pat

1555
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
Not that quick

1556
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Text somebody

1557
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,583
Tell her to go to bed. That thing

1558
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,143
Dave the stamp and mail it to

1559
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
See yourself

1560
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Yeah

1561
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:50,079
That's the kind of sentence like if you're doing an interview just can't let that slide nobody told me you put a thing in the ground

1562
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
You got free energy

1563
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,527
What are you talkin about Wednesday who told you that what is this anybody interviewing the president what are we doing what are we allowing you to get away

1564
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
This is

1565
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,415
Play we have black holes in us and we poke the ground any good electricity

1566
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
So that's free

1567
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
Cool

1568
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
Struggle

1569
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,119
It's going to take you a lot of energy to find that thing

1570
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,447
I think

1571
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
So also turns out Mark Richards

1572
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,799
Has

1573
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,615
Something he's been telling Carrie about another source of

1574
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:27,455
Energy comes to an end

1575
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:32,831
Are they they wrap it up is also another thing Tuesday Robert David Steele

1576
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
I'm trying to keep this interview tight

1577
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,927
It's going to be about 35 minutes we're not going to go

1578
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
Like in the same way stick

1579
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
That's why you don't ask what's that thing to poke the grass

1580
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:53,567
What thing is it you know it's something I can't tell you that tell you

1581
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
Who was a classified

1582
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Situation

1583
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
So there's another source of

1584
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Energy

1585
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,223
This is this is

1586
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,503
Bacilli end of this interview

1587
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Ann-Margret

1588
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Just talks about

1589
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
The energy from neutron stars

1590
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
That we are now able

1591
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
To fuel our craft with

1592
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
40 T's did not want us

1593
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,487
To have access to that goes beyond

1594
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
So

1595
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
Samuel. And I believe

1596
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
Airlines

1597
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
Using it right now

1598
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
For their planes

1599
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
What

1600
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
Airlines went bankrupt

1601
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
Didn't have to use

1602
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Free energy

1603
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
What

1604
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
You know I'm worried about radiation

1605
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
Sickness

1606
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,223
The people are being quarantined

1607
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
Bloopers

1608
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Same way

1609
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,295
As radiation

1610
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
We have to

1611
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
To stop because I've made it

1612
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
To my audio

1613
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
That I do 30

1614
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
1 hour

1615
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
Interviews

1616
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
Stick by that commitment my friend

1617
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
Can't go look can't do part 2

1618
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Note

1619
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
I enjoy the strong assertion

1620
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
That she believes

1621
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,799
The airline companies all went bankrupt

1622
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
Enter now have to use free energy which is from space

1623
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Answer me this

1624
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,991
Why wouldn't they have used free energy in the

1625
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,135
Well they have to go bankrupt in order to get access to the free energy

1626
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
Then the reptilians have them right where they want them compromised

1627
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,095
Alien alien Raptor Alliance

1628
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:24,447
And by virtue of that now all these aliens

1629
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,495
Can Fly for Free

1630
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
200,000 people out of here every day that's the whole idea that like curtain that goes up

1631
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:37,247
Charisma

1632
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,807
God dammit

1633
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:44,927
I didn't need that curtain is because they don't want to look back at us a dirty poor people that care no

1634
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Gazzara

1635
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:52,351
It's mantid beings and then partying

1636
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Why not

1637
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
A B B train

1638
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
Those curious about what

1639
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,007
Steel was saying at the end

1640
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
About the radiation sick

1641
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,407
Miss that he's worried about I watched another video of his and apparently he believes the

1642
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,967
The coronavirus situation

1643
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
Yes from free energy

1644
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:15,135
Well I believe it probably has to do with 5G cuz I think that's another that's another popular area of the

1645
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
Conspiracy world

1646
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,231
The weirdly I haven't heard Alex talk about why we haven't talked about

1647
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,791
Michelle

1648
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:28,191
We have to go to somewhere in Virginia where there's one no no he's talked about 5G relation to the Coronavirus

1649
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
Oh no that's been like it's all

1650
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:37,407
The China has 5G this is all just that they're trying to cover it and say hello Iris okay

1651
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
On that tip

1652
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,991
Watch another video of his are you saying that like

1653
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,575
These people there on the Plains and they get sick and then you think

1654
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
It's flu then you get them off

1655
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
Planes in the fine cuz it's radiation sickness

1656
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,719
Alright let's

1657
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
Alright I I don't

1658
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,071
Think that one's valid for a lot of reasons nope

1659
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
I like that he's

1660
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
Trying again

1661
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,655
You take things

1662
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Based on

1663
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,031
You can't take any real argument

1664
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,079
It's made seriously

1665
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
Because you're also discussing Mark Twain

1666
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
The Aging

1667
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:14,015
Through pills perhaps you're you're you're talking

1668
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
By the way

1669
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,063
Yeah yeah

1670
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
King about

1671
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
Fringe being real well

1672
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:23,487
Can just go in and get our Doppelganger from another dimension

1673
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
The clone of course

1674
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,863
Why wouldn't he put a thing in the ground to get electricity

1675
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,423
Underground

1676
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Hang in there

1677
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:41,663
This is absurd to love it when she just carpet bombs assertions that I've literally never heard any

1678
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,247
Anybody ever even consider as a possibility before and she just

1679
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,343
It's it's nonstop this was a tight half hour interview

1680
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,391
And there was nothing but gold there

1681
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,743
When you only have to watch a half-hour interview and you get Mark Twain

1682
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
You get thing in the ground

1683
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
Like its

1684
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,631
That's that's a good day in my book.

1685
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,215
It is Project Camelot could stay just that

1686
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
And of course

1687
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,103
You know nothing is nothing good in this world stays good

1688
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
But no especially not now

1689
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,663
We can at least

1690
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,687
Look at this

1691
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
New interview

1692
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,527
And Inc the ways in which

1693
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,831
It has no similarities to what

1694
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,111
Give us a break in the past

1695
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
And I'm glad

1696
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
For that so thank you carry even if we are to make

1697
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Making fun of

1698
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,047
This entire everything about

1699
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,839
100%

1700
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,887
At the very least

1701
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
20%

1702
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
Which is how many people we are missing

1703
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Yes

1704
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,847
Oh yeah I forgot about that to 20% of the population being eaten by aliens

1705
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,895
What I don't understand

1706
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
Like

1707
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
It it seems like it

1708
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,551
Easier to just believe that the problems are aliens

1709
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
Is there alien

1710
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,951
And it's so hard to stay informed about everything that's going on

1711
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,535
And really trace the the root causes Behind these problems

1712
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
And solve it

1713
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
So if you're choosing to go the he's

1714
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Easy route

1715
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
Why are you been making it

1716
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
Complicated and miserable to live in

1717
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:14,847
Like if you were going on a Carissa's Blitz why is it so miserable to be

1718
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
Tubidy

1719
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,919
Take the easy route man

1720
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,943
It's not miserable

1721
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
This isn't real

1722
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,063
So you're not actually facing any of the effects of like what

1723
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
The downside of

1724
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:29,695
If aliens were really right people all over the 20%

1725
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:35,327
What she's describing is terrified

1726
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
No

1727
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,471
Like when the whole point of doing this is to avoid the bad feelings of

1728
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:45,055
Instead of just instead feeling miserable and helpless in the face

1729
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Alien

1730
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,407
Feelings 200,000 people that ostensibly you like

1731
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
Yeah yeah I don't know real bummer

1732
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Yeah

1733
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:57,087
I don't have an answer for that I don't know

1734
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,135
I hate my government doing things

1735
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
In my name that I find

1736
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
Reprehensible and

1737
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,071
But I am fine if Raptors steal 200,000 people I'm still free

1738
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Come on

1739
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,679
Hey you know you got to look at it as on a sliding scale

1740
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Yeah at least they haven't

1741
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Abducted

1742
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
5 billion

1743
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,311
Sure yeah

1744
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,127
So this is been a little bit of a fun break

1745
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,431
We'll be back with another episode

1746
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:28,575
There's a secondary aspect to this too which is like really pointing out that there is

1747
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
Super Bowl

1748
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Between the worlds

1749
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,671
Of Alex Jones

1750
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,463
And Project Camelot then

1751
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
Necessarily appears

1752
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
Like you have this interview work area saying this stuff about like

1753
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,375
Mark Twain got.

1754
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,703
I know I keep going back to that because I love it

1755
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:49,311
Much like the last season last episode of Friends

1756
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,895
Arthritis the age

1757
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Alright

1758
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Spoiler alert

1759
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
I think it's I think it's past it

1760
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,879
You're going to watch you to watch it

1761
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,183
I regret nothing

1762
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
So

1763
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,047
You have Carrie saying stuff like that and it is like

1764
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,375
Really out there in like obviously you'd have to be just

1765
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
Completely incredulous

1766
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:20,799
Do not be like hey what are you talkin about me any kind of evidence of any of the things that you're saying

1767
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:25,919
Every know it's silly and and you can write it off as like all these just people saying they're stalking

1768
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
Which is being interviewed by a guy who is

1769
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,807
Frequent guest on Alex's show hell he said

1770
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,623
I believe children are we

1771
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
So like

1772
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
It's

1773
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,511
The connection is it's closer than they might feel comfortable for record

1774
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,351
I kind of feel like the only difference in worldview between Alex

1775
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,887
And carry is

1776
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Haisten movies

1777
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:54,079
Maybe you know like I'm talking depending on the movies that they want to believe are predicted to have a grabbing that's where they go

1778
01:14:54,335 --> 01:15:00,479
What day are you more into sci-fi

1779
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,063
Which one do you want to go with us about

1780
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,183
Yeah I'm talking more about like what standards do you apply to what you're putting Ops

1781
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,279
Alex was perfectly comfortable having Robert David Steele on

1782
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
And for public

1783
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:19,935
Presenting him as an expert in stuff until he went a little too far and then he had to be like

1784
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:26,335
Give me exercise cuz everyone was making fun of Alex for believing in me

1785
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,127
Acrobat where is like

1786
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
It's the same

1787
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
Level of

1788
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
Wedding

1789
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,575
That leads to Project Camelot doing an episode with Pete Peterson

1790
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:41,951
Where are they now in 2017 power bill Ryan has to come out and say

1791
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,279
We didn't know due diligence on this interview

1792
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
Like it's the same

1793
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,095
Level of work

1794
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,631
It's being done by

1795
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
These two things

1796
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,703
Just one is political espionage

1797
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
And one is

1798
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,287
Magic space.

1799
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,079
Get back to what you're saying

1800
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
Hey did you prefer The Manchurian Candidate or Universal Schultz

1801
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
That level of just like

1802
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
I don't give a s*** let's do this

1803
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Then

1804
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:15,231
Whatever your taste in movies will dictate the product

1805
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,583
Nothing I think I've ever thought

1806
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,983
We we will until then we have website

1807
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,127
