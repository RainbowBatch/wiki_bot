25
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,768
Oh no beginning of January I made it announced

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816

Sponsorship

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
As it were

32
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
That we would begin

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Doing

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
This film

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
And that we would put out the episode starting

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
In

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
February

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
36 hour livestream

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Pazzo the report that we have now it's going to be our last episode

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
What we hate dad

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
Continue can we get into the larger philosophical issue

42
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Point

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,224
Is this going to be our last episode in January and we've made it 85%

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
And here's where I'm at

45
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
There's no damn way

46
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
That we can make that kind of progress and then BB like

47
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,000
Deadwood $15 short to do

48
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
As much as I love you and thank you so much for chances are

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,752
Disappoint The Listener

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,848
Even though responsibility to those who gave that fifth

51
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,992
Team dollars to do a f****** good job that's what I believe in

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
To donate

53
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
And with the understanding that people will continue to donate

54
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
Hey man

55
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,352
We would take those episodes off

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
For me to say like suck you off

57
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
Doing that anyway

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,384
And we have to figure out exactly what the structure is going to be

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
And because we didn't

60
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,040
We might end up putting the first one out in the middle of February but it will be

61
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,304
Sing it all the way to play by our own rules

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
So are coming and I appreciate it

63
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
In recognition of the fact

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
2008

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Edmonds Alex Jones episode

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Now I've got a whole bunch

67
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
The endgame I've got to be breaking down

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
You're going to have to work very hard and

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
Well

70
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
None

71
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
0%

72
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,720
And I realized it like you know before

73
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
That deep water

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
I realize that I need a break

75
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Need a break from Alex Jones

76
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
So here's a clip of what we're going to be covering today

77
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Really easy

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Did you get ready

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
Did you hear what that man

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
I don't need it up late again

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
Really easy to blow up a planet for example

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
First people on earth

83
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,023
We are

84
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Okay

85
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
So you know pre-show

86
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Jordan said Turn My Headphones

87
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,383
Camelot and I want it I want it all over the place

88
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
Finger on the pulse of Project Camelot

89
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Mark Richards

90
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,207
Who doesn't keep a pulse on project question

91
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
Literally find stuff that's like there'll be weird

92
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Interviews like

93
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
I don't I don't

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
But

95
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
I saw one

96
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
There's a gentleman

97
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
By the name of Courtney Brown

98
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
He comes on the show and they talk about

99
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
The war in heaven

100
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Yeah

101
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
So Jordan

102
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,439
Glitter 11s

103
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
Let's start off as the interview starts out with Kerry Cassidy or friend

104
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
The show

105
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,847
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot on I'm here tonight with Courtney Brown

106

And we're going to be talking about his team's remote viewing

107
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Afraid from the Bible called war in heaven

108
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
And this should be a really fascinating show I'm going to bring Courtney on the screen here with

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
And Courtney say hello to everyone

110
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119

00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
So Jordan

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
You are the cutest

114
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Did she just say

115
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Remote viewing

116
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Oh yeah

117
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Oh yeah

118
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
You're not with the phrase

119
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Awardhacker

120
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Yes

121
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
So these guys are going to be remote viewing

122
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
Like like they're going to

123
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Are office

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,695
They're going to do with the

125
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Think about remote

126
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
I do not know everything about it but I do know that it's not real

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
I did I should have

128
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
I know that much

129
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,775
A little bit more as the episode goes along

130
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
You get to go to some of the specifics of it and what have you

131
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
And

132
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
I can't stress enough you have

133
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
No I

134
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Idea where this is going

135
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
This is going to be one of the more f***** up episodes

136
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
That we've ever gone over

137
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
Unintentionally

138
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Kerry Cassidy

139
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
Has no idea either what she's doing

140
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Okay

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,935
I don't want to I don't want to give away too much too early

142
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
So let's get into this next clip where

143
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Courtney Brown

144
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Give us a explanation

145
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
What he does

146
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
What I like to do in this case I do think

147
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,647
A lot of people will know who you are but give yourself a brief introduction

148
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
And then we'll just launched into the

149
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Remote viewing

150
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
And

151
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
Perhaps introduce the the various the viewers that were involved

152
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Also

153
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,567
You going to make reference to people who are the remote viewers one of them is named disease

154
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,175
One of them but it's a normal name and then other one is named princess

155
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Right don't be distracted by him referencing

156
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Princess

157
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,647
If you won't promise to remote viewing smoke-filled room

158
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
What does that mean

159
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
It's an old John Fox

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Call Joe

161
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
The lazy dog jumps over the sleeping fox or whatever but I'm typing test to firefight

162
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Fossil

163
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Sloppy joe

164
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,063
Okay sure I'm Courtney Brown as you know and I'm TV director of

165
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Farsight Institute

166
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
And The perseid Institute is a nonprofit and we are

167
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
The largest biggest

168
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Venue

169
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Public

170
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Fully

171
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
Fully open public projects

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
For remote viewing in

173
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Anywhere

174
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,847
And so what we do is we use remote viewing which is a mental procedure that was developed

175
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Originally by the

176
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
United States intelligence Services US Army

177
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,807
Military to use for Espionage purposes 10

178
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
We're civilians named leaves

179
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
Procedures have driven original military procedures

180
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
And

181
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
When using for exploration

182
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Scientific

183
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
Huge number of projects that we done on our end available on our website for site.

184
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031

Well I went I went too far

189
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183

00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Stuff like

191
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
Sounds like this guy has done

192
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
I mean

193
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
If what he was doing was real he's doing the Lord's work

194
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
Is he working really hard to Hitler's mind Becca when he was giving speeches

195
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
911

196
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,943
He's figured out what happened with the JFK assassination Martin Luther King

197
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
Roswell Area 51

198
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Explosion

199
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
The Giza Pyramids

200
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
The mysteries of multiple

201
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
University

202
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
He's figured out climate change

203
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Atlantis

204
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,863
Also he's done that real problems we got fake problems

205
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Figured out

206
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
911

207
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,151
Can you give me an idea of a

208
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
Of course I watched a bunch

209
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Shazam movie

210
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
Videos that are free and they're the most ridiculous

211
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
But you've ever ate someone standing at a dry erase board usually in front of a green screen

212
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
To the green screen

213
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,911
Some cool image behind it

214
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
Send lots of sandwich

215
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Trust Atlanta

216
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Government

217
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
CIA approved technique

218
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
Another interview

219
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,391
Complaining that the CIA the government weren't using the remote viewing technology correctly

220
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
Exactly

221
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
Civilian funds but

222
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Imagine what I do

223
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Groundbreaking

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Revolutionary Technologies

225
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Inside the Mind

226
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Hitler

227
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Snow White

228
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
So what he's referring to is the thing called project Stargate

229
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
Sometimes referred to as operation Stargate

230
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Kurt Russell

231
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
I see umbrella name of a series of secret project

232
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
Back from the 70s and 80s

233
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
That the government was doing

234
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
To look into remote viewing

235
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
Psychics that crazy at the reason they were doing that is because there were rumors flying around that Russia was doing it

236
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
I may need it to

237
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Keep up

238
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
The Russian

239
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
Have a remote viewing leg up

240
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Figure out

241
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Psychic

242
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Sprite Davis

243
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
The project ended up being

244
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Continued

245
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
In the 90s

246
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
Because of like

247
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
Yes

248
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Absurd

249
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Keep doing this

250
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:51,327
Government aspect that you talking about

251
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
The Men Who Stare at Goats was made about

252
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
It wasn't right right

253
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
The other the other piece of it is like people have tried

254
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Constantly

255
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Play U2

256
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Empirical evidence

257
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
That

258
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Remote viewing is pasa

259
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
And every time they do so

260
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Incredibly vague

261
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Suggestions of life

262
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Like I see it

263
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,463
Stuff like that and then if you want to believe it you'll go ahead be like oh that's

264
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
That's proof enough for me

265
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
But it's the thinnest

266
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
Whatever it's all right.

267
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
In control

268
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Seeing somebody with the letter m

269
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
If you know that kinda

270
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
And then you just fill in the blanks I am painting a picture

271
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Intentionally

272
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,711
People are just making it up

273
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
They're they're goofy they're Goofy

274
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,135
They're just standing in front of a dry erase board making s*** up doing it basically improv game

275
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
That's what I'm saying

276
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
That's what I'm saying

277
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
Brown wants to tell you something else

278
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
He wants to tell you about the rigorous

279
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Training

280
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,935
The his remote viewer is go through

281
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
Typically the training for people to do training at farside

282
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
The training just the beginning training

283
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Takes 9 months and that's

284
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Twice a week all day

285
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
For nine months without a break

286
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
So you're talkin about

287
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
Between 16 and 20 hours of work

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Every week

289
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Renee

290
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:26,559
Streaming

291
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
About you screaming about crazy in like out that's nonsense

292
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,775
You would know

293
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,383
There was a place in Columbia Missouri where I spent a large

294
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
Which portion of my life called the school of metaphysics

295
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,551
Non accredited school

296
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
And you have to do

297
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Diaper

298
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
Because a friend of mine got duped by them

299
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Hundred tons of money

300
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
Trying to come up the rank Scientology Style

301
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
And they would have similar things you have Visa

302
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
Were you need to like go through all go over all this stuff

303
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
18

304
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Classical technique of breaking

305
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,663
People's will but it's not bad it's not an aggressive technique

306
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
Sleep deprivation and playing loud music

307
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Cooking dogs on you

308
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
What is a way of like

309
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Letting your guard down

310
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
In a slightly friendly

311
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
Or supposed Academic Way in order to rebuild you in the mold that they want you to be

312
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Basecamp

313
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Basecamp

314
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Bootcamp

315
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Pictures like that just like that

316
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,567
The first time that I heard this

317
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Lake Winnie

318
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Describe

319
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
Salat immediately was selecting that the people who come out of that training

320
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
Crazy enough to a god threw it in the first place

321
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,207
Your organization will never be infiltrated with naysayers

322
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,815
You'll never have people who are involved her like that maybe I'm not actually doing anything.

323
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,423
Me for 2018

324
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Infiltrate

325
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
ZZ farsight Academy

326
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
2 + 2

327
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,199
I originally thought it was called Fireside knows like

328
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,599
Brown is one of their professors

329
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Professors

330
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
All of their classes are just

331
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,767
Fat lip got kicked out of the University that offers battery

332
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
We learn more

333
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Will the universe exist

334
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
And then they start appearing in our time goes by Jack which is a predicted news bill that comes out once a month

335
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
When they do that

336
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
But they make

337
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
Is they end up in this time Chronicle or whatever the name that he literally just

338
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
But I can just look at the website

339
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Cross project

340
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
I watched a couple of

341
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Does this as well

342
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
What is supposed to be is the vix

343
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
You have to get you get you really get into it in the fifth

344
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,103
Like you got to get through the first four where there's 200 tablets

345
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Sigma characters

346
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Episode 5

347
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
What I was describing lost

348
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
You at the farsight

349
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Academy

350
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Computer whatever

351
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
They have a

352
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
TV show that they put out on YouTube

353
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Where they tell you what next

354
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,679
Next month's news is going to be

355
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
What are the predictions of basically there's going to be trouble in a State Building or something like that

356
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,503
Supposed to be in November and then so at what they end up

357
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Medusa weather like

358
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
It's going to happen next

359
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Month

360
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Yeah that is what it is

361
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Is a do like okay

362
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
And then when they put out the next month's video

363
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
The beginning is this guy Courtney Brown

364
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
Having a discussion of the predictions they made the last month I thought The Interpreter

365
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
It's crazy

366
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
There's so much you can go watch if you want to

367
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,463
I'm going to main line that so I watched one and like I said that prediction

368
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
House building

369
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Before informal thing

370
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
It was supposed to be prediction

371
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
November

372
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
And so when Courtney Brown the next month

373
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
Is giving an explanation he's like

374
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
So I easily figured out what this was

375
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Because they'd had such a great drawing

376
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
And the lady who is doing the prediction

377
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,503
I'm so he's his music she was predicting

378
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Milo yiannopoulos

379
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,903
Is trouble on one of those University of California campuses

380
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
Exactly

381
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
October 31st and we were looking at November cover the news it was reported in the

382
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
News November 1st

383
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
So that's why we cover fee

384
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
Too many rules

385
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
Aldi's

386
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Anyway he has a psychic new show

387
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,879
1005

388
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Settles with the wrong

389
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
It wasn't going to happen

390
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
We're doing the statistical analysis for that now it's been extremely successful since we started in May of 19

391
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
For 2016

392
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
And

393
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
Grandpa almost a year about or about a year of that then I start working on our Mysteries projects which are

394
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Big projects that turned into movies

395
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,927
Projects such as the Great Pyramid of Giza

396
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
Atlantis that are available for free

397
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
I turned into the Disney movie Atlantis

398
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
I'm a guy who loves watch

399
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
And I will say

400
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
That this video that I watched

401
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,751
Of him and his remote

402
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:32,383
Is one of the worst things ever watch that Atlantis

403
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
Oh by the way there is no right

404
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,463
Call Parisa is regular movies through Vimeo and Amazon and DVDs and things like that

405
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,815
Heaven is one of those that just came out and it's a three-hour

406
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
Believable

407
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,471
Very believable

408
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
No it's

409
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
Just conceptually it's so amazing that you think

410
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Impossible but it is very possible

411
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
We were able to pursue what this is all about

412
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Also it's

413
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Scott 12

414
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
I was going to pay that

415
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,952
Coming soon

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
On the website it says the Amazon link will be updated when they're available

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
Did anybody

418
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Nick Cage

419
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
Will do that movie for twenty bucks

420
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Tuna sandwich

421
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
Guaranteed

422
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
Left Behind of course

423
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
To watch this thing

424
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
Yeah probably seems like you would do just about any

425
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
You might be asking yourself at this

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Even though you know we can't watch it

427
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
Who's still wondering what is this Lauren hasn't about

428
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,984
What's going on with completely forgotten about that why is he

429
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Can you describe

430
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,200
So to speak how they were given the Target and

431
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,088
What I am not sure what the objective was why you chose that particular

432
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,928
In many cultures many religions

433
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
There are the talk is written in ancient texts

434
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,400
About this big battle that happened along the gods and things like that

435
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
And you get that

436
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,288
She get that in the ramayana and hinder text you get that

437
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
And has alien check

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Bring back the

439
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Kitchen is alien

440
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,208
And he's roundly criticized for not being able to translate the length

441
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,328
Translate Sumerian

442
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,704
To the question of why are why does this war in God

443
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
Beam seem to run

444
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Consistently throughout

445
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
So many cultures

446
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
I would give much

447
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Simpler explanation

448
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Then.

449
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
What he's going to give here in a minute

450
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
And that is that

451
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
You know

452
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,576
Cultures needed an explanation for phenomenon that they couldn't understand

453
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Science

454
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
God nature that's

455
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
And then they had

456
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
To come up with a reason why

457
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
Things happen obviously it's because he's God

458
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Aren't working in

459
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
That is consistent throughout all cultures the reason that there's

460
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
Trouble is because dumb God

461
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Petty differences with other gods

462
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
And we are Pawns

463
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
Get killed in in the mix

464
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
As they play out their struggle

465
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
That's why

466
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Could you have

467
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Explain

468
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Salmon you have to explain natural disasters

469
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
You have to explain those sorts of things

470
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
They're actually right

471
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
Everybody is always known the

472
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
The gods have been fighting and we have to

473
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
To figure out a way to stop them

474
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Providing so what we're going to do

475
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,912
Way to go back in time to before the gods were fighting

476
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
We need to drive

477
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
All right over there

478
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
We're going to also

479
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Hitler

480
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
The god start fighting

481
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Assuming it's Hitler's fault

482
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Did something crazy

483
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
You know what's crazy about worship

484
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
Here's the weirdest

485
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
The Greek pantheon

486
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Just such a weird thing I'll tell you why

487
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352
Did you remote view that Hitler has okay

488
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
Cena from his

489
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:47,104
Let's get back to the war in heaven stuff

490
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
Yes

491
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
You decide about the war the war

492
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,880
And in the judeo-christian tradition you have to have it both in the Old Testament

493
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
In the New Testament the big mention of courses

494
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
In Revelation

495
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
Answer the Book of Revelation chapter 12

496
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
47

497
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
There was a war in heaven

498
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,960
And Michael and his angels fought and the dragon and his angels fought

499
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
All of these different cultures

500
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
Different religions different prophets different everything

501
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,504
Separated by hundreds sometimes thousands of years

502
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Go after religious studies

503
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Professor

504
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
So the real question was

505
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Let's go remove your project

506
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
Where are we

507
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,520
That word does that phrase in chapter 12:7 in Revelation

508
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
What is this so that would

509
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Start Pugh

510
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
So the time to kill was

511
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
Whatever the perceptions were the original prophet

512
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
Who is receiving this

513
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,112
Saying that he later called the Warren heaven and wrote the Book of Revelations about

514
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
And

515
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
We wanted to find out what time for what

516
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,024
Whispers

517
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Until we got it

518
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
So they got it

519
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:19,264
Play I want to go back and figure out what was going on with John of Patmos

520
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
They're going to start

521
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
A remote viewing

522
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Inquiry which I love

523
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Because that makes

524
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Sounds like there's a big bureaucracy

525
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Percy of like

526
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,808
Like there was a pitch meeting where these two low-level guys are like hold on

527
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
We're going to see what happened

528
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
With the war on have

529
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Brewski

530
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,816
Just just throwing that one out there and they're like okay well we're going to take that whether or not I'll have in it

531
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
It's Friday

532
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Really need to talk

533
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Actor John of Patmos

534
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
Whether or not

535
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
Right

536
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
What

537
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
We're going to go

538
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Find out

539
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
What's your deal

540
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
What's which got your crawl

541
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
You going to get into John of Patmos here in a minute

542
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Before he does

543
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
He's going

544
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
To explain

545
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Some of the results

546
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Look what they found

547
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Do they have fidget

548
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Citgo results

549
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,400
Do they eat the Whiteboard

550
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Is a physical

551
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
He does he makes the claim here the beginning

552
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
I'm here that the fewer the remote

553
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Communicate with

554
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Each other

555
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
It all came up

556
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
And I don't care that he saying

557
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Cuz I don't necessarily believe it

558
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
And further

559
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Play out one of my big critique

560
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
At the end of this here real quick

561
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
There's no communication between them

562
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
All got the same thing

563
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,448
Huge space battle between basically two planets

564
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
And basically to

565
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Different species all there was a couple of the species evolve

566
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
He was really like a Star Wars that thing

567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,624
They got the Falling Rocks the lava rocks coming down everybody got the same thing these two opposing

568
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
Spaceships and everything

569
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,304
Aggressor species that look the reptilian

570
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
More humanoid

571
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Very similar

572
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Different but similar

573
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
They were battling it out then the humans

574
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Humanoid

575
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Reese's blizzard

576
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Underdog

577
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
They were the ones

578
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,112
Getting the bed they were getting species was the Italian

579
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And they were nuking the place

580
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,232
They were they were nuking the place they were

581
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
They wanted to control the resources they wanted to control the planet

582
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:56,192
It looks like that other the other planet

583
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Is a

584
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
The Last Resort just put a Zork

585
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Chespirito

586
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,408
Shawna Baum towards the bigger planet that they reptilians came from

587
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
And destroy the entire planet

588
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
It was a

589
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
You know it was a Doomsday

590
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
Type of a situation

591
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
I'm sorry I cheated

592
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm wondering is

593
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
Became clear I guess partway through the sessions I think

594
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
It leads to the viewers that I were talking about Mars

595
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Yeah they're pretty crazy

596
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Oh yeah

597
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,992
Is forthcoming

598
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Me most about this

599
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
He is just f******

600
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
Like we just he just f****** identifies with the humanoids because

601
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Cuz they look like

602
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
The humanoid

603
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:01,216
Committed before the plan right

604
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,872
This is an expensive Alex Jones excusing all white terrorism

605
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:14,272
Jerry Springer crazy how this overlaps a little bit

606
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
But

607
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
I want to point out here

608
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Is all just basically

609
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,464
This is the stuff right out of Zacharias

610
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Books about

611
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
The planet

612
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,400
Also Ender's Game if I remember correctly

613
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
This idea

614
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,544
Talk beforehand about what they're going to

615
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
You're saying this

616
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Charming

617
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
Because I would Gamble

618
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Everything I own

619
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
That the people who go through his rigorous 9-month

620
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Process

621
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,112
Basically having their they're brainwashed

622
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
To some extent to become one of these remote viewers

623
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
I think they're probably in ink

624
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Credibly

625
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Hi in

626
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Who go through that who are

627
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Really interested

628
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
I think that they might self-select

629
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,824
In some ways for people who already know this mythology

630
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
The scientific sample isn't

631
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
In this case

632
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Are you saying that

633
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
I think they were published in

634
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Now I can't remember the name

635
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Forsyth

636
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
Know that it read

637
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Rimmed

638
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
Natural biotechnology

639
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Technology

640
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,400
I love

641
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
Don't do this again

642
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,080
There's a giant battle my friend and she's going to later called Martin

643
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
Is the one that got marduke

644
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Also possibly known as

645
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
D'amato's old-timey religions ulma

646
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
Play this is 100% out of 6

647
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
Is it two or three of his books and

648
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
This is just exactly

649
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
What position believe

650
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,400
Repurpose nonsense from mythology

651
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Nocap

652
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Do some explanation

653
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Of all religions

654
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Let me have on Earth

655
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Where do they come from

656
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
Revelation was pretty weird

657
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
What happened

658
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,064
And Courtney knows allegory for the fall of the Roman Empire

659
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
You're a fool

660
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
It's our first Target was

661
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Original profit

662
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
His perceptions when he

663
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,608
What is Rhema when he was receiving this so-called War Of Heaven what was happening to him

664
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
What was he looking at evening when he was getting that

665
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
Second target was

666
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
The actual Prophet himself at the time that

667
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,408
Not his perception for the time that he was receiving this vision

668
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,016
What was going on with him at that time that was a second so we can see like

669
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:58,624
How is he getting his eyes and imagine

670
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,976
And it turned out to be an alien abductions I think so I suggest

671
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,072
Is John of Patmos for talking about the author of the book of Revelation

672
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Kia

673
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
He basically

674
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Extraterrestrial

675
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
Around him and it was one in particular big guy

676
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,664
His head

677
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,528
And he was doing the best he could do was not in control of himself is not the best you could to try to sort it out

678
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,856
And when you got it when the whole experience was over he wrote a book

679
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
Revelation that's how we got it

680
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
And it really is that's how I got into all these other cultures apparently these humans to know about this

681
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
So then

682
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
We wouldn't be able to process it

683
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Okay

684
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,408
Processing if we didn't know that

685
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Also

686
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Bucked up

687
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
Clearwater

688
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,720
Coded into Revelation or something. Then

689
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
Tension

690
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
That's my topical referee

691
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
Prince for the month

692
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
Haha so I don't know man

693
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
This stuff to Annex

694
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Spent

695
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
Like it's funny

696
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
Because we're not idiots

697
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
I love you

698
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Oh man this is this

699
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Fun

700
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Storytelling

701
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
If you just think it is

702
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
But like

703
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
How am I going to

704
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Refute

705
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
The John of Patmos

706
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
How could you

707
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
Stroke

708
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
2

709
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Alien abduction

710
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,008
I love the way that he hit that I love the way that I hit that turn

711
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,360
Is it like because it starts with with your you don't like

712
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Closing his eyes and

713
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Imagining

714
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
Getting a vision

715
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
So what you're saying is he like

716
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,624
Sort of rhetorically knocks down the obvious

717
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Not all

718
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
It does it's not even his dad

719
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Azhag Jesus

720
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656

And stuff

723
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
Not even if there's a whole long

724
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Alpha

725
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
The amazing Randi

726
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Set out to

727
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,648
Debunk people who are making

728
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Pseudoscience

729
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Difficult

730
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Yeah yeah yeah

731
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
To get into like

732
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400

But he knew

738
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
They went through

739
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Completely tricked all of these researchers

740
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
And then they had a big conference about like

741
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
We are

742
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528

Be very

748
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
Skeptical about these ideas

749
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Without any

750
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
There's always been

751
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,448

Outlook

756
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
You've made me a lot

757
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Also the

758
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
Randy Foundation

759
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,552
I believe that's the name of it they give out Awards

760
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Not a great day

761
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
He sounds like a riddle a really horny

762
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Give out Awards

763
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
People who are

764
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
Get this award

765
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
But ironically

766
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
No

767
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
It's Pegasus

768
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
The Flying Pig

769
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
It's given out

770
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,344
For people who are the exact opposite

771
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
2003

772
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,000
Unwrap around there with Alex Johnson

773
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
But Alex was not present

774
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
During the space.

775
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
And we need to learn more about it

776
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
Why would I find out a little bit more about this

777
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
So

778
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
This morn heaven

779
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
What is a war between two

780
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
One was Donnelly living on Mars

781
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
And the other was living there were playing

782
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
Living on this other planet

783
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
People call Mal deck

784
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,512
About the asteroid belt that was totally destroyed in the war

785
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,072
And that's the word Nick depressed really

786
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,424
Apparently wanted us to know about him so they see that information

787
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Into our

788
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
Collective consciousness

789
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
Force-feeding the information and then they write about it in their Jackson

790
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
Long behold lyrics

791
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Become slowly aware of it

792
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
What do you mean the aliens

793
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Symbol

794
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
WhatsApp

795
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,096
So simple

796
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
You find

797
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
The profit

798
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,984
That you know is going to write a book that magic

799
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
The Council of nicaea it's going to make it in

800
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,128
To the Bible

801
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
We're not putting

802
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,760
The Bible that's funny.

803
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
YouTube on what the one where Jesus

804
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Raptors

805
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Right or the

806
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
The Book of Enoch

807
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Where they're like

808
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:59,072
Probably actually we you know ahead of time

809
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
It's going to get into the

810
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
The main book

811
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
What you do

812
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Deserve

813
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Cool special

814
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,224
No that's what he saying you saying they got a

815
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Where do they

816
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
Not though

817
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
We're going to get to it

818
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,648
It's not really an abduction it's an abduction like

819
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Scenario

820
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,280
Where he's standing on a lien comes over

821
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
Stop

822
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
He's going to explain a little bit more later but

823
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Before he does

824
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,776
Text clip where I Courtney Brown

825
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Bakes

826
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
I weird

827
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
It's fine

828
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Weird point

829
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
About the remote

830
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,808
I really want to mention it for me it's really important

831
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
These are millennials

832
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Hazelnut

833
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
People that came out of the military that were getting ready to retire or die or whatever

834
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
So

835
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
Having young people

836
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
Do these things and having a level of training

837
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
It is

838
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
This huge level

839
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Just

840
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
It's revolutionary

841
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,992
And it's really important for the future of humanity

842
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
What did you just say

843
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
I love him

844
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
You're going to go on such a rollercoaster

845
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Come on listen to him talk about

846
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,744
I'm just happy that's what is millennials

847
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,584
Likenesses this is way better than a New York Times article where is like

848
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
Millennials are killing the wine industry this was writing an article that's like

849
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
Millennials are resurrecting the crazy industry

850
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
There's two reasons why

851
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
He's more interested

852
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Millennials

853
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Why you saying

854
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
The things I say

855
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
One of the reasons that he's making the point of millennials

856
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
He wouldn't

857
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Cuz they don't have a lot

858
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Life experience

859
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
Young people are much more impressionable

860
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
Specifically if you're trying to start a cult

861
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
You probably going to start with

862
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
Didn't start with elderly

863
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
You casting aspersions on

864
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
People who are in the military

865
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Have this is going to

866
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Play out

867
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
Because you know who

868
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Kerry Cassidy sources

869
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Does General ER

870
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
X-Men

871
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,744
But still respect of the real

872
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
It's right so him bringing this up

873
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
It's kind of something that I don't

874
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Send Carrie it's real

875
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
He's going to push back

876
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
Kerry pushback Willits

877
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
This is going to be bananas

878
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,895
It is interesting because

879
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
Project Camelot

880
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Famous interview this with boriska

881
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,343
Who is a young boy from Russia who had total

882
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,183
Past life recall of his life as a soldier on Mars

883
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:10,047
Create floor here on Earth after that

884
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,191
The planet was I guess decimated so the surface of Mars and

885
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:23,103
As he describes

886
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
I guess some journalist

887
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,271
Heard about it and I'm in the community and then

888
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
At least this is how the story goes

889
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
Then started

890
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
To notice

891
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Of course now

892
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:46,143
We can't get ahold of her ass. Because he's probably working for the Russian government but none the less this

893
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,471
Parallel information

894
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,055
Another thing that he came across was they were

895
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,895
They actually we're trying to turn Jupiter into a second sun

896
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
It's something he said

897
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
That makes sense

898
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
Sure

899
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Whatever

900
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
I like the way she said generally speaking

901
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
Stars can become bigger Stars

902
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
I don't know about

903
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,463
Planets becoming centaurs

904
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
The stars all the time

905
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
I mean like horse

906
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
I don't know what

907
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
I don't I don't know enough

908
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
About the world as a whole

909
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Give me the gallon

910
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:25,311
I don't know enough but I do know that

911
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Dasani

912
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Planet I know that

913
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
The Sun is

914
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,223
Not a planet

915
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
Jupiter a planet

916
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
Turmeric into a star

917
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
I don't know man

918
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Class called

919
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,927
Astrology

920
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
I don't think this is the name of it cuz I think

921
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Comedians B

922
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:51,167
It's exactly that

923
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,239
Allergy free

924
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
I had to take it in college

925
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
It was

926
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
I still don't know what the

927
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
A professor's name was

928
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
But it sounded like

929
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
Professor Messer

930
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
That's all I remember about it

931
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
It was a wild time

932
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,111
I don't know a lot but I know that Jupiter

933
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135
Is not going to become

934
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,023
Confident

935
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
University

936
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
Another

937
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
9i used

938
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
To tell this friend

939
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,799
End of mine who I had from the neighborhood East tell him that I was an alien

940
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:35,199
That you have perfect recall from your past life

941
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
Another place where you around

942
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
I wasn't it was a it was a humanoid

943
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Into the

944
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
Basic tenants of

945
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Communism

946
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,631
Trying to tell stories to my friend of the plant that I came from or everything with equal

947
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Everyone was

948
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,007
Taking care of it up your friend animal

949
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,871
Mostly make it up later I grew out of it and I like Ike

950
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
I should probably stop doing this

951
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,039
Probably never told your friend

952
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,343
Never got a chance

953
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,183
Sorry

954
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:23,583
Know what I'm saying about all that

955
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Is that probably what happened with Mariska

956
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:32,543
As opposed to he's not working for the Russian government real world

957
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
Explanation for that now please go ahead

958
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,919
He is working for the Russians

959
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
Into the

960
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
He was the only one who saw

961
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,319
People would not shut up about

962
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Hillary's emails

963
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
That's why they talk to you

964
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,255
Robert David Steele

965
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
Stefan molyneux

966
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,095
George Papadopoulos

967
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Make your point

968
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,799
No I just love the way that you said That's How The Story Goes

969
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,175
Like when describing vraska's origin story of like

970
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Well he started out as the

971
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
The small boy

972
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
To his mother and then a journalist

973
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
Or That's How The Story Goes like

974
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
The part that she's

975
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Skeptical

976
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,951
Brightright

977
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
Uno's weather

978
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,727
There was a giant space battle on Mars

979
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
Probably fighting alongside Randy Cramer

980
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,127
Space Randy Cramer

981
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Send that I have to

982
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
Is easier Reptoid or is he human

983
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
Will get into a rapper

984
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,295
Episode unfortunately

985
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,439
Yeah it sounds almost I keep forgetting which side is the good one

986
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Because there are no good

987
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
So In that clip you start to see

988
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,839
We carry be like well

989
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,703
These are the things that I have figured out that she's starting to grow a little bit

990
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Possibly resentful

991
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
Hey boils over a little bit in the

992
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Text clip where we got our

993
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Easy to blow up a planet

994
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
There are lots of places on the planet where you have

995
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
Literally hundreds

996
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
High powered nuclear weapons

997
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
Stored in one spot

998
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
YouTube

999
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Enemies

1000
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
Nuclear weapon

1001
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
Nuclear capability this is this clip is a little bit longer but I

1002
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Secure them bickering

1003
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
It might be a good mic down.

1004
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
It's Cady as hell

1005
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,871
Is it happened the same way with l.ron Hubbard

1006
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
They have these

1007
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,711
Everything's cool

1008
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
It's Abby 50

1009
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
B-2 bomber

1010
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,855
Cesar bunker-busting nuclear weapon

1011
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,415
Right

1012
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,743
That just makes perfect sense

1013
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
Species you maybe Reptoid

1014
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
Made of course why wouldn't you build a bunker bus

1015
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,495
Is that you have a bunker-buster missile type thing that goes and blows up

1016
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,055
Stockade of nuclear weapon

1017
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:19,455
Let's keep Oliver nuclear weapons

1018
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,807
Gunshot it into one of those places and detonated it

1019
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
You really like me

1020
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Ignite all of them

1021
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
They all go up at 1

1022
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,791
Really easy to blow up

1023
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
Earth is an 8000 Miles

1024
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,727
All of liquid Molten

1025
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Lava

1026
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Just liquid

1027
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,127
I just got an 8 Mi thin crust

1028
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,431
On top of it like a grape seed

1029
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,319
Balloon

1030
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,415
To this I would like to remind him of volcanoes

1031
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Yep Oklahoma

1032
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Player

1033
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Earth is a lot like

1034
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,959
A grape seed

1035
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Yep

1036
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:21,151
Alright

1037
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
So if you took

1038
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,831
One of those repositories

1039
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:33,951
Hundreds of nuclear weapons and shot one weapon into it and detonated it

1040
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,047
Defendant

1041
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:47,775
You destroy the entire planet

1042
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,103
That's not what we scientifically know

1043
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
And and we also don't know

1044
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
You know I think there was a lot of way

1045
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,207
Using to destroy planets in fact I have some information from one of my

1046
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
Witnesses about that and if it does involve other things such as shooting a neutron star

1047
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887
Through the Wormhole

1048
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:32,319
It is not hard to blow up a planet and this is one way you could be done using current technology that we have

1049
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,719
Okay but that's also what you know as a surface human that's not necessarily what black projects

1050
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
Secret space

1051
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,839
Program are aware of and utilizing even to this day

1052
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:53,567
Is that most people would say blank a planet you can't do that

1053
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
It's just for Bridges reaching for the idea to explain the people it's not that hard to blow up

1054
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
Has this ever been you

1055
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Planet

1056
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,695
I don't know how to do this I think my hands keep slipping

1057
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
Turn off oven

1058
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
So easy

1059
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
Fresh

1060
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
I don't know about this

1061
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,103
Shooting a neutron star through.

1062
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,223
It's less important what makes ice

1063
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
Collapse

1064
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
A wormhole of itself

1065
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,343
It's less important what makes sense and what doesn't

1066
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Is more important is this

1067
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
Friction that we're seeing

1068
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,743
We've never seen Gavin

1069
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Be like look

1070
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
I am Morley

1071
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
Venue

1072
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,703
You're saying things that don't go in line with the Project Camelot line

1073
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
And I got a

1074
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
Polite but also shuttle

1075
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
You down on some stop

1076
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,383
Because everything we've ever

1077
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Oh yeah let's

1078
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,967
Panera

1079
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
Why not

1080
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Cereals Auto

1081
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
More stealing for the bra

1082
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,367
Coronavirus fights

1083
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Phuc yea Spider-Man

1084
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
Ian Holm

1085
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,231
Onboard

1086
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
What did you just say about f***

1087
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,887
Mars bunker-busting bomb to blow up a nuclear

1088
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Moron

1089
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Everyone knows

1090
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:28,031
The f****** neutron star in a wormhole

1091
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,823
From when we were fighting it

1092
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Vietnam

1093
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Courtney

1094
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
What you don't understand is I

1095
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:41,087
Other crazy people before you and they've assured me that they're crazy s*** is real

1096
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
If therefore I can

1097
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:47,999
Can't go along with your crazy s*** they are having a dominant struggle about crazyshit

1098
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Well I mean

1099
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
Of course the old saying is there's more than one way to

1100
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
I'm just saying this

1101
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
How you could do it

1102
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
If you were to do

1103
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,895
That sort of mentality of

1104
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,455
I got to push back a little bit Lisa

1105
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
Who carries Cassidy accidentally asked

1106
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
Most Salient question

1107
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Of all time

1108
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
Iveta Courtney

1109
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
He does not enjoy having ass out

1110
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:21,023
Was there any detail you know because there's this thing called actionable intelligence

1111
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,863
And sometimes I wonder if these remote viewing

1112
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Avoid

1113
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,703
Even on purpose giving us

1114
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,263
What what might be termed axonal

1115
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,151
Actionable intelligence things that could be checked out really that are very very hard

1116
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,735
Now you say there are some in some of these

1117
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
Things that were involved here

1118
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,111
Got to some degree have shown up in our cultures

1119
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,671
And so in a certain sense.

1120
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,231
Information that's validated

1121
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:56,351
Simply because it's been around for so long that something of that nature might have happened

1122
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
But

1123
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
Do you understand my question is here

1124
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Not really

1125
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Okay so the question is

1126
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,383
That these remote viewing sessions are giving you actionable intelligence

1127
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
I'm not sure what I would be mean by actionable intelligence

1128
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
Means that you can follow.

1129
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Define heart.

1130
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
Animal project

1131
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
A base tan

1132
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,983
Definition of intelligence

1133
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
No no it's not

1134
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
No it is not

1135
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
Ma'am

1136
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
Oh

1137
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Carrie asked

1138
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
The one

1139
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,223
Question that you are not allowed to ask on Friday

1140
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,295
Jack Campbell. Which is it

1141
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,135
The question

1142
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:55,487
I noticed from looking at a lot of remote viewing stop that it seems like it's almost

1143
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
Intentionally vague

1144
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,095
And unverifiable

1145
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Quick question

1146
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,935
From me Kerry Cassidy

1147
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
Is any of this real

1148
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,871
Our entire operation is

1149
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Call Leon real thing

1150
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,295
So

1151
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
It's been forever look

1152
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
Place that she is spent

1153
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,767
Entire life of

1154
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Which is the Skeptics

1155
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,839
Place exactly

1156
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,863
Batesville

1157
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Right

1158
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
She wants

1159
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Don't believe you

1160
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Believe in you

1161
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,543
What you know that your heart

1162
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Filled with

1163
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
Martian history

1164
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,271
Still pure paranoia narrative you have about the world being some sort of

1165
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,135
Describe it that's what she wants

1166
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
To perpetuate

1167
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,023
She's going out of her way because this guy is like

1168
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
I think she

1169
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
I don't know

1170
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
It's very weird

1171
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,471
But anyway she asked another question

1172
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,823
Just suggest another question that's actually really Saline

1173
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
They

1174
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
The human

1175
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
The humanoid

1176
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
Separate but equal

1177
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
Pitiable

1178
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:28,415
Humans on Mars

1179
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Mal Duke

1180
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,231
Whatever

1181
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Malbec

1182
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Answer that

1183
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
That was the end of this war

1184
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,751
There was a mass genocide

1185
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
So

1186
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,103
So

1187
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
If she has a question about

1188
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
I like how would that be

1189
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
The war

1190
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
Necessarily

1191
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Don't

1192
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
Courtney has a good amp

1193
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,183
Was the nuclear decimation on the surface of Mars

1194
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
A result in

1195
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
You know

1196
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
Payback

1197
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
The destruction of the planet when it blew up

1198
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
That apparently was the end of the war

1199
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
There's also the engine

1200
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
Good games tomorrow

1201
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,271
This may not be answerable I'm I'm just

1202
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,415
Why is if they know if you have a fleet of

1203
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,999
Army or whatever it is I'm not Army but

1204
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
You know above your head and it is attacking you and

1205
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,375
Their home planet is blown up

1206
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:47,263
He doesn't automatically therefore follow that the police suddenly band is there war and

1207
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:54,175
You're correct and certain are correct in that everybody just didn't stop

1208
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,039
You know for all intents and purposes you can imagine that

1209
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
After that

1210
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
People are just trying to sign find someplace to go

1211
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,743
I mean Marty really wasn't a very habitable

1212
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,303
Easily habitable place after that either

1213
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
Well that's

1214
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,703
Bro remember we talked about

1215
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
Exactly cuz you just said I see

1216
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,383
And we also know that there are many different races of reptilian

1217
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
You certainly

1218
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:31,807
It's Raining Men Planet doesn't miss. Didn't do a way with them you know that for a fact because we have monuments

1219
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
Reptilians

1220
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
You know

1221
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
John Oliver

1222
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
Isis was tasked

1223
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,023
According to one of my Witnesses

1224
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,423
Which is throwing a lot of the evidence in the Middle East of just that the reptilian domination of humans

1225
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
So

1226
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,031
So that we bring Isis into the fold

1227
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
Isis

1228
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
Places in her position

1229
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Create

1230
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Tudus

1231
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
Destroy

1232
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
Proof of rep

1233
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,807
Alien domination of Earth

1234
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
So if I understand correctly

1235
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Isis

1236
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Not gdubs is

1237
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Nope

1238
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
Reptilians fault

1239
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,511
Perhaps humanoids

1240
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Committing a mass genocide

1241
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,679
More fun

1242
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
As an explanation

1243
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
Fanciful

1244
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
It said

1245
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
It's really still just

1246
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
Trying to ignore the real

1247
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,663
We just got the last episode

1248
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Destruction

1249
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,551
You've laid on people

1250
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
Population

1251
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
I love that carries

1252
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
Wargaming

1253
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,951
Carrie's doing a carries doing our job

1254
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,255
What is this is a little disappointing

1255
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,303
I know that Carrie Campbell

1256
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,215
But she's been holding back all the time I'm only brings this out whenever she likes

1257
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
But I'm done with this

1258
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
The whole bunch of ships out there still

1259
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,319
That's why you blew up

1260
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:17,023
I might also that answers your question is too like what about Mars why can't you live on it

1261
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,375
Do the Fallout of the Fallout

1262
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,143
Is August

1263
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,191
His is answer of

1264
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
Well you know Mars

1265
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,799
Really a great place to live anyways yeah

1266
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Dad you might as well

1267
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
F*** off

1268
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Into a different plan

1269
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,175
Get up on a soapbox

1270
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
He's reptilians

1271
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
And so the question becomes

1272
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Did

1273
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
And this is just

1274
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,999
And for people to

1275
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:54,143
Into possibilities as to what this could mean so it's not just an idle thing

1276
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,447
Guero somewhere in the far distance

1277
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,799
Earthlings were attacked on Mars and that was how it

1278
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:05,407
Ended up looking like it does and basically they went to Earth after that

1279
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
Did follow we know they fall

1280
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,063
And we know they're here now and we also know that

1281
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,135
They have been here in the past because we have the carvings

1282
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
Sturbridge show

1283
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:21,023
In various societies which include stop America all over Sumer

1284
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,631
Egypt Iraq Iran you know serious pederasty

1285
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,679
So what I'm saying is

1286
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:34,591
May we look forward to another battle with reptilian sometime in our future

1287
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,919
Let me say this

1288
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,039
Indy Reads a lot of interesting questions of which I don't have

1289
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Okay

1290
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Fair enough

1291
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
Callahan

1292
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,887
All of my other guests

1293
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,079
Perfect human

1294
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:12,479
Allowed to be translated to my

1295
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
Will you don't have

1296
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,551
Is you don't know about the secret space program

1297
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Music

1298
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,207
Well obviously remote

1299
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
All of your other information

1300
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Is silly

1301
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
And if you believe the rest

1302
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,143
Believe he has

1303
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
Extra human abilities

1304
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,007
It suited his team what are you doing Carrie this is

1305
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
No regular surface

1306
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Psychic

1307
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:44,991
Just because your other fake gas to rid fake documents doesn't mean that they have some sort of grasp on true that this site

1308
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
It doesn't matter

1309
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,343
This is been there it's like since we started doing project

1310
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Camelot episode

1311
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
What is cuz I've always wanted to know what the

1312
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Carrie to go over

1313
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:02,655
To the other side something like this guy

1314
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Through the

1315
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
Xperia Z Theory window

1316
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,775
But now she's gone all the way to the other side of

1317
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Skeptical

1318
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
Conspiracy theory

1319
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
She's too deep

1320
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Mantooth gone native

1321
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,455
Next clip

1322
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Courtney

1323
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
Brown

1324
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Hey just dumb

1325
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
Jesse Ventura

1326
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,535
Set of harassing people

1327
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
There's a hole

1328
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
Lorde

1329
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,967
Under Area 51

1330
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
This is about the Dulce base

1331
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Kind of stuff

1332
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,111
Disconnected tunnels underneath like a bunch of

1333
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,695
Military installations Area 51 Dulce base

1334
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
Send apps at all come

1335
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,631
I didn't put it all comes from

1336
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Dude

1337
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Who killed himself

1338
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,727
It's a very tragic

1339
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,799
Big story if you look into the reality of adulthood

1340
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
It's

1341
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
Not real

1342
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,895
Very very sad

1343
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
That this guy threw his fake remote viewing

1344
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
Perpetuate

1345
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
How how that brain virus meme

1346
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Kind of work

1347
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
Like with John Pat

1348
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
John

1349
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
He was on

1350
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
No I'm talking about the guy from

1351
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
Uncle Johnny

1352
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
No

1353
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,959
There's no way that he could ever have imagined

1354
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Is that his

1355
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
Dumb allegory was going to last

1356
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
2000 years

1357
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,847
No

1358
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
Like this guy

1359
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
Invented the

1360
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
There's no way he would have expected

1361
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:02,207
Affected his he was just trying to make a living you just trying to make a living going right to UFO convention

1362
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,511
Selling fake little scraps of metal AB

1363
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
That's all he was doing

1364
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,327
Viruses

1365
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
So many people

1366
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,727
Once we wrap up this episode

1367
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
And even more fascinating aspect

1368
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Like

1369
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,567
The nature of this.

1370
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,847
Does he take off his

1371
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,431
Surface even Mexican reveal that he was a reptilian the whole time

1372
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,879
The deeper you go the larger the collection of bills people are

1373
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
Chill about reptilians by

1374
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,167
Military Witnesses in people that work in Black

1375
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
I don't know that though man I can just say what we have done

1376
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:00,575
Area 51 and we did find what we can described as reptilians are there

1377
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,159
They were not particularly friendly

1378
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,279
Committed

1379
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
I mean yeah

1380
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,631
If you believe that

1381
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,495
That's

1382
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
Swiss cheese

1383
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
Ridiculous

1384
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,383
I'm telling you so here's where we get to

1385
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,735
Starting to not believe it I think what I've described is like

1386
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
Point of no return

1387
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,831
For the two of them at

1388
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Staffing Partners

1389
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,951
And then they can take the information that we have at the Warren Heaven which is at

1390
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:42,047
Information from any other one single source

1391
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,423
So I think this is going to eventually change

1392
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,495
The tone of all of these discussions we don't need

1393
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
Speculate so much

1394
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,103
And guess we can say okay Lee spino this much

1395
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
And based on this much

1396
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
We can start asking

1397
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,807
People that do no more governmental sources things like that or more information

1398
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
You're not going to get this information out of the military

1399
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,183
The military works for the government

1400
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
They don't run the gout

1401
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
You have to

1402
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
The military

1403
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
Disagree on whether they run the government or not and whether our president is actually

1404
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,519
Present because there was a military coup

1405
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
So I'm not going to go there at the moment

1406
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
That's not true

1407
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
Sisyphus interview

1408
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:34,783
But I do appreciate you know what you're you're talking about and I certainly agree that this

1409
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
I do think that

1410
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,599
The viewing

1411
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
You are it adds to assertive a Litany of information that I certainly have gotten from Witnesses

1412
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,303
He did work for the military

1413
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Uber

1414
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
That's so on

1415
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
Oh s***

1416
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
That's so fucken

1417
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Comfortable

1418
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
In a Land of liars

1419
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,079
Yeah it's really interesting 12 Liars butt up against

1420
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Really

1421
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
Cuz it does go down to like

1422
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,223
Who's asserting Domino

1423
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,271
I'm trying to

1424
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,295
Assert

1425
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Ipassive lazy version

1426
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
Dominance

1427
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
Over each other

1428
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,463
She's going to win every time

1429
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,535
Fox news interview

1430
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,887
All I like this is whatever Fox News brought out whatever

1431
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,703
Silly liberal voice that would go on there

1432
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,287
Yeah represent liberals

1433
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
I like it as a strategy

1434
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
She's going to get it

1435
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
40 minutes

1436
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
So the interview was fine and then

1437
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,647
Took a turn somewhere and I'm not entirely sure why

1438
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
I think it was when he said

1439
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,463
It's the military

1440
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,791
When he was talking about the millennial

1441
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,351
Videos working for him I think that was the truck

1442
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,911
No because he in the ain't talkin about the millennials

1443
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,495
Disparage the idea of all right

1444
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,895
Spell against the Pendragon

1445
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
Carrie's rap

1446
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
Sochi

1447
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
I think that guy was

1448
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Play the military

1449
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
At this point

1450
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
You start asking questions

1451
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
From the message

1452
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
Cuz there's a live stream going

1453
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
What I thought was

1454
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Particularly

1455
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:32,287
Last question someone wants to know if you have information on what Ed dames

1456
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
Call Patel shot

1457
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,919
Ridiculous idea I've ever heard in my life

1458
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,967
I don't even talk about it

1459
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Alright

1460
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,343
Okay well it's been great again to talk to you

1461
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Do you know about it

1462
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,047
So

1463
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Remote viewer

1464
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Flames

1465
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
I'll just list awesome

1466
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,311
Movie caught stealing fertilizer from us companies

1467
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,383
He said that the existence of Satan will be proven by science

1468
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
Monsanto covers both of them

1469
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,271
He said that Bill Clinton would be killed in April 1998 on a golf course by lightning

1470
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
He claimed to know he was replaced by a change

1471
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,159
They claim to know the exact location of Amelia Earhart

1472
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:24,511
Explain Madagascar a cylindrical object

1473
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,583
Containing deadly fungus spores released by an alien intelligence

1474
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,863
Heading towards Earth and 9th

1475
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
1998

1476
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
That was the satellite Act

1477
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,751
Beat fungus that

1478
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Would spread to the Americas

1479
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,591
A motto

1480
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
Killshot

1481
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Yes

1482
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,967
This was a late 90s

1483
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
He predicted a series of powerful deadly solar flares

1484
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,831
Determine the killshot would impact the Earth

1485
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,367
And wipe out civilization

1486
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
Queen 2011

1487
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
2013

1488
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:53,951
So it didn't

1489
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
And

1490
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Wait what

1491
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,655
Didn't happen it's one of those things that really is used as an invalidation

1492
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:07,007
Remote

1493
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,031
These claims were like

1494
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
Didn't come

1495
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,591
Druid

1496
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,919
Still seen as like a legitimate

1497
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
Part of the remote viewing

1498
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223

This person bring that up is a hey go f*** yourself

1501
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
Courtney Brown

1502
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
He's through that

1503
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,511
That was an answer back in the day I'm

1504
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,791
I'm sure that the two of them

1505
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
Tongue

1506
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
They were

1507
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Contemporary

1508
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:38,751
So the largest remote viewing facility on Earth

1509
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
If you don't know Ed

1510
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
No

1511
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Lay down

1512
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,151
Libertyville to the end of the Project Camelot episode

1513
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
But it doesn't bring us to the end of our epoch

1514
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,223
Oh no

1515
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,783
So I've been withholding a certain piece of

1516
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
Information from

1517
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Wait

1518
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,111
Did Carrie go on

1519
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,159
No

1520
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
No

1521
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,535
This is all still in Project Camelot world

1522
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,375
So I went to the farsight website

1523
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
I want to farsight. Org

1524
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,775
I mentioned some of the things that he was

1525
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
Involved

1526
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Courtney Brown is involved in

1527
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
Remote viewing you know you have the Hitler thing

1528
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,455
You have Martin Luther King give Area 51

1529
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
911

1530
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,783
These are listed on his website as the

1531
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
The project

1532
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
Climate change

1533
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,671
Giza Pyramids

1534
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,695
Reptilians

1535
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
There's one thing that you do

1536
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Left

1537
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
On his website

1538
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
It is a very big

1539
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
To discuss it

1540
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
I had to go back

1541
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
And find an episode

1542
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
From 1990

1543
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,335
Yeah alright

1544
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
In November of 1996

1545
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
Courtney Brown

1546
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
Went on

1547
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
Buy with Art Bell

1548
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
Coasttocoastam

1549
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
To talk about the

1550
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Hale-Bopp

1551
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
Yes here is the

1552
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:07,839
Obviously there's something to this object is 4 times approximately 4 time

1553
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,631
Let me be clear you talk about the

1554
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Trailing Hale-Bopp

1555
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
This is based on

1556
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,471
Fraudulent image

1557
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
Do they have come out

1558
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
In the day of

1559
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,079
This episode in November of 9

1560
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,383
Trailing Hale-Bopp

1561
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
We're going to get to it

1562
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Size of the planet Earth

1563
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
And it's headed our way

1564
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,719
I don't know how your clerk awake is but I'll start right now

1565
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:40,095
Wherever they're going to organize ourselves

1566
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,679
Galaxy out there there is sending all the Galactic Federation the council

1567
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:50,079
And I prepared.

1568
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Anastasia Galactic Council or some higher order watching very interested

1569
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,319
Are there watching a hologram on the phone

1570
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:06,463
Like watching election returns or something they are all seated around a table in the Subspace

1571
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,023
Looking at something

1572
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,071
Like that

1573
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,423
Very sweet about that event which may be happening

1574
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
Going in a Direction

1575
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,239
Which is not

1576
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:23,871
Direction which is not evolutionary but only time

1577
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
I will tell and I

1578
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,455
Time is of the essence

1579
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
And many things are happening

1580
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,903
Is accurate description of the subject

1581
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
Well I'm not sure I want to hear coming from more accurate after coming

1582
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:50,495
I'm on page 11 and I want to make sure I cover the most important stops on

1583
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,567
Okay I won't remember anything else

1584
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
Check really important

1585
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,991
Immediately

1586
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
Something spinning

1587
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:06,111
People on the ground here

1588
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,415
Batman looking up

1589
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:13,023
I mean ideas Restaurant originated looking up in the sky looking at some structure

1590
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,143
And there was also something going on in Subspace communicator

1591
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,423
Fundamental

1592
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
There's a message being sent

1593
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,799
Someone who is listening but not hearing

1594
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
It is essential that

1595
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,759
Description of persons wake up and listen now help will be there when he died

1596
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,343
Somebody a message

1597
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:43,487
Interpretation of its Collective

1598
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,303
The message is being sent to us

1599
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:52,447
When listening but not understanding this message coming from this object

1600
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:56,799
Yes and it's also been coordinated by the larger Galactic Council

1601
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,383
When was the

1602
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:01,919
I don't know that

1603
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,711
But I do know

1604
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Wedding March

1605
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
87

1606
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,831
We're going to need to cross-reference this

1607
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
He just described the

1608
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,135
The plot of the

1609
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
The fifth

1610
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,951
He didn't describe it as remote

1611
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
Viewer.

1612
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,791
Let me take a look here

1613
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
1997

1614
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,095
Holyshit

1615
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,167
So he predicted this plot of The Fifth Element

1616
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Call

1617
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,983
Don't f****** know

1618
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,055
Gary Oldman is no longer my favorite actor

1619
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,847
You're missing the forest for the

1620
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
The trees

1621
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Courtney Brown

1622
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
Is the reason

1623
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
No

1624
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
You got

1625
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,063
He's the reason that the idea went around that

1626
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,343
Spaceship was following

1627
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
The Hale-Bopp Comet

1628
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
I thought he said it was an odd

1629
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,183
Check the size of Earth

1630
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,743
It's a huge spaceship let's go to the next clip

1631
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
Who is a large object out there

1632
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,119
It apparently is

1633
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,655
Tunnels in it

1634
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:58,751
Illogical artificial and natural in a sentence that has

1635
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
Rock

1636
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
As well as

1637
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,079
Mantua

1638
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
Humongous it's absolutely large

1639
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:11,551
And it apparently moving in an artificial in artificial man it's not moving like a normal Celestial body mean

1640
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,087
Under control

1641
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
A vehicle

1642
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,951
Four times the size of the planet Earth

1643
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:24,351
Is a big eating thing one thing one thing about the eighties that when they decide to put on a show

1644
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Plano theater

1645
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,239
Laemmle Theater better than anything on Broadway for me

1646
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
You understand what I'm getting at here

1647
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,991
Courtney Brown he's been right the whole time about everything

1648
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
Courtney Brown

1649
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,575
The guy that we've been going over

1650
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,367
On this episode of project

1651
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
2000

1652
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Now

1653
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
What episode of Project Camelot

1654
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
No s*** in 1996

1655
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
He went on Art Bell

1656
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
And basically

1657
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,959
Through his remote viewing b*******

1658
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
Created the idea of

1659
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
The spaceship was

1660
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Was following the Hale-Bopp Comet

1661
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
Was picked up by the Heaven's Gate cult

1662
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
And led to the deaths

1663
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
39

1664
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
What

1665
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
Yeah

1666
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,783
He was the one who killed the Heaven's Gate people

1667
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,623
You know why you know why it happened you know why it happened

1668
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,719
It's not all his fault although he's playing with fire when he plays games

1669
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,791
Like that the entire idea of Heaven's Gate with

1670
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Level

1671
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,887
And if there's going to be like we're learning lessons

1672
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,423
Skier and there's messages from

1673
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:36,799
Space that we need to listen to the way he's presenting it on this episode of Art Bell

1674
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,335
It just so happened

1675
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
Typically Falls in line

1676
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
With the teachings that Marsha

1677
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Applewhite was

1678
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,991
Put putting forward to his flock

1679
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,831
This idea that like what he says in this episode

1680
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,111
Everhart Peltier

1681
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,159
He's like oh did you like

1682
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,439
This space

1683
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,463
Item

1684
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,487
Space object

1685
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
What the messages

1686
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,071
We are hearing them

1687
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,143
But there's an individual who needs to listen

1688
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,703
How could Marshall Applewhite not

1689
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
End up like

1690
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
This is

1691
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
So clear that he got all this

1692
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
From this episode of Art Bell

1693
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Really

1694
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,895
Nobody knows

1695
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
When did

1696
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:19,039
Well I was sleep

1697
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,623
Do you want cuz it was right around when the hell by,

1698
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,439
March 24th

1699
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
26 + 90

1700
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
297

1701
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,511
Cuz they didn't ship

1702
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
The idea

1703
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
That you needed

1704
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
To like the idea of Hale-Bopp being

1705
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,191
Part of it and the I'd of the object

1706
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,239
Floating behind Hale-Bopp

1707
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
And the suicide stuff

1708
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,079
Was it not a part of their cult for the

1709
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,615
Proceeding 20 years

1710
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,967
No she Heaven's Gate existed for a really long time

1711
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
Before

1712
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,551
Becoming a suicidal doomsdayco

1713
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
Call

1714
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,367
Company

1715
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:59,231
For a while

1716
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:05,119
Tire Source or something like that was the name of the company like great at it you understand

1717
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Like

1718
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,679
Good the reason that I I'm

1719
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
I'm bringing all this up

1720
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,495
There's literally no way

1721
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
Way to get around the idea

1722
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
That

1723
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
To be your crazy dude who was a cult leader

1724
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
And his teachings matched up

1725
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,456
Entirely with what this guy

1726
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,992
Went around and spit

1727
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,320
On Art Bell show there's an obvious one to one

1728
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
That he listens

1729
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,392
To this episode of Art Bell

1730
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
And that's where

1731
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
He started the

1732
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
Come up with the ideas

1733
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
That lead

1734
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
To the

1735
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,072
I mean people

1736
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,424
No it's not this is everybody

1737
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,008
Just before he made reference to it on that podcast about heaven

1738
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,384
It's really good people should listen to it

1739
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Even as I was listening to

1740
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,224
Did this episode of

1741
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,760
The Project Camelot

1742
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
Pieces together

1743
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Courtney Brown

1744
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,392
Was the guy in that episode of Art Bell

1745
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,672
From 1996

1746
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,976
Who created the entire mythology

1747
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Around the idea of it

1748
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
Wood spaceship

1749
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
Coming

1750
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Behind

1751
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
Bananas

1752
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,144
Just made this up

1753
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,704
Yeah like there's no other recorded

1754
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
Situation

1755
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Before this other than of course

1756
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,288
I know of

1757
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:22,688
Well other than the guy who wrote The Fifth Element who have a remote

1758
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,480
Fraudulent pictures that were

1759
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,760
Serta doctor it up

1760
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Courtney Brown

1761
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
Set Art Bell

1762
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Some pictures

1763
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,208
Forgotten

1764
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,744
From a anonymous

1765
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
Astrophysics

1766
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,328
Telescope

1767
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
Turned out they were doctor

1768
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
Pictures from

1769
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
The University of

1770
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
Quiet

1771
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,264
Absolutely prove it

1772
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,872
Uses to say

1773
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
2

1774
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,480
Pictures work

1775
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
He's caught up

1776
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
Elaborate

1777
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
That ended up

1778
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Being really

1779
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,160
Really f****** day

1780
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
Crazy now granted

1781
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,792
We can take a step back and we can really realize that

1782
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
The situation

1783
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,144
If you look into what was going on in the heavens

1784
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Navigate called

1785
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
Word dangerous

1786
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
I already

1787
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:21,312
No matter what there is there is a chance

1788
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,640
There's a chance they were going to end up committing suicide

1789
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,712
Obviously at one hundred percent

1790
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
Sent fed into it

1791
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,368
But also Cults generally don't and

1792
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,696
Until there's a satisfying narrative for the leader to play out

1793
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,720
Like

1794
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,792
The only reason they'd Jonestown ended the way it did

1795
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Is because

1796
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,888
We got to pull it

1797
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,168
Where is

1798
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:52,032
The story he would have probably rather lived out with them at suicide would have been slightly different

1799
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
Unless forced

1800
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,592
And rushed that it was

1801
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,664
You know what I'm saying with Jeff couch

1802
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
This episode

1803
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
Of of coast to coast

1804
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,040
100% gave Marshall Applewhite

1805
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
The

1806
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,088
Narrative

1807
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
And gave the idea of like

1808
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,672
Oh s*** this entirely

1809
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:12,512
Different 20 years we've been saying that aliens are going to bring us to the neck

1810
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,816
Next Level we have the story

1811
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,096
This is a professor

1812
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:19,424
There's a professor who's going on this show he has a doctorate

1813
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
He's no slouch

1814
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,216
What's

1815
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,592
Political science

1816
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:32,224
But we have one more one more year from back in 1999

1817
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
They're really drive home

1818
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,832
And like this is the stuff I was listening to earlier

1819
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
I got nauseous

1820
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:43,744
I need to listen to many people will not be around

1821
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,912
Many people beings

1822
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,960
Interested

1823
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,544
7 is is underway with regard to the Subspace,

1824
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:03,968
For the entire decoding process

1825
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:10,368
What does that mean

1826
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,184
Structure infrastructure were looking at up in space

1827
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,840
It's got some information it's kind of information

1828
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:26,240
We have to keep our plan our Escape

1829
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,824
They have to deal with

1830
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,176
So what's the Subspace realm of life

1831
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,456
It's open to interpretation

1832
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,760
To the point where a cult leader

1833
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
Who was

1834
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,112
Very frequently and now

1835
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
Of the heaven

1836
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,024
You know everybody is art really that's not

1837
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,328
Who we are there's a sub-level our souls

1838
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,376
Red Rabbit

1839
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
I don't know how to put a button on

1840
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,264
But like

1841
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,312
When we talk about

1842
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,616
The Project Camelot stuff

1843
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
It's super fun cuz it

1844
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,664
It's f****** stupid

1845
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,456
But at the same time

1846
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,016
The episodes about Mark Richards in the Raptors

1847
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
And stuff like that

1848
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,064
He's a murderer

1849
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
He's a f****** murderer

1850
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,160
Why don't you understand

1851
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,304
Episode did super fun about Courtney Brown coming on and talking about how he has figured out

1852
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
The war in heaven

1853
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
Then we can laugh and have a lot of fun with that you look at his past

1854
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,192
He's response

1855
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:30,496
Not responsible but he had his hand

1856
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
The death of

1857
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,360
39 people in the end of the Heaven's Gate cult

1858
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:39,200
I guess that stuff

1859
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,760
Do you understand

1860
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,064
And I get it

1861
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,624
My problem is

1862
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,672
Is a micro version of

1863
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Religion

1864
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,560
Like my problem is it's a micro version of the worship of guns in this

1865
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Country Vet

1866
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
Like what

1867
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
But that's why I'm not

1868
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
I'm struggling

1869
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,616
Yo I'm struggling

1870
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,152
Any kind of discount

1871
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Kind of emotion

1872
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
No connection to this

1873
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
Because it's

1874
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
Relatively speaking

1875
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,576
In the grand scheme of all of the reason

1876
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,112
These people murder a s*** ton of pea

1877
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,440
Objectively Hilaire

1878
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:25,024
Well I guess if you're if you're in the Heaven's Gate Club

1879
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
If you're in the habit

1880
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
My favorite okay

1881
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,984
So I had I had the bottle

1882
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,008
Exited out his crate

1883
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,568
We would debate things now

1884
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,616
And I have limited sympathy

1885
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
Heaven's Gate

1886
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:44,224
People I'm not I'm not I'm not interested

1887
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,272
Playing

1888
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
That's not the conversation I'm having

1889
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,368
The conversation that I'm trying to bring

1890
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Is

1891
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,696
They are very serious concert

1892
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,256
For people who play these sorts

1893
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
Crazy games

1894
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:58,816
You know what I'm saying

1895
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,584
There are

1896
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,888
There's a real world

1897
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
Fantasy game

1898
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
That

1899
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,752
Kerry Cassidy is playing

1900
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,032
On Project Camelot

1901
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:12,128
If you scrape beneath the surface a little bit with a bunch of the people that she has on

1902
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
You fine

1903
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
Their involvement

1904
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
In very dangerous

1905
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,760
Whether it be a murder

1906
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
30

1907
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,368
Perpetrated on Coast to Coast AM

1908
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Said into

1909
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,952
A ritual mass suicide

1910
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,512
So so if we take from that Annex

1911
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Extrapolated

1912
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,096
Jerusalem isn't that big a deal

1913
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,912
I didn't say that

1914
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
Jerusalem

1915
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
You heard it here first

1916
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Not that big a deal

1917
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,360
You lot like Courtney Brown

1918
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,944
Jesus was the Courtney Brown

1919
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,480
Of the Bible that's what I'm going to say

1920
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Alright

1921
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,296
By AP the answer

1922
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:55,392
The other point that I wanted to make you can have stuff like this

1923
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
In your past

1924
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
You know people

1925
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Know about it

1926
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
And

1927
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
It doesn't matter

1928
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
No it doesn't

1929
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,888
His behavior in 1996

1930
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
Should legitimately disqualified

1931
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
From anybody listening

1932
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
To him ever again

1933
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
He has a website

1934
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,568
An Institute

1935
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
People in

1936
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
Training in remote viewing

1937
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,432
Which cost them a lot of money

1938
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
For the training

1939
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,736
I don't know I didn't

1940
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,760
Get an exact figure on it

1941
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,808
But then he also sells his

1942
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
Bulshit

1943
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
Channel 2 movies

1944
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,904
Do people buy it

1945
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,464
Cuz people are into this f****** ding dong world

1946
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
And I look

1947
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,072
I'm not coming down on people being interested

1948
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
In

1949
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
These sorts of topic

1950
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
Like some stuff like that

1951
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
I'm coming down on the idea of

1952
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Of Canard

1953
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Using it

1954
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
So easily

1955
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,312
And there being no

1956
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
Like most of

1957
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,408
The people who watch Project Camelot probably don't know

1958
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
This part of Cameron Courtney Brown pissed

1959
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,528
They probably don't know March Mark Richards was

1960
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
The Pendragon

1961
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,320
They don't know these

1962
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,368
Well the Millennials didn't grow up

1963
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,720
Right and everyone

1964
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,536
This guy has a doctorate he probably knows some stuff

1965
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,864
I've heard of remote viewing before it's probably real

1966
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,144
And therefore he gets to

1967
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,680
The play out his cycle again

1968
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:15,008
Right and whatever comes of a lot of this remote viewing stuff

1969
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
You could end up

1970
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
I mean you just got to be careful cuz you're making

1971
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Stuff up

1972
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,176
And some crazy person might hear that stuff that you're making up

1973
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
And run with it

1974
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,992
And that's exactly

1975
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
Amazon

1976
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,320
Does the crazy stuff he makes up

1977
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,088
People run with

1978
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
End up harassing

1979
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
Shooting up puppy

1980
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,768
Two again one of the things that

1981
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,792
I feel like

1982
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,864
Justifies our and of course I have to have so

1983
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
Some sort of

1984
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Things that justifies

1985
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,960
The way that way

1986
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
We attacked

1987
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,496
Alex Jones

1988
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,776
And project

1989
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,800
Is because

1990
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,104
These guys are the weakest link

1991
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,384
Con artist

1992
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Exactly

1993
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,712
You know like

1994
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:57,760
Alex Jones is the weakest link of the

1995
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Conservative propaganda

1996
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,088
He's so clearly and obviously

1997
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:08,000
Force Unleashed BlogTalkRadio probably whatever all the sudden now

1998
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,816
You have the tools to see through all of the other day

1999
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,096
Conservative propagate

2000
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Yeah because

2001
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
You can tell they're using the same

2002
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
Exactly

2003
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Just left obvious

2004
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,336
Camelot

2005
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,152
Of the game

2006
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
What is

2007
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,992
And anytime you hear stuff

2008
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:29,760
Like this

2009
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,576
People consider for a moment that they might have

2010
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,880
Incredibly checkered past

2011
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Staff hoaxes.

2012

Also shoutout to dr. poodle Papa in the chat room

2014
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,008
Not super early in the episode

2015
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,568
And then I'll bring it up

2016
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,896
Podcasts

2017
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,432
Heaven's Gate podcast

2018
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,248
Recommended

2019
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,784
With the caveat

2020
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
That via the host

2021
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,624
David is a two-bit Jazz weirdo

2022
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah I listen to it it was it was

2023
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
Compelling audio Lee

2024
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:19,424
Orally the story and the research and it is amazing really interesting but

2025
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Buried if

2026
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
Cat got out

2027
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,592
It wasn't bad it was just it was like

2028
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,664
You listen to NPR for more than an hour you start to lose your

2029
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:34,016
Tarak Mehta

2030
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
We made our point

2031
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:41,696
Be careful all religions are wrong

2032
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
When you hear things

2033
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Careful

2034
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,632
Especially nowadays but like that

2035
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,984
So I will I will

2036
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,544
