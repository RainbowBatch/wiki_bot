1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Joe

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
For you sure

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Your bright spot

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,984
Today is

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
So I have not taken part in

11
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Too much

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Like ordering

13
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,432
Food from Plato's sure sure sure I've tried to keep that limited

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,504
Expensive

15
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
But I realized that I hadn't had Taco Bell in a long time

16
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
And so I decided to order some Taco Bell delivery reliving those comic days

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
Something

18
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Could do

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,912
Pizzas delivered Chinese food delivered

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Yep yep

21
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
So that was kind

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
But I noticed

23
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
Something on the menu that I never seen before it was like

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
Can aged cheddar chalupa

25
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Chalupa

26
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,528
What kind of thing but it had like cheese

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,648
Tiago

28
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,232
This is our Artisan aged cheese

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Ambitious

30
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Very pretentious

31
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
But I had to try it

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah you got to

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
And

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
It was

35
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
So good

36
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
It was also terrible good

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
I got it as a call out

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
Crunchiness of the cheese is really complementing

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
What are you doing hi falutin ask Taco Bell

40
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,392
The Great British baking show enjoyed it quite a bit and you know

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
If you got to find you got to find the light where at

42
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Exist

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,888

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Star Wars

46
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
Have you heard of Star Wars

47
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,616
The one with the Enterprises prize the guys they have a uniform

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
I got a little things on his head was now ruining our world

49
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
I don't know

50
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Mandalorian

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,464
Huge fan watching it

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
Conversation

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Oh yeah

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
Should I try and guess it I think you should

55
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Okay

56
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
Pete new really close though

57
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Roku

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
Grogan very close to pee

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
Roku Roku I know it's baby Yoda forgot that's a Star Wars name

60
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Forever

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
Grow glue no spoilers

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,208
Oh that's not a spoiler egg you find out that was last at

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Behind

64
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Forget Brogan you're like us baby

65
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192

Not my growbiz

67
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Aspects

68
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
Not so this episode most recent one

69
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Character came back

70
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
Who made me extremely

71
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Extremely happy and in a very lovely way

72
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
The second season has been basically like you remember what you did

73
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't want to I don't want to be like

74
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Addictive in case it's right

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Put my

76
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Instinct is to joke that it's Jar Jar Binks

77
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
No

78
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
S*** where was I

79
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Oh yeah the second season has been fun dip

80
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
You know it's the sugar stick

81
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
Check that you're dipping and more sugar to eat

82
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Buy everything has been

83
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Junk food

84
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
And it is been

85
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,743
Incredible and I love it so much that metaphor falls apart is fun dip sucks

86
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
Sugar overload because my point does sugar even as a kid I didn't want any

87
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Cubs fun dip

88
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
Sky chewed on that stick like it was my

89
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
Milk-Bone in miraculous stray dog

90
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
Exactly well I'm glad you're enjoying that

91
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Feel like

92
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
My plan is

93
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Watch the Mandalorian once there's like

94
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
Like five seasons of it all

95
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
I have this

96
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
TV shows like I want there to be multiple seasons of it that I can bend

97
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Cuz if I like it

98
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,351
I don't want to stop watching who was no Netflix was the first

99
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,471
Play stood like just released the whole that was it like Daredevil or something that was the first show where they're like

100
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
We're putting all 12 episodes out

101
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,359
And I've never I'm no longer able to watch episodic

102
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Television

103
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,991
It started earlier than that for me or at least like the

104
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,879
The challenge of it I think it's cuz what I would do is I would come to shows light

105
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,023
Prick bye-bye like people saying this is the best day ever

106
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
Trick by these Liars who Delights

107
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
A lot of Television is reliant on

108
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
Cliffhanger Enon Center

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,311
Especially hour-long dramas if you're watching it week-to-week

110
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Like deep

111
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
Experiences that is so much more engrossing attic

112
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Can trick you into liking things

113
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Is that you don't actually like all that much true

114
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
So I always try and give things a little bit of time get a little space until like lost I started in likes

115
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
Season 4

116
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
And the experience of watching

117
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
In the prior three seasons like

118
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
All in a row

119
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
Was that pretty gratifying that I hated it for the 13 episodes to get into it

120
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
Imagine if I started watching episodically I'd watch the first episode be like

121
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Yeah you know

122
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
Got to love you say I'm good but it would be a different

123
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Movie harder

124
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Television

125
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Bottles of change

126
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Yes this is us

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Commentary

128
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Cultural

129
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
A tomato

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Jordan today we got an episode

131
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Forever now

132
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
I started listening to the episode with Rogan Alex's interview for

133
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,591
Hour-long interview with Joe Rogan

134
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
The first minute

135
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
Policy real questions getting into the nitty-gritty of universal basic income I made it like

136
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
15 minutes in as like I'll do an episode about this eventually probably but like so annoying

137
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,047
To give you some contact list

138
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
He asked is it like

139
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
At what point did you realize that

140
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
That you were like

141
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
Really famous but you can do whatever you want to do

142
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,847
That's a great question through something along the lines of like

143
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
You know what I like about smoking weed as it makes me think about more in

144
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:52,319
Interesting fact

145
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,255
So I just I didn't have it in me to do that to this episode so we're talking about Thursday and Friday on the Alex Jones

146
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Program already

147
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Going to see if he's going to

148
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Continue his ideas about moving

149
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
DC and living at

150
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Spoiler alert no updates

151
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
Didn't even mention it

152
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
I'm thinking about it more than him

153
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
The books of signed up and reporting to show us

154
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231

Website knowledge or

178
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
You could do is you could take that feeling of generosity

179
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
You can put it into the Rock

180
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Launcher that you have a fix

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Next to your back

182
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Directly on top of your

183
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Rocket pack

184
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
Pack of course shirkin been down

185
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Just a little bit because of rocket launcher affixed to your back is a terrible idea to pull your scope up and you fire that

186
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Rocket launcher

187
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Into the Imperial cruise ship

188
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,391
Whatever charity that you are looking for

189
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
No it was not

190
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Good alright

191
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
Jordan today

192
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
December 3rd

193
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,631
Not a great episode December 4th there's a little bit more going on

194
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
But I did find

195
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
A delightful out-of-context draw

196
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Which I will share with you right now

197
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Jennifer flag hero

198
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Constitutional lawyer Patriot

199
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Turn the Jedi

200
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,807
Star Wars see it all makes sense.

201
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231
I love the idea that Alex is a constitutional

202
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade as a constitutional lawyer float

203
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Weirdly

204
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
I think that perfectly sums up Alex's show

205
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
The person he's calling a constitutional lawyer

206
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,735
How dare he maintained that he's not that into Star Wars outside of a b****

207
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
We start on third hiiraan

208
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
I I kind of maybe

209
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Glance this off the first time I heard Alex discussing

210
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Horor bringing up his little fat

211
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Factoids but I decided this time

212
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
It would be best to look into it and

213
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Discuss

214
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
What was going

215
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
2000

216
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
777 people died

217
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Yesterday

218
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
They're saying from covid

219
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Covid related

220
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
90

221
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
6

222
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Percent

223
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
False

224
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Positive

225
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
So we heard him say that on a previous episode but I think it was in the context

226
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,743
Do something over there were bigger things going on, it'll be better side

227
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Steve bulshit spell the German courts must be brought into that alright

228
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Let's see what happen

229
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,167
Student stories a little bit more complicated than what Alex is saying

230
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
What's at the core of it is that

231
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,663
Court determines haha was it for German citizens who were in Portugal on holiday were held illegally

232
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
When they were quarantine

233
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
1:18

234
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Tested positive for covid-19

235
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Exotic Portugal care

236
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
It wasn't a German Court

237
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,159
It was Portuguese now I think Portugal

238
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,303
One of these vacationers tested positive and wasn't close contact with the other three so the Portuguese authorities quarantined them in a hotel

239
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
They can test it this

240
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Decision ultimately judge

241
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
I just found that their quarantine was unlawful

242
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Part of the evidence that was used at their trial was related to a study that claimed the PCR test or up to 97% unreal

243
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
Liable cause that ratio of false positive

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
However and as always the case Daddy

245
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Is not what the study said

246
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
This was a piece of me clinical

247
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Just diseases Journal which looked at what is known as the

248
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Cycle threshold of testing

249
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
And how that could be a way to better understand viral load in the possibility of infection

250
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Samcrac

251
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,399
According to this article the consensus had previously been to understand someone is not contagious

252
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
After 10 days

253
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
And a viral load that

254
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
They cannot be identified with a cycle threshold value of 30 or higher

255
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Sure

256
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
From

257
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
13100

258
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
61 positive samples

259
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
1941 were chosen

260
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
And tested using different cycle thresholds

261
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
To see how

262
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
The early estimates

263
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
Held up a miserly assessments

264
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
They found it with a cycle threshold of

265
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
25

266
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
70% of samples were still positive

267
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
It's like oh threshold 30 that number dropped

268
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,191
21 cycle threshold was 35 the number of positive results were less than

269
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
3%

270
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
In the publication they literally say that this finding

271
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
Using more data than their original set

272
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Does not significantly changed

273
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
The conclusions that have been reach previously

274
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
The finding essentially boiled down to a feeling that after 10 days if your PCR test

275
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
Is that a negative without under 30 threshold

276
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Icycle threshold

277
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Then you're almost certainly not going to be contagious

278
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
This is not

279
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Proof that the

280
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
PCR test are always false positive nor did a German Court decide

281
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
The test is a scam

282
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Alex has no idea what the

283
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
The story is about nordaas even

284
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
No but the study that underpins the story

285
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Even with this information

286
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,431
Using the cycle threshold value to infer whether or not a person is possibly infectious

287
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Is not a precise way to interpret these

288
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
These figures and some people definitely worn again

289
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
There are a number of other variables

290
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Consider but the talking point

291
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
That's been taken from this publication and disseminated on right-wing media

292
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Is a PCR test

293
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Has been proven

294
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
German courts

295
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
To be a false positive rate of 97%

296
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
The complete Bowl

297
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,263
The court in Portugal ruled that the vacationers have been illegally detained based on their inability to find any indication

298
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
Of what the cycle threshold that was used in their paws

299
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
Test result was

300
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
In court they could not defend their positive diagnosis

301
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
Sure this was a case that was mishandled by Portuguese Authority

302
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
He's not an indictment of test

303
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
For covid-19

304
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
I also just

305
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
Whenever you said that last time

306
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Is a global pandemic

307
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
That affects a lot of countries

308
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
I don't care if

309
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Germany

310
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Is like

311
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Germany's court system can't be like

312
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
They're all full of s*** and I'll buy it

313
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
I just don't

314
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
I just don't care there are other

315
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
There's other countries

316
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,639
Yeah I don't like I buy it I found another

317
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,711
Story that I thought what was what Alex was talking

318
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
I'm about there was a lab in in Germany

319
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
That process I think in one month they process

320
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
60 tests

321
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
And 58 were false positives

322
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
And the reason was because there was a

323
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Supply shortage

324
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,351
And they they're normal reagent was unavailable

325
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Compatible reagent

326
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
And the mistake was was found in like

327
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Okay

328
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Yeah we do all this

329
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,335
But like the I bet that was what I kind of thought would make sense

330
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Historians I call this

331
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
This is clearly

332
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
German courts

333
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Portuguese

334
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
German vacationers in Portugal

335
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
And it's a misrepresentation of what the court decided

336
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
And the study that was being

337
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Introduced

338
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
So

339
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Decides about

340
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Coronavirus

341
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
I don't trust

342
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Most courts

343
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
Impartial or know what they're talkin decided that I'd like to

344
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
See ya I'd like to I'd like to read it

345
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Some Heroes

346
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175
Bird people

347
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Who are staying open

348
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Despite

349
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Covid

350
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
Popular restaurant and bar

351
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
New York New York

352
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Maybe next year

353
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Essential

354
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
The police arrest you

355
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Autonomous

356
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Tommy's

357
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Police

358
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Our number one here

359
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Says this guy's name wrong

360
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
It's not Danny pursetti it's

361
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,215
Little bit of a turn between when he recorded this episode in when we were recording our it's okay

362
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
On the night of December 5th Danny presti was arrest

363
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,871
But it wasn't for keeping his bar open as an autonomous zone or some s***

364
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
According to NBC4 New York

365
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
Quote New York City Sheriff's office said deputies attempted to take Danny presti

366
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
E34 into custody at just after midnight Sunday

367
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
After observing patrons

368
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Entering Mac

369
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
Public House via and empty commercial space next door

370
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Upon identifying themselves

371
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
The sheriff's office said presti allegedly fled on foot

372
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
Got into his car drove into one of the deputies

373
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
And then continued driving with the inter Deputy clinging to the hood

374
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
I think

375
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:53,151
I think that Alex would like to paint this is a situation where this guy is just like and I got to put food on the

376
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Table rental

377
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
It got the car

378
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah that'll do

379
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,439
Anyway from the heroic story

380
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Fighting back against

381
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
The government's that attic

382
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
Control4 closing It restaurant in the midst of a pandemic try not to

383
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
Yeah yeah

384
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
It's going to be an interesting story to try and weave these small business owners

385
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
They worried about them

386
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Netflix show you

387
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Michigan

388
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
The business owner comes up and takes over the local L'Occitane says listen

389
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
You're forcing me to fight

390
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
We went to drop

391
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
We try to log on thousands of times over.

392
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
20 times a day

393
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
And I wanted you to see if we can get it

394
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,687
So what would you like

395
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
That's sad

396
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
This is a disgrace for a couple reasons

397
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,183
The first and most obvious is that the stimulus that was given out in the management of it was entirely up to his hero.

398
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Trump and his

399
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
If Trump in the GOP

400
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
He controlled it been willing to provide more support for the people who are struggling

401
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
Then the stimulus probably would have been much larger

402
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
April's government was it all concerned with governing and

403
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,567
Incompetent leadership then the website that Alex had trouble using probably might have been better

404
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
The people that Alex supports

405
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
Send deifies of the exact people who could have averted the problem that he's complaining about but Alex refuses to acknowledge

406
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,135
It's just so f****** Republican to destroy the country and then be like sea government can't work

407
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
The second problem is that if Democrats had been in charge and a robust stimulus package had been passed that allowed

408
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
How do small business owners to comfortably survive this Health crisis

409
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Exactly be super again

410
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,007
Pants that I hate the idea of a social safety net

411
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,335
If these business owners were being paid to close temporarily

412
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
To deal with the virus

413
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
Be proof that the nanny state was trying to make all business owners

414
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
Depended on them to survive

415
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,623
In a situation like the one we're in there is nothing that leaders can do that will appease the s*** head fake populist like Alex

416
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
You got it if they pass massive spending bills

417
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
To take care of the public

418
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:18,559
It's proof of a communist conspiracy tried to pacify the population order makeup surfs

419
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
He's a dope ass massive

420
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Spending bills to take care of people

421
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
It's proof that they only care about Jeff Bezos

422
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Switch is proof that it's a grant

423
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,311
Conspiracy to make you dependent on pesos which will bring in communism or something

424
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
This is the part of Alex's politics

425
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
The Trap

426
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
The Joke is on You if you take

427
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
Seriously because he doesn't give a s*** about any of this

428
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
He's the most

429
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Totally satisfying to yell about

430
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
The small business owners were hurt by the shutdown

431
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
What is principal

432
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
Any other response

433
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:50,559
Crisis like this the only thing he can actually Advocate is acting like there is no virus

434
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Which sounds better

435
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
When you just presented as yelling about the

436
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Sportbusiness

437
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
I agree though the business owners happy

438
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
October

439
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
Business case

440
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,639
I don't think there is like problems with some of the disc

441
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
Descriptive things that Alex's heart that I'll just never respect him

442
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
To speak on the subject

443
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Because he's not a

444
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Sincere or Genuine actor in this

445
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
It always work

446
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Whenever things are going well

447
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Relatively speaking

448
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
Republicans who likes this is there could be going better if we just didn't get got away with all this right

449
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,752
Regulation and s*** people alike

450
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
And then by the time we're here

451
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Four years later whenever we're not going to have one

452
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
They switch their tuner

453
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Why hasn't government done anything for us

454
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Alex is the only person

455
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
That forces me to

456
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Constantly say like

457
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
How dare you

458
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
Kind of overused in boring Alex doing that makes

459
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
We just go

460
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,656
Yep I think he's the only person because he's the only person we look at this

461
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Smart lights

462
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,800
I bet if we covered Russian 800 other people a day

463
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
If we didn't show about Rush Limbaugh I guarantee you

464
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
Do you think how dare you

465
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
So on this on this day Alex's

466
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Is pretty excited

467
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
Because he has that Rogan interview already recorded

468
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
And

469
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
I think it's been my contention and

470
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
What's stronger than a

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Contention

472
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
CertainTeed

473
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Yeah

474
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
Certainty Works positive

475
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Alex's using

476
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Joe Rogan

477
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
To try and appeal to a wider audience

478
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
Event he has access to

479
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
It's just outright says so

480
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Where are some of the highlights

481
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Coming up

482
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Tower and then

483
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Or so

484
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Foreign policy

485
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Millions of years

486
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
2340

487
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Free Taco Bell

488
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
This is a great way

489
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,576
To reach out to new people that I know I don't look at Alex Jones don't look at the Joe Rogan to it so this is a powerful

490
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,928
This is an important thing to understand that this is why Jose kind of being used

491
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,072
That Alex has a pretty Keen awareness that you know people look

492
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
If it's Joe but they won't look at it if it's me because I'm Luna

493
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Now

494
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
The issue for me comes down to

495
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Do you remember

496
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
Pretending Joe's listening now

497
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
You remember when Alex was screaming about your kids on are Sneaky Snake I do

498
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
He was going to destroy you

499
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Globulin

500
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
Remember all that stuff

501
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
That was when you were of making yourself available to be used so way are not wanting response to

502
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:07,168
When you got on your show and I can't have Alex on because this hooks

503
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
Oh you said you he was not somebody who your platform was available to he talked about your

504
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
Kids on his show

505
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,272
Do you know your platforms available to him you're going to come

506
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
You live in Austin going to come on his show he gets to use you for publicity now all of a sudden you're not a sneaky snake you're one of the best

507
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
I have a history of unhealthy real

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
Is that what you wanted to hear

509
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
Apparently obvious could this be like

510
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Look

511
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
We knew it

512
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
He knew it

513
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Maybe Joe is the only person who

514
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
It doesn't know it but he probably knows it too

515
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
He has the most awesome mentality

516
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,528
Because the night

517
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Yeah

518
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
At the same time whenever he said it I was like well that's

519
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
A little

520
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
That's a little guy

521
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Here's the deal I'm trying to use this dude to Trojan Horse by extremist views on to audiences that no better than

522
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Linda listen to me

523
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,472
Look we all know that but it's tacky to say it right

524
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,800
I had a nightmare the other night

525
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
I know that

526
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
It's also not great

527
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
To talk about dreams

528
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,176
And it was that our show disappeared

529
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Because of like

530
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Copyright

531
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Issues

532
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
Yeah I know this is fair use that using Alex's

533
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Stop

534
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
But it's still something that worries me is like hey is there possibility that you know we could have all of our episodes

535
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
Give him ideas

536
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
So it's too late cuz on his show he gave us

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Permission to do this

538
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Everything I do with free air

539
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Copyright free

540
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Meaning that

541
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
You can take it

542
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
You can share it

543
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
We had so many emails are so many letters by

544
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504

Alex Jones Infowars

00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,376
My barn is looking a little worn down

552
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168

Forza park on the side of its Alex I wanted to paint in pores on my barber was worried about getting sued

He's got the paint cans

556
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Rob Rob

557
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,280
You know how we're all call Robert Barn we will do anything and everything for free publicity

558
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,608
But this one time I hate Barnes

559
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
That's what it is

560
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Robert Barnes

561
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
And I hate Barney

562
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Maybe that's what the person was asked

563
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Information for it

564
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,688
And Alex has permission to

565
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Barnes was an employee

566
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,368
So like I said Rogan is making

567
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Himself available and helping Alex get it

568
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
Attention and so that means that he is Brave

569
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
He is a big Brave boy

570
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
And

571
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
It turns out that

572
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Tucker Tucker Carlson

573
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
While his rhetoric is good he is

574
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,728
Not somebody that is going to have Alex on his show

575
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
So he's not as good as Roku

576
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Pikachu

577
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,944
No one else in this position is

578
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Weezer friend

579
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
But

580
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
I need to plug in for down there

581
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
Nobody's been willing to go to bed for me

582
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Oh no

583
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
I got told

584
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
UFO

585
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
This call

586
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,808
Even in your imagination you number two

587
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
How about that

588
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:27,776
Thoroughly fictitious person that I didn't bed right now are you voice in my head

589
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah Alex is Public Enemy Number Two

590
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
I don't even know

591
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,760
I would be interested to find out if Biden actually even knows who Alex Jones

592
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,112
I would imagine there's a possibility

593
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
I think the people around

594
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Biden would know

595
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
I don't think Biden

596
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,816
Has ever actually been like I don't think they even need to broach the subject like

597
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
He might have gone like hey who's this

598
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
Alex Jones character in Glisan

599
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
You don't need to worry

600
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Here's what I would say

601
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,800
He is as aware of Alex

602
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
The Property Brother

603
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Belly soundtrack

604
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
And there are a couple of

605
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,296
I've seen them somewhere I don't know what their show is about

606
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Smiling I guess

607
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:17,952
Yeah I would imagine that it's kind of like Alex's existence

608
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,256
But probably has now it no idea

609
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Let's b b my scent

610
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,120
I would prefer if Alex Jones data Property Brother

611
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
What are we just fix

612
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Houses on TV

613
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
The best

614
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
The exact

615
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
Same amount of work

616
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Someone called him and said that the doj

617
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Under Biden

618
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Come after you

619
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
There's a possibility

620
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
They're trying

621
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
To get Alex on to the

622
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
The team

623
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
I want to be given immunity

624
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
From God

625
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
My music library much

626
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
All looks so inviting

627
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,336
All the money all the private jets all the best medicine

628
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Boats

629
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712

Corporate lawyers

634
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Kill the firstborn

635
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
It's disgusting

636
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey Rob.

637
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
Quite a while

638
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,488
God you can just you can hear him looking at the clock

639
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
Totally

640
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
Bridge

641
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
20 seconds left

642
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
Cigars back in stock

643
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,616
They try and steal me away from you guys and the only thing keeping me from them

644
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Is your money

645
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm going to stay in this fight as long as you're giving me money to but let me tell you I have offers that others would kill their children

646
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
4

647
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,160
Here's what I'm telling you I don't have your money

648
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm on their team

649
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
For money

650
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
Sounds heroic

651
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,912
And the doj is not going to come after you

652
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Scalpel

653
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
So Alex Goes to commercial after talk about Frost

654
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
The guard and man

655
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
He loves that song A Bad to the Bone

656
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
Did I would say that it sucks

657
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
I would say and I'm sorry

658
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Do you like that tonight

659
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,600
It's so droning babababababababa

660
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
That's what I was saying

661
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
The song

662
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,512
Alex Alex is listening

663
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Loving it

664
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
F****** loves it and then he has this weird Fanta

665
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
What just happened

666
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:42,752
Love you. Dad

667
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,336
What

668
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
I got a message

669
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Alright

670
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,528
Learn the wrong lessons from things

671
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,136
His career was like

672
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
You're driving irresponsibly

673
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
You knocked off the road by

674
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
My happen

675
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
Santa menu

676
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
Is irresponsible if pecan going

677
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah I would say that's a

678
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,288
I don't like why not just keep on driving down the desert road

679
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
120

680
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
It's a fantasy that Jack Rabbit does not have to be there I mean I guess stories aren't interesting without conflict of some sort

681
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
Do you have to have a I guess this is more of a man versus nature kind of

682
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,904
Steamatic of I would also say

683
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
With context

684
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Cookie man versus self

685
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
That could be a good

686
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Exactly

687
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,680
So he wants to take some time here on this episode to play clips

688
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Of his Rogan

689
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,080
Interview bring that into the show itself

690
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
But there's a problem

691
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
There's a problem

692
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Copywriter

693
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
No

694
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,272
Editor those clips

695
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
And I got this big front clip

696
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Out of the 49 minutes

697
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
Are we come back

698
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Tomorrow maybe

699
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm not sure we we there that

700
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
But

701
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
There's there's so much more

702
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
To get to her today

703
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
So many angles

704
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
Job

705
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Forecast

706
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,088
1 clipper

707
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Because

708
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,840
The only Power

709
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
This point

710
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Every time we do this

711
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,472
I like a lot of political news

712
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Tip of the spear

713
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
We get that done

714
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
Dot-com

715
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
Newswars.com

716
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
And so much more

717
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
To fund this operation

718
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Face

719
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:16,352
We need your support a lot of lot of water address

720
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
I do it

721
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,264
Appreciate the idea that he saying like Okay with these things happen the only Power I have is to give up

722
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,592
What kind of means like I run this whole thing and I'm going on

723
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Strike against

724
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Best Buy support

725
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
How dare my subordinates

726
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
What

727
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
What are we doing

728
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:38,880
What's the problem now wait they gave me more options that I had requested overachievers

729
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,464
Eclipse

730
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
I can't possibly be bothered to look through and choose the ones I want

731
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,144
To use know I must on air throw a tantrum

732
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Strike

733
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
This is the type of

734
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Stuff where you go you know what

735
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
A lot of people think this guy is a lead

736
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah the only

737
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
The only thing I have left to me is to give up

738
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
In the face of adversity

739
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Challenge I say

740
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
No in the adversity is like

741
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
Something you could sort out during a commercial break

742
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Yazoo

743
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Just pho

744
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
Hey guys could you pick up a couple of those cups for me and then just send them over real quick

745
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,472
Evil is up against this guy is like this guy is the dude he was like

746
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
Going to stand up to the devil I'll be like

747
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
I guess I could just inconvenience him a little

748
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
Maybe this is the devil doesn't even have to destroy Alex or any kind of elaborate plan he could just make his life a little annoyed

749
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,088
Like fuk it I don't care

750
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,928
Flexing on saying like see this is how much better than you I am I'm going to pay

751
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Alex

752
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Jones's your

753
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
Immortal animated

754
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,120
Strowman winning the Tag Team Championship with a twelve-year-old child

755
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,728
We got going up against Ivan Drago

756
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Mr. Magoo

757
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Quite a match

758
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,360
That'll do it so Alex does finally gets

759
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Some clips of Rogan

760
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,528
Probably going to have to do this as an episode do but like

761
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Bee sounds

762
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
So f***** up

763
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
Just in this one

764
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Quit they play

765
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
God

766
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
I understand

767
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
Be reluctant to Everett

768
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Or

769
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
Multiply

770
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
But

771
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
It's been shown throughout history

772
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
The simplest way to combat.

773
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
Is the shutdown

774
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
And you're in you say

775
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
You got to go to bed

776
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Use water to go to bed

777
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Can you go shut up

778
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
It's sort of the same thing

779
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Dad

780
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,072
It's a crazy interview for Plus hours long a lot of leaves a lot of surprises

781
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
Yeah

782
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
I guess Jose

783
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,776
Replying and that clip that you should debate your child

784
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Okay

785
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
Well also in that

786
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
Contact your framing yourself as

787
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
The child

788
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
And the parrot does make the rules

789
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,856
So the bedtime is the bedtime

790
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Analogous

791
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
To being kicked off social media

792
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
You're going to abide by their bedtime

793
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,584
Where you fall asleep or not it's on you but you're going to be in that bed

794
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Because

795
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,728
Could Barrett's in many ways one thing that you are learning how to be

796
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
He is a member of

797
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,336
Society insofar as your actions affect others

798
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,664
Weird Amanda in the same way

799
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,968
The people who are doing this b*******

800
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
Children

801
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Society which means there are rules

802
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,904
Yeah yeah I mean

803
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Not the way he wants. It might work a lot better than

804
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
One of the reasons that they sound

805
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,656
Sound so f***** up in that clip is like

806
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,704
The audio

807
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Doesn't sound right

808
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
It's either

809
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
Sped up slightly

810
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,408
Like I don't know what it is but it doesn't have the same tone as Joe's voice normally does

811
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
So I don't know what it is I think somebody messed that up

812
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
And now he probably

813
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
Just has better sound people on his own show like I said the first half hour 20 minutes of it

814
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
That doesn't sound like that

815
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
No it's

816
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
There was something wrong with

817
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
The the replay are there

818
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
But yeah it's like

819
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Well the only option we have here. It's a give up

820
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:39,520
God who is this is the level of like kind of like amazing interview they had were there like

821
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
Don't yell at your kids

822
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Just go to bed

823
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
I can't wait

824
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,432
County for four hours of that see what you got to do is be like

825
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
I hate kid

826
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Tell you about

827
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
You got to do with me

828
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
Did you get into the bedroom you lay in bed

829
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,464
You fall asleep if you don't do that you're going to hell

830
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
If Joe's point is that like

831
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
Parent should explain to a child who's curious about why there's a bedtime why it healthy

832
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
I need to go to bed

833
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
What if that's the case

834
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
If he wants

835
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
How to make that equivalent to like

836
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Social media platforms

837
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Should be a little bit more trance

838
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Apparent

839
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
I'll go with you

840
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
But I also don't think they like

841
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,320
I don't think the decisions that have been made or not like kicking Alex off

842
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,880
Like that

843
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Overturned by transparency

844
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
Also I would like to know Alex is Takeoff

845
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
Whether or not he explains bed

846
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Bedtime very clearly

847
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Curious math

848
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,752
The 4th now and here's hoping that this is a leg up

849
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
Duration of Donald John Trump and we fight back.

850
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Ambulance Now red handed in all five states with the red-handed video

851
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Eagles

852
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Devastating

853
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
His hands on those East

854
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,280
Uber

855
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,864
Can get his hands on them but unfortunately you know he doesn't have

856
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
The power oven like an entire government

857
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Behind him

858
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
I get really

859
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Bored

860
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,384
Of a lot of this Alex

861
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,968
Repeating and amplifying like Rudy Giuliani in Hudson

862
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
I just

863
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
How are you

864
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
It's exhausting

865
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Yeah it's exhausting

866
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Go home and bleed your hair dye there

867
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Alex's big news

868
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Was that

869
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,560
I would like on my route

870
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Iowa

871
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Hours last night

872
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Call Megan

873
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Honda.com

874
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Fashionphile.com

875
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,527
Brittle, Breitbart because they're really start to drop the ball and turn against

876
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
Very disgusting but I guess that

877
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Very sad

878
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Fannie Flagg

879
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,719
Think about that a little more why don't you

880
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
What does it imply about Breitbart what is it Apple imply about

881
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:18,239
Is that it only produces

882
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Content-based

883
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
Stephon what billionaires would like huh

884
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Interesting

885
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
Also what does that imply about like things like parlor

886
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
Your social media Network that you really seem to like that has bunch

887
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Mercer money

888
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,135
It seems like they would only allow things that the Mercers would want

889
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,767
Like use that as an attack

890
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
On Breitbart because they're out of pocket or whatever complicated

891
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
I would leave it alone

892
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
That's that's like

893
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,823
Following the money in it investigation like

894
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
If you follow the money you're going to get corrupt politician

895
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
It's going to happen because they are

896
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
So don't follow the bus

897
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
Do you know what happens with corrupt politicians was that

898
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
They put ballots

899
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Black Kray

900
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
MMA

901
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Corrupt

902
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
One of the stories

903
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Hundreds

904
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,143
With video in dozens of cases

905
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
Of the fraud

906
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
People looking over their shoulder

907
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Everybody out

908
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Channel water

909
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Broke

910
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
That's what you're overturning

911
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
Sylvester when he's caught with Tweety Bird mouth

912
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,695
Start running the sons of b****** and then it turns out they're all night mode

913
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,023
So this is the video that Rudy Giuliani had entered into his evidence

914
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
Does proof of illegal votes being counted in the Georgia State Farm Arena

915
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,423
It was alleged that these were secret legal Bala

916
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
That were produced from black boxes when no one was looking

917
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
The surveillance video was reviewed by election officials who said that there was literally nothing abnormal about the video and that these were illegal

918
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
No balance

919
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
If the

920
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
If the material the Box

921
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
It is made of Camp Beam on now

922
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
Why not make the ballots out of Gabriel Sterling the voting systems manager in Georgia said quote the 90s

923
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,327
Second video of election workers at State Farm Arena purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety hours of foot

924
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,423
Georgia Secretary of State investigators

925
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Normal ballot processing

926
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,359
Once again we have Trump's goon trying to manufacture of voter fraud narrative out of the

927
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,895
The appearance of something that they think

928
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Look suspicious

929
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
The fact that they keep doing this and each time at 2

930
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Turns out to be nothing should make his followers weary the next time Rudy or Alex find some

931
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
Supposed to irregularity

932
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
But some people fall for multiple Doomsday

933
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
Like predictions

934
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
There's no towel

935
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,863
12

936
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,983
Okay it's December 20th it's on December 21st math again

937
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
2020 100

938
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,591
Guys come on follow me for the next hundred years

939
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
That will be all right

940
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Yeah

941
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
It's just it's exhausting

942
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
And I think

943
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
These are thin and

944
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
I just

945
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
I don't know

946
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
Play lose my page

947
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
Covering the same topic over and over again

948
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
So I was very excited

949
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
To hear that

950
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
Tilapia pad

951
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
I don't know

952
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,823
The point is is that he did say

953
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
That the mafia did not exist

954
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Testimony

955
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
In the 40s early 50s

956
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
That the mafia

957
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Did

958
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Not

959
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Exist

960
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,463
The reason the J Edgar Hoover was in denial about the existence of the mafia was that at

961
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,815
The time the FBI was basically entirely focused on investigating alleged communists

962
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
It's surveilling left-wing activist

963
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:02,751
He didn't see going after Mafia actors as a good use of resources and organized crime could be difficult

964
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
The prosecutor

965
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
And they were rich

966
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
So they could bribe people

967
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
Give people money

968
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
If you want them to

969
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:19,391
Left if Alex has been around in 1955 he would have been

970
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
Stickley supported the FBI leaving the mafia alone thing there just go to Mercado businessman

971
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:32,191
Come on a bigger issues like a literally everyone I don't like is a communist they do you got to be spent

972
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Seneca time on

973
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,847
God-fearing Catholics over here just trying to make a living in the new world and

974
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,943
You're going to ignore them and you ever go out to the copies that's what you do

975
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Motor light

976
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
So Alex is like you sitting there talking about these globulus

977
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
They're a menace

978
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
They wanted to populate

979
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,159
Everybody don't kill off the entire world

980
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Babe

981
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
But the globalist

982
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
They seem to have like a

983
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
The gun to their head

984
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
Alien gun

985
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,679
But I realize this sounds silly

986
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Yes no

987
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Far more dangerous

988
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Absolutely

989
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Yeah but it's

990
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,223
Do to your head if it went just the

991
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
You realize this sounds a little silly

992
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
In the middle

993
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Kamikaze

994
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Somebody's got a gun to the Head

995
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,815
Populate your planet

996
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
Hey Marlon

997
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Okay

998
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Colonel I don't know

999
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
I just we can't figure out why

1000
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Pretty sure that a lie

1001
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Can't have a gun to you

1002
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,695
To their head

1003
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,767
I just go I grow so tired of thee like

1004
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,167
Trying to save face by being like I'm not saying aliens but the Bible says yes

1005
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
What about

1006
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:14,847
You believe everything the Bible says so the Bible says is an alien you're saying is an alien

1007
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
The next question I'd like to ask

1008
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
If you were to present this in my in my present

1009
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
So you're saying

1010
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
Movie the next question

1011
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,535
Wild Bible says

1012
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
I'm starting to feel like we could do this for a while

1013
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:42,751
Alien gun to their head but they're also the people who James Bond

1014
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031
The villains are based on

1015
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,103
I don't know if you know that look

1016
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Why does dr. evil look like

1017
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,735
Because Hollywood nosey people look like

1018
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
Or

1019
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063

00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
Have you ever seen the island of dr.

Add pivot

1048
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,303
I'll bet it gets even worse cuz I was just talking about this process

1049
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
The guard that's back in

1050

I think you might be f****** around and getting himself Suited

1051

Meadows great for women too

1052
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
But okay

1053
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
Medical doctors should prescribe saw palmetto

1054
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
Because literally

1055
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,599
Wait what did you say what did you just say

1056
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
Minerals for

1057
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
You

1058
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,631
What's great about that is that part of the Enders I'm not advertising it is in the middle of it

1059
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
99% chance you won't

1060
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,151
Get prostate cancer if you take saw palmetto

1061
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
Wow

1062
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
Illegal defense whenever they like okay well you said this and he's like no

1063
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
See

1064
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
I don't know

1065
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
I think that's illegal

1066
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
Anyway

1067
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
I got to worry about buying okay good because

1068
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
But you really have to worry about is Kamala Harris

1069
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,727
Okay she's actually going to be the president has she's a woman in their far more threatened by women

1070
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,775
Especially women of color than they are

1071
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
The of white man

1072
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
I think I think that if you really got

1073
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,479
Granular with it you got Alex into like a psychiatrist office psychologist office maybe this is something

1074
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,575
You could tease out eventually but no on the surface it's because

1075
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
Is just going to let

1076
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Imma Be

1077
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Then decide so much and

1078
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Clip that Alex plays

1079
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,815
Dementia

1080
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,167
He talks about stepping down he doesn't do it come out

1081
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,495
All kidding aside the first lady to be told me she holds

1082
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
Yes she does

1083
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,311
But not with the cheesecake

1084
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,151
The side

1085
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
It's a matter of

1086
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
The thing we are simpatico

1087
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
Our philosophy of government

1088
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,111
Sympatico on Highway 10 attached

1089
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
I don't have any

1090
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
When we disagree will be just like

1091
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
Microsoft

1092
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,375
Kitchen private she'll say I think we should do A B C or D

1093
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
And I'll say I don't I like a don't like

1094
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
I like I told Barack

1095
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,335
Especially if I read something where there's a

1096
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,407
A fundamental disagreement we have based on

1097
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
Jamal Prince

1098
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,623
We don't have the time

1099
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
We discussed at length

1100
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Coliseum

1101
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,023
Speak Polish on intelligence

1102
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
Disingenuous

1103
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
Alex

1104
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
When he was

1105
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
Was Obama's vice president

1106
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,247
They had sorta private disagreement over

1107
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
Minor issues

1108
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
And if there was a

1109
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Substantial thing

1110
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
Becky Wood

1111
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,719
Gracefully bow out that wouldn't cause

1112
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
Psychological damage to the cont

1113
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,839
That is not saying that if he disagrees with

1114
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
Kamala Harris

1115
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Substantial issues

1116
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
He'll fake

1117
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,543
Moon in Terraria then she'll become president when I was vice president

1118
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Yeah

1119
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
And I didn't have any Act

1120
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
She will say over what the final

1121
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Decision wise

1122
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,527
I would give my input and if I've found the final decision unacceptable

1123
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
I would not throw a tantrum I would be like

1124
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
I can't do this yet I'm no longer Vice

1125
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
I find that to be in

1126
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Incredibly mature

1127
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Position

1128
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
That like yeah

1129
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
You know

1130
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
What is being

1131
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
Discuss their

1132
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,823
If you want to apply it to the present

1133
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
It would be

1134
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,967
Harris will step down if there is a fundamental disagreement between the

1135
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,039
That's pretty much what he said yes

1136
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
If we were is

1137
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,111
Because he wasn't president before

1138
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Story is based on

1139
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
When he was president

1140
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
What a dick

1141
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
Yep speaking Addicks

1142
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,911
Somebody who's a real pile of s***

1143
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,239
Can't stand his voice is so annoying

1144
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
God Tom pepper

1145
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
National file is bad

1146
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
And he's he's bitching this

1147
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
Conspiracy weary

1148
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,455
This woman and her daughter in Georgia

1149
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
We're like

1150
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,551
You know that they switched ballots

1151
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Some stuff

1152
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
I like he's going to f*** around and get

1153
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,719
But like in a Freaky Friday situation that it was like a magical evening and they touch

1154
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
In front of a

1155
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,863
I don't care about what's going on they have not presented evidence that rises to any level of

1156
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,167
Suspicion is that it is just like

1157
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,983
I want you to play this clip because these dudes are trying to get

1158
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
UCF

1159
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,847
People in the video and everybody's wondering who the heck

1160
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Ruby Freeman and her

1161
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Daughter

1162
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
Supervisor while she works on the election she talks about people complaining because

1163
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Because her supervisor is getting

1164
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
Instructions that do

1165
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
She says well that's just how it is

1166
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:13,311
Supervisor well Alex her daughter happens to have

1167
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,639
Blond dreadlocks that in a Greenie secure

1168
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,735
Braids her daughter is the woman who

1169
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
The suitcases

1170
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
And then

1171
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,415
Once everybody was gone because of the leak

1172
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
Night

1173
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
People to count

1174
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
This is an elaborate

1175
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:43,007
Conspiracy McGee is directly accusing people of

1176
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,407
Anti name I think that if they these two people this mother and daughter

1177
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
Feel so inclined

1178
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:57,087
I think they should probably sutapa portray showcases outrageous 100% because the consequences

1179
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,671
Probably take a lot of time at Avion necessarily

1180
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Difficult

1181
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,975
And a pain in the ass

1182
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
But

1183
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,071
The potential consequences of the actions that people like Alex

1184
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
And Tom are doing right here

1185
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
Are so severe that they deserve

1186
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,959
Got some sort of a contact

1187
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Parts for it

1188
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
I just can't believe they would do this

1189
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
This kind of

1190
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Two people I can

1191
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Yeah I guess like

1192
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
I mean

1193
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
They just have such

1194
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Bloodlust

1195
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
They just really do

1196
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
Like I literally like

1197
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
Not only are we saying this person

1198
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
Persons named hoping they

1199
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Get deathreats

1200
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
This is

1201
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
This is what we want

1202
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
You know and it's just self

1203
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Yep

1204
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,119
Stop stranger over there who I'm going to

1205
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,423
Exploit and maybe get killed

1206
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,775
Tom is on

1207
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
In a lot of ways

1208
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Basically convinced

1209
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
The Trump is going to win these cases

1210
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,175
Saying that he's going to become

1211
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
The really what I should have said

1212
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,879
But also the legislators are starting to move in the right direction

1213
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:09,023
These people Alex these are the modern

1214
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:16,191
These legislators and legislatures are the new founding fathers of the new country that's going to be under

1215
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,079
Legislators have also been an agreement with the whole lock.

1216
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Call B.

1217
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,127
Arkansas

1218
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663
Hear this one

1219
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
We're going to go back

1220
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Exit Aaron down there home

1221
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
But for now

1222
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
We need

1223
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,575
Yeah and then will f*** you up

1224
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Yeah

1225
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,415
I mean there is no loyalty there's no consist

1226
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,207
It's never

1227
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:41,535
More clearly and body then when they start talking about

1228
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,071
Attorney General William Barr

1229
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:51,007
Someone who was not to be trusted at the beginning because he was associated with the book

1230
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:55,359
And then

1231
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,711
Started to get real creepy and super like accommodating of some of Trumps

1232
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
Biatch

1233
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,063
Cuz he's a hero and then he I became a hero he's out he's one of the good guys

1234
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,879
And then you got a pack of the little bits

1235
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
Some stuff that Alex didn't like I always knew he was a monster

1236
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
Yeah and then he said so

1237
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,303
Really really f***** up stuff

1238
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,375
And so now he's a villain

1239
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
What's a reserve Army

1240
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
Total desperation that was there

1241
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
Emergency

1242
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,551
That's exactly right

1243
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,719
Barr's father hired Jeffrey Epstein

1244
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,631
Significant

1245
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
Pipes I love him

1246
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
It's morning radio

1247
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Noxious

1248
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,247
Terrible

1249
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Cuz that is something that you

1250
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,831
You literally said that to me last week like

1251
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:15,231
I wonder how long it's going to take for him to take from to remember the Epstein stuff

1252
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,863
Headlines Barber said there wasn't evidence of widespread voter fraud

1253
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,727
I texted you well looks like Alex Becker remember that bars of Feeling Again

1254
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
Yep so sad predict

1255
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Polish it

1256
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
So it is makes clip Tom

1257
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,407
Has broken the case

1258
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
On what's going on

1259
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
Voting

1260
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
Pinky Thomas broken

1261
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,319
I think he does

1262
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
Know-how voting

1263
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
I agree

1264
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
And I have a potential idea of how this may have happened after examining

1265
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,327
Yesterday

1266
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
Using homeless shelters

1267
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,935
Downtown Atlanta

1268
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:00,287
Stronghold fusions

1269
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
Nursing home

1270
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,639
Uber allowed to vote

1271
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
Wait in

1272
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,391
2000 people you can't just walk into a homeless shelter and say I'm here

1273
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,463
Ridiculous

1274
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,535
General legal things that you can do

1275
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,839
Does he think of it people experiencing homelessness

1276
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:28,959
They don't get to vote cuz they don't have a permanent address

1277
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:35,359
They don't own property only property holding white men are allowed to vote Dan didn't you know that you think that people in residential care

1278
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,455
Vote like Alexander home

1279
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
You know those people have a right to vote since when

1280
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
Always

1281
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Oh

1282
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Be quiet

1283
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
I mean obviously

1284
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
I think it's a little transparent

1285
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:57,375
It's a little bit like remarkable the lack of grass put on any kind of Civic

1286
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
I'd like to

1287
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,543
Obviously

1288
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
Those people vote

1289
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
The girls

1290
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
That is exactly how they think

1291
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
Yep Tom believes

1292
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,271
Alex has a big big piece of news

1293
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
About

1294
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Social media

1295
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,111
I was getting back on

1296
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
No

1297
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
There's another one

1298
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Story

1299
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
But I haven't.

1300
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
I really really need to get to it

1301
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Deals with

1302
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
Level

1303
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
Now here

1304
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Censorship

1305
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
And it deals with YouTube

1306
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Preston videos

1307
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
White males

1308
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
Let them trim

1309
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Wow indeed I would imagine if they came out and said that there would be a large outcry

1310
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:57,791
So since he's saying that they did say that and I haven't heard about it I suppose they're suppressing the news upstairs depression

1311
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
Cuz dead serious

1312
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Someone has white

1313
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Scan and Ismail

1314
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
That the position just because you're white

1315
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
Quote Martin Luther King

1316
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Do it

1317
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
Ifucking dare you

1318
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,831
She says we will suppress white male

1319
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
What is that

1320
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
Racial division

1321
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:32,607
I found the article about this on Infowars and it's just about YouTube responding to their creators who have noted that there seems to be a

1322
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,935
Tobias and the algorithmic boosting the videos and channels are white

1323
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Creators

1324
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
In response

1325
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,823
They ask creators to voluntarily provide information about their identity

1326
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,359
Which could be used to help better

1327
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,711
Crack and see if there is an actual underlying bias and they're algorithm that they

1328
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
You can find a way to mitigate

1329
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,319
It stands now there's really no way for them to test that

1330
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
Because they have no data on the identities of the

1331
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:59,231
The Creator's so this would be a way that they could try to solve that problem that their users have request

1332
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Did they look into

1333
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
Alex is making up all the

1334
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,375
Details of the story including that quote about not letting white males Tran

1335
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
Who's all just him trying to scare his audience

1336
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
Spared super into white identity fear

1337
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Hey YouTube

1338
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,543
Walter white dudes

1339
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,311
Look into it

1340
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
So

1341
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
I just find this

1342
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
Tubi

1343
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
It's not

1344
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
White man

1345
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:29,183
Really going hard now but they're so desperate with their b******* it's

1346
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,463
Real pathetic

1347
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:36,351
The problem that I have is that like this is so easy to understand what the actual story is that on YouTube

1348
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Side

1349
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
Do things and like Alex

1350
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,727
Seems like you should have bigger issues right now like

1351
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
There's this whole election

1352
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,335
Frog thing there's the vaccines in the covid and all this

1353
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,663
Do you really need to try and Stoke White

1354
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,223
Beer out of the end and the answer is yes

1355
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,527
Yeah because that's his bread and butter

1356
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
That's something that's so important

1357
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
2

1358
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
Keeping the audience

1359
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
Cengage

1360
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,695
Interested

1361
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,487
It is it is interesting that you

1362
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Hammer one-story

1363
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
Like you know you can hit

1364
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:15,519
But with white identity stuff you've always got to provide more and more new examples each time otherwise people look like

1365
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,847
Wow that's the only reason they're that's the only thing they're pressing

1366
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,871
White man about

1367
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
You have to make up some

1368
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
New boats

1369
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
All the time

1370
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,503
And just misrepresent all sorts

1371
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
So Alex doesn't want to kill

1372
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,111
People although you said that he's killed people a bunch of

1373
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Yeah

1374
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
I don't want

1375
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Just start going around killing p

1376
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Everybody something

1377
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,655
We have a duty to not put up

1378
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Dash

1379
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
Say what

1380
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,495
You may think

1381
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
American problem

1382
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Wait what

1383
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
He's talking about the vaccine because he thinks

1384
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,687
The depopulation

1385
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:59,295
So you're the one who go around and kill people but like they're going to

1386
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Maxine

1387
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
How much like Joe Rogan

1388
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,159
Explaining bedtime to his child

1389
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
To go to

1390
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,487
Globalist and say Hey look

1391
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,535
I know you think there are too many

1392
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
How about don't kill them

1393
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
I guess

1394
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:20,031
In this example Alex is going to kill his kid if he doesn't go to bed

1395
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:26,431
Walk around killing children who don't do what he says yeah I'll become a legend of folklore the guy who kills you if you don't go to

1396
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:32,575
You'll be used to terrify children for Generations

1397
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
So Alex

1398
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Is Guyana

1399
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,487
You know there's some talk from these Addie's ex-president

1400
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,559
Sure about how they're going to take that vaccine on TV which I think

1401
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
It's stupid I think it's

1402
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,423
Perfunctory to do

1403
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
Of course has a bottle all ready to go

1404
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,383
You believe

1405
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
They're going to take

1406
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,367
But they're not just going to sterilize

1407
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,047
Obviously it's going to be if they do get it that'll be that's not really the vaccines is a cat

1408
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
Placebo

1409
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,655
Maxine

1410
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
Are we doing it's not the real

1411
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:26,591
Part of me even believes you get some sort of super-rich guy vaccine

1412
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
You guys

1413
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
I think

1414
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
That

1415
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,735
Not doing that

1416
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Is

1417
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,599
Wrong because there is something about the

1418
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
The communal

1419
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,415
Experiencing like

1420
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Seeing these people

1421
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Partake in something

1422
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,863
Very basically all it is it is it is there something unifying to

1423
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
High-profile people

1424
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,239
Being like I'm getting a shot toots

1425
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
The same way that like if you were

1426
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:00,639
Did your parent might get a shot totally fine

1427
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
We're heading over the Iraq

1428
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
I think there's something healthy when our leader is

1429
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Do that

1430
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:11,903
It so I'm not a I'm not opposed to it but pretending that it has any impact on

1431
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
People who are

1432
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
Say I don't think Road

1433
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,047
The people who hate this

1434
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,839
Three of you the most

1435
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,935
Going to be like well if they're getting the vaccine that I totally believe it

1436
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
Yeah Jesus

1437
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,335
So Alex went to a protest

1438
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
For this evening of the

1439
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
The third against

1440
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,199
Governor Abbott or something

1441
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
Maybe the mayor

1442
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
The mayor

1443
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,367
But Alex admits to assaulting someone

1444
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Last night

1445
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
Blur

1446
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
Private jet

1447
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
I was yelling at me

1448
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
Topsface a little

1449
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Emotional

1450
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
I probably shouldn't have assaulted him but he was taunting

1451
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,319
And I probably shouldn't have threatened his life

1452
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Hi removing

1453
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:19,231
You're the person who Alex pulled on his mask feel free to sue him

1454
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:24,351
He has admitted on-air that he assaulted you

1455
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,935
You could face open-and-shut case

1456
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
Snakes clip Alex

1457
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
Confesses to something else

1458
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
And that is that he is very stupid

1459
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
The big old islamophobe

1460
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
Police patrolling Pub

1461
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Scott

1462
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Eggs

1463
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
Flavoring whiskey

1464
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,231
Resting area

1465
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
Run sex reindeer kids

1466
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Weather

1467
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
So

1468
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,399
Escalated

1469
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
From

1470
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,495
Local cuisine

1471
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
They're not whiskey eggs

1472
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:10,175
Now he clearly doesn't it's an egg wrap

1473
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:13,759
Chicken sausage and then covered in breadcrumbs

1474
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
Like I immediately went that's not

1475
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
Scotch egg

1476
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
Did I not know there was with enough what's going on here is that in an area of the UK where this

1477
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
Restaurant in question was located

1478
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,167
The government has put in place rules that bars can't serve alcohol unless

1479
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,447
It's part of them operating

1480
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
As a restaurant

1481
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
Go to bed

1482
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,335
That is to say that bars and pubs without food or not allowed to be open

1483
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:43,199
There was a screenshot of a receipt from a London restaurant called The Refinery New Street

1484
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,015
Sciotoville 463 Peyronie's

1485
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:49,087
12 glasses of Prosecco in one scotch egg

1486
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,183
This was being circulated to imply that this is how they're going to get around the covid-19

1487
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
In reality the receipt is crop

1488
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,047
To make it appear that the group only ordered one

1489
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,375
It also ordered a ton more food according to the restaurant

1490
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,191
This is just a social media meme it's such b*******

1491
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:10,591
None of the stuff that Alex is reporting on here is real he's just misunderstanding a headline of a story that he hasn't read

1492
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,151
Making up what he thinks Scotch eggs are

1493
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,687
And using it to throw around 2

1494
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,735
Completely unnecessary islamophobia

1495
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,039
This is what he does as a career

1496
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,623
He's an idiot who refuses to do any preparation for any work

1497
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,671
I just spread hate all over the place

1498
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
Cuz he said it's all you can do

1499
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Useless

1500
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Social media's

1501
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,815
Devil we should

1502
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,399
Just get rid of it we should only live in communities of 150 or less

1503
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,447
Everybody owns their own business

1504
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:42,847
I've remade the entire global economy I saw this picture of the receipt and I thought like God

1505
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,407
That's fun it's very obviously like crap

1506
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
Total or anything the receipt is cut off right under the

1507
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,599
That's fun

1508
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,927
Cuz I got a lot of booze

1509
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,511
Yeah I don't I don't know I would say I was

1510
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
You try a little harder

1511
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,095
The internet

1512
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Cheaper

1513
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
Send a text with Alex

1514
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,983
Claims that he's known what's going to happen

1515
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,799
All this stuff that's happening around us

1516
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
He's known at all to attend years like

1517
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,663
Totally consistent on all of this

1518
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,063
Martial law forced inoculation

1519
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
How did Joan snowing

1520
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
They said they do it

1521
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,231
Operation lockstep

1522
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
Didn't exist 10 years ago

1523
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,471
Romeo and Juliet commit suicide

1524
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Kill you

1525
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:51,455
Operation lockstep isn't a real thing Alex didn't know about it all

1526
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,759
Nothing is such horseshit

1527
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Like

1528
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,575
Right before the twin

1529
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:03,231
16 election Alex wasn't making his audience scared but I'd like a virus that was going to bring in martial law and track

1530
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
King in all this

1531
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,303
Obama was going to declare himself

1532
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,351
The king of a Muslim Nation

1533
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:12,191
It was that it was that it was none of this

1534
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,799
Stevi B's said he was waiting for the government collapsed so it could make everybody Dukes

1535
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,175
Do do do do

1536
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
Play this car

1537
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,223
You don't get to pretend that

1538
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,623
It's interesting from the rubble of a nuclear explosion in Chicago

1539
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,159
According to Alex's prediction

1540
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
That's kind of what I was

1541
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,743
Yeah if he's been right about everything

1542
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,351
This is the shell game that you get to play when you're someone like Alex and your audience

1543
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:45,983
Just decided to give up much like you you don't have to click do you want to play

1544
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:52,383
To give up and believe you're. Browbeaten to the point of life

1545
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:58,527
Oh yeah he has always been saying that they'd use a virus to bring in world government

1546
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,367
No he hasn't if I believe they should the s*** he saying about

1547
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:05,183
Now why wouldn't I believe him when he says

1548
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
Now

1549
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,743
That he said it earlier

1550
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Right

1551
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,119
This actually gets to one of the reasons why I'm even

1552
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,655
If I were Joe Rogan

1553
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:19,007
I would just be personally offended by the way Alex is treated me

1554
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
Just as a matter of like sulfur

1555
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Respect I wouldn't

1556
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Hang out with him

1557
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:27,455
If you want to take a step farther into scuss like what the real issues are

1558
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,527
When Alex was on Rogan

1559
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Podcast last

1560
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Was Tim Dillon

1561
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
When they had that episode

1562
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
And Alex was

1563
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,439
One step away from being a

1564
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,231
Exposed as having made up

1565
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,839
Operation lockstep they drop the ball there

1566
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,423
And again like I said not their fault they didn't know whatever was

1567
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
But

1568
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
Because they didn't

1569
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,543
That means Alex winds that point

1570
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,079
Because of that because

1571
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,431
Alex didn't get exposed in front of millions of people as having made up

1572
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:03,039
This Rockefeller planned that now he's claiming he's known about for 10 years

1573
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
He gets to play games like this

1574
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
And you have done

1575
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
At least

1576
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,183
By virtue of

1577
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,743
Your inability to stand up to the claim

1578
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
You

1579
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Help solidify

1580
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
You've helped

1581
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,351
Reinforce and make it look like

1582
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
And

1583
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
Defect

1584
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,191
Like here's what I'm more offended by

1585
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
What's up

1586
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,519
Rogan had every opportunity

1587
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
After

1588
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
That podcast

1589
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,591
Define shop

1590
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,919
If Alex was full of s*** and blind to him

1591
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
And clearly

1592
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,455
He didn't

1593
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
Because you did

1594
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,343
Yeah it would it would suggest he didn't really follow up on

1595
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
But such a big

1596
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,999
Obvious one Deluxe that thing is

1597
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,815
So f****** obvious if you know what he's talking about

1598
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
It's just disgraceful and

1599
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399
Like like I said

1600
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
Personal level

1601
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,215
Alex is treated

1602
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
Rogan as a as a person is

1603
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,287
Is disgraceful and no one

1604
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
You should put up with that

1605
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,335
But

1606
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,383
Societally does it does damage

1607
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Not being

1608
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Competent

1609
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,271
At pushing back against Alex's narrative

1610
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,599
Only serves to sell your audience

1611
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,671
It does seem like with propaganda in

1612
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
Those kind of Outlaw

1613
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
There is

1614
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,255
One chance to win

1615
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
Or you lose

1616
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
Like once you see ground on that

1617
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
It's gone

1618
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
It never comes back

1619
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
And if you win

1620
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
You don't gain the ground

1621
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,751
You just don't lose it

1622
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
And it's brutal

1623
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
Yeah if you put

1624
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,359
Yourself in that situation you got under

1625
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,175
Understand that as the suffix

1626
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,503
Hi especially if you got millions of listeners ever

1627
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,087
It's why if you're somebody who has a platform

1628
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,879
And you bring somebody on who's

1629
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
Maybe a bad actor

1630
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,207
You have really high

1631
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Levels of responsibility

1632
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:51,839
Target if you're somebody who has a show you can bring on someone like Richard

1633
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,423
Spencer Milo yiannopoulos have a great responsibility

1634
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,215
To not allow them

1635
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
To frame everything

1636
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
Matt is

1637
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Your job

1638
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,847
And in the challenge is such that you can

1639
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Cannot

1640
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,687
Half acid

1641
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,527
Unfortunate naivete or whatever I don't believe that

1642
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
Any more place

1643
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
But like

1644
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,623
He's just having a conversation with friend

1645
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
Or whatever least that's what he wants to

1646
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
Present

1647
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
Because of that

1648
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,767
You do never going to be in a position

1649
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,351
And that's why he can't have people at opolis on anymore

1650
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
You can't have those Gaston anymore because

1651
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
It's to you

1652
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,727
Can't do that can't do it

1653
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
It somehow Alex is still fine

1654
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,567
But I don't know how

1655
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
I don't even know what we're doing

1656
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:39,711
So anyway we have one last clip here and Alex has a Gaston named Jennifer flag

1657
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,015
And she claimed that she had footage

1658
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
Major something of

1659
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,575
Voter fraud in Austin

1660
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
Sharaya because of course

1661
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,255
Deep blue areas are only deep blue because the Democrats are stealing all the vote whatever

1662
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,047
That's right so she's on

1663
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,863
And I found this really weird because she was like she was running

1664
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,679
For some office at NAS lost in the GOP Primary

1665
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,751
Then became a poll Watcher sure that's good

1666
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:07,871
Got into some kind of a dust-up cuz she had like recording equipment and you're not allowed to have that

1667
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
Macy Gray

1668
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,991
Okay I don't care really don't care about any of it

1669
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
Like her voter fraud stories

1670
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,391
Cuz they're saying that I don't see any evidence of this so many people in politics

1671
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
Text you wouldn't be allowed in a

1672
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,231
Bars have

1673
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:29,887
She wouldn't go to a bar because she's very into God and going to church and all that they read that on her ballot

1674
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,423
DDR qna

1675
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Anyway

1676
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,727
I don't care about

1677
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,799
Their interview at all but I would just like to Denver

1678
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,407
Straight what sort of people the two of them are as they get into some real ableist

1679
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,431
Shitheadra Joker

1680
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,759
Remember reading the governor's

1681
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,295
Negative order the summer

1682
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
And neither were like

1683
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,391
Directions to businesses closing

1684
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,719
Are are the exceptions and I remember one of them was that

1685
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
He closed all the raft

1686
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
Businesses

1687
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,375
Like you couldn't like to ear rafting businesses couldn't stay open

1688
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
And I thought

1689
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,447
How bizarre that he would attack

1690
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,239
A small business in Pak

1691
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:11,103
Taxes and let all these other

1692
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,639
I'm sorry the handicapped

1693
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
Can't go rushing

1694
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,015
No it's because float trip

1695
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
We're spreading

1696
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
A lot of

1697
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:25,439
Cases of covid-19 that float trips

1698
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,487
Blue trip to spread over

1699
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,559
Float trips in in raft

1700
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
Some stuff like that are just like

1701
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
20 year olds

1702
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
Drunk as f***

1703
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
In big groups

1704
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,727
Barges going down the river like it

1705
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Obviously yeah

1706
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,591
It seems if you've never been on a float

1707
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,127
Triple for probably might be like

1708
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Advocate

1709
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,647
I can see a someone who's been on a lot of float trips

1710
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
I can see why

1711
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Why someone would cause a rash

1712
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
That's f****** shity

1713
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
The way they're acting and being like yeah he's

1714
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
He's going to

1715
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,143
You just mad that he can't go rafting

1716
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
F*** you Alex

1717
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
You love Greg Abbott until he didn't do what you wanted him to do now

1718
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,384
Situation here no

1719
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
Attack him

1720
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,944
For his disability

1721
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,992
Status go f*** yourself yep

1722
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
What up what up

1723
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
Piece of s***

1724
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,112
Anytime you are talking about somebody and then you use

1725
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
And then a descriptor that is not

1726
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,976
Then you

1727
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,328
It's like it's like that whenever you know when you're listening to

1728
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
That that

1729
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Andy Daly and Paul at Southgate

1730
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
Kansas where he was as l.ron Hubbard

1731
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
Every time you heard him say like

1732
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,008
A Japanese you're like

1733
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
Yeah

1734
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Netsertive linguistic

1735
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,480
Framing is pissed is terrible

1736
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,808
And I want to say

1737
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,600
Everybody who Alex

1738
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,624
Likes now

1739
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:05,792
Look at how he's treating people who have behaved in ways that are just slightly outside of what he wants them

1740
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Them to do

1741
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Look at this

1742
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
He loved Greg Abbott

1743
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,912
One of the best still Governor's Inn

1744
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,472
Country probably

1745
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,520
Real great Governor we love him

1746
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Now he's

1747
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
Being able

1748
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:23,712
Best against mezz attacking him only for like him not being extreme enough but on these really shity

1749
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,016
Personal grounds that are bigoted and horrible

1750
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
Rogan

1751
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:33,696
When he's doing what he wants him to do Alex be like he's so brave he's braver than Tucker Carlson correct when he doesn't

1752
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
He'll bring up

1753
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,256
Your kids and things going to distract you

1754
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
Cut you in half

1755
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,560
Bleed you like a

1756
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
Consider this

1757
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
This is how Alex operates

1758
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Yeah

1759
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
I mean

1760
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
6

1761
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,544
So the thing is he dissing this form of unreality that has to be total

1762
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,920
You can't allow a single real thing to come into the unreality Bubba

1763
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,944
Yeah otherwise

1764
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
The whole thing birth

1765
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,784
So just like if you're senior got you know

1766
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,344
Bar is doing something different while now

1767
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
I can't allow that into the Bubba

1768
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
You know

1769
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Well it's

1770
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
It's the new one

1771
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
But you introduced

1772
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,280
When you're like taco bar if you

1773
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,072
He's kind of s*** head I wanted

1774
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,864
Why would he not

1775
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,656
Do this thing that I think

1776
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
He should

1777
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,216
You can't you can't relate

1778
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,800
Well I'm the end not just that but you painted the Democrats as

1779
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Totelcom

1780
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Pleat Eva

1781
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,152
So any agreement with the Democrats

1782
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,944
Means you're evil

1783
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,480
You have to be

1784
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,552
Otherwise that introduces the possibility that

1785
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,344
Not all Democrats are

1786
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
Everything falls apart

1787
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
It's done

1788
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:41,280
I will say that Alex also played a lot of the trumps

1789
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,048
Speech

1790
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Joyce 49-minute video

1791
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
Yahoo

1792
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
Shorebreak

1793
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:52,288
I know I don't have a lot of clips of it because Alex didn't editorialize on it all that much

1794
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:55,872
Exactly like

1795
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:00,992
And I want to make a point of this like as we close the episode that like that was on his show

1796
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
And it's scary as hell but

1797
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
Because trumpet sounds like

1798
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
It's f****** terrifying

1799
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
.

1800
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
I don't know what else to say about it

1801
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
I hope

1802
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,536
You know it's it's so weird to talk

1803
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
To my family now because

1804
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
It's like

1805
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
Before

1806
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,544
In the old times you know they could be like we're just mainstream Republicans we do talk about that Alex Jones stuff and it's like

1807
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,312
Like now

1808
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
You voted for Trump

1809
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,664
This is what he saying you're in my world and you're wrong

1810
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
That's it

1811
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,504
So if you want to and you can't argue with me

1812
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
That's over

1813
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:35,808
Viet

1814
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
You believe

1815
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
Vicious

1816
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Yeah

1817
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
Really bummed me out

1818
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
I guess

1819
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,768
Agus bum me out but it felt really weird is like

1820
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
I always

1821
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,584
Because I listen to so much Alex

1822
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
When when people would say like Trump sounds like Alex Jones some slight differences

1823
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,592
That's not really what Alex is talking point

1824
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
You thinking

1825
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,944
Yeah now it do you listen to the tapes

1826
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Stuff that I was like

1827
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,272
Holyshit

1828
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,344
Exactly the same as I might as well like Playa

1829
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
That 92nd

1830
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,672
Can clip and be like her name is this

1831
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
It's

1832
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,024
I wouldn't be surprised if he starts doing that soon

1833
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
It's

1834
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
Crazy

1835
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
Thank you Jeff

1836
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,728
You take the support you got and when

1837
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,520
It's looking real bad like it is

1838
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
Yeah

1839
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
What you got is

1840
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
Alex and Tom pepper

1841
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Good luck I just keep

1842
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
But I'd like the thing that I

1843
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
Keep thinking is just like

1844
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Be wary

1845
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Be wary

1846
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,552
Because when these lawsuits and stuff

1847
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
He's deaf

1848
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,880
That's pretty now that when the lawsuits and stuff stop

1849
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,208
Does anybody really believe he's going to be like well

1850
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
Guess I lost

1851
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,352
You know when the lawsuits are done yeah he's got to do some

1852
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,376
I think he

1853
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,912
Motorsport

1854
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Do you think he might

1855
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
Just give up

1856
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,568
Well who you made a bunch of money that's true

1857
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,360
But he's never met he doesn't make

1858
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
None of these guys ever make

1859
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:10,016
I don't know another thirty billion dollars is everybody dies around

1860
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,344
He doesn't need it right I don't know I don't know in like

1861
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,672
Wargaming what we imagine he's going to

1862
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:22,048
To-do list

1863
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
I found it

1864
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
This is useless

1865
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
Use of my time

1866
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,680
He's always

1867
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:33,824
Why's I think being worried I've a lot of people are just thinking it's going to go away and I'm just saying be weary head on a swivel

1868
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,408
Look around

1869
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
Keep an eye out

1870
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:43,552
This is not the 70-79 days of hell but it is the 79 days of

1871
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,624
Where are you

1872
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Easy

1873
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:55,072
Careful careful

1874
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,632
So we'll see what happens

1875
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,216
And maybe maybe we'll do that Rogan episode

1876
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,520
Sooner than later

1877
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,312
It is a 4-Hour

1878
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:11,712
Like mystery box today I did only make it through the first bit if it could be amazing

1879
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,016
I want it gets rolling or it could be

1880
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Be

1881
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
Continuing of that

1882
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:21,440
Walking through f****** knee-deep mud it has to be a disaster

1883
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
Something

1884
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,744
To like think your teeth

1885
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
Send to because

1886
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
That just

1887
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,352
Is you

1888
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:31,424

1889
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192

1890
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
It's good

1891
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
Great guy

1892
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
Come on now

1893
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,360
So we will be back but until then

1894
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
We do have a website

1895
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:52,160
A local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out

1896
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:59,328
Until then I'm Mio and Leo and bcx Barkan Daryl rundus I didn't bring this up earlier but I

1897
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,608
I think it's really funny

1898
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:07,008
That at the time that we started recording this episode I don't know if Rudy Giuliani actually has covid-19

1899
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,288
The headline is just

1900
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,824
The Trump said

1901
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,200
Sohu

1902
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Anyway that's

1903
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Pretty pretty

1904
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,040
I don't know it's not a good place to

1905
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
To be as a society

1906
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:28,000
