23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
Couch looks great also it didn't come with two of the cushion so it's now

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,135

65
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
So Jordan out of time for the entire episode

74
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,543

00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759

00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
I don't respond

152
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183

But recognize that a lot of things

195
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Is

196
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Very strongly pushing

197
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
Into the mainstream consciousness

198
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
I am so that's pretty sad one of my least favorite

199
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
The things that make me so infuriating as it is when people

200
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
Diagnose the correct problem

201
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,135
That we all know how it happened

202
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Everyone knows

203
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
Like I like

204
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
Alright his creator

205
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
And because it's easier to do that but everybody knows

206
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
And take it outside

207
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,783
And larger one world government a vaccination communities

208
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Have demonized a long time in the right-wing is picking up on that and amplifying

209
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
They might not have

210
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
Recognizing

211
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
Charlie conspiracy

212
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Here's the last clip

213
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
From Rogan

214
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
This one really I love because

215
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
Rogan

216
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
How I like a

217
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
In Alicante

218
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
It's no good but there's like a profit motive in vaccines right bye-bye

219
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,231
GoPro

220
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
So what is actually supporting is like public subsidization

221
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
Yes nice yes

222
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Write to a brick wall

223
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
There is profit

224
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
What's the problem

225
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
When someone looks

226
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Conspiracy

227
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Say something like

228
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
You can't say

229
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
How much

230
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Is a

231
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
I wish there was none

232
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
I wish

233
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Making them just

234
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Ferraris

235
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Everything where people do it

236
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Seems to require

237
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
You know it's funny

238
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Maybe

239
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Be

240
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Angry

241
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Make money

242
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
They're also

243
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Angry because

244
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Where Senegal

245
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
And we won

246
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Okay they're making

247
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Money

248
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Would it be possible

249
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Basketball

250
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
People more

251
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Or is he

252
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Got more

253
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
More money

254
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Problem

255
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Human Nature

256
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Boreal

257
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Give me the reality

258
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Not vaccinating

259
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
And having way more people to

260
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Is Roy Moore profit

261
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
That's a good point is it

262
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
Be alright

263
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Oh yeah

264
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Haha

265
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Episode breakdown about

266
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Really pretty

267
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Alex completely lied

268
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
About that

269
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
Hey Alex insane crazy s*** about our conversation

270
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
Like that's embarrassing that's really bad

271
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
I can't I can't find a way

272
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,311
His reaction to that to make sense to me because he's a good old man

273
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,943
That constitutes a massive betrayal

274
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,807
Twisted it changed it and ruined it and turned it into a propaganda

275
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
Without my knowledge

276
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:37,279
Try to piggyback a story and make it about himself

277
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,655
Borderline sociopath

278
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
Well I don't know right to make up their boundaries as they see the broken doesn't season

279
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Complete breach of trust than that works right

280
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
It seems like

281
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
You got to expect you at work

282
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
Not expect after saying like how did Bill Gates become the bad guy you build toilets

283
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
We're going to get to the 22nd

284
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
But there's another thing that I came across that I felt needed to be talked about

285
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Of the War Room

286
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Not a full episode but a clip

287
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Owen Shroyer put out

288
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
I just want to put this down on wax as it were putting stuff like

289
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Out into the world

290
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Wow

291
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
So that's probably bad take I will

292
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
I didn't do this and you shouldn't do it

293
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
Still negative consequences format

294
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,199
People like to get sick

295
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Like yes

296
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Lakewood View

297
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,367
Like I understand they're still even like some Randomness with the doorknob

298
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,463
Like would you you know you could do that a possibility

299
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Picture Exchange

300
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Bodily fluids

301
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
With someone who has tested positive is definitely contagious

302
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Express

303
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
Real lame

304
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Right to reopen stuff and what have you

305
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
Hear about how would it really is

306
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,111
Is a rally to spread the virus

307
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Because

308
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,719
Then what they can do is they can say that we're trying to spread the virus

309
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
No one gets it

310
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
It'll all blow up in the media space

311
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,863
This is really bad really stupid

312
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
I'm exhausted

313
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Fake fake fake fake fake fake

314
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,032
I remember brevity being the soul of wit and I guess I was wrong

315
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,384
Yeah yeah

316
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
But I think things like really bad

317
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
If you're wrong

318
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
I think that if people die

319
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
These rallies or

320
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,744
Or gory things it kind of makes it look like you're

321
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Encouraging

322
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
That might have been a part of leading to their

323
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
Being infected and getting sick and dying so

324
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,544
First of all even if that was like

325
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
You know

326
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
A joke

327
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
It's not a good joke

328
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
No I can I can separate myself and be like

329
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,696
No

330
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,792
I mean they might as well

331
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
At this point

332
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
String somebody up in brno holes Farm

333
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
The person inside of you guys are sacrificing yourselves

334
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Or something I don't know why

335
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
It's it's weird because

336
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,152
It doesn't feel exactly like that because of the like randomness

337
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
You're not Randomness but you know you could go to all of the rallies and not get sick

338
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
It is possible

339
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
You can tell yourself that there isn't a risk

340
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,304
I don't know I don't know

341
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:03,680
Each time when the bombs fell there was a guy who lived through two nuclear bombs

342
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
I didn't know that

343
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
You can

344
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
You can do all kinds of s*** but I'm not going to know I understand

345
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Taking risks

346
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
So we get to the 22nd

347
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:30,048
Rogan's rebuttal and Owen City jokes

348
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
Tom and Jerry about that except

349
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Remember that

350
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,336
Yeah so we can do the 22nd and here we jump

351
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
And that is

352
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Pastors

353
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
America are fighting back

354
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Great

355
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
The closure

356
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
We have

357
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
The beginning of the

358
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Pastors

359
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136

Ninja Turtle martial law lockdown

You under the First Amendment have no law have no right

363
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Tutuapp

Tablespoon of religion

Exercise

368
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
The first word

369
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
What's a government form

370
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
By the people was established

371
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
What

372
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Congress

00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Telmate

No law

375

You realize that was

376
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Adidon

377
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
Congress

379
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728

385
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
Congress Moses didn't really make the laws

00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
She'll make no law

387
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Fake fake fake

388
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Bushman

389
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Sarah

390
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
I wonder if it any point in that constant repetition of saying Congress shall not

391
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
Nothing to do with any of this at all borders or business closures Congress

392
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
I shall make no law

393
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
The only person who's walking into dicey constitutional territory right now is Trump when he threatens to override the

394
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
State Governors don't go wrong with what he wants

395
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,608
Imperia violation of the Tenth Amendment

396
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,568
Do bunch of nonsense illegally can't make the governor's open up everything it's all just posturing and

397
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Yelling to his basin

398
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,992
Crooked dangerous embarrassment

399
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
He's Mister states rights and he's supposed to be a constitutional scholar

400
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Don't make sense

401
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,768
If the Constitution says the Congress shall not make a law about religion or prohibiting the free exercise

402
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,120
Bring up when Congress isn't making

403
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:21,568
General you know like when it says Congress is kind of more just saying like everybody shall make no

404
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,712
Any group of people is really a congress

405
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,832
Do you notice something that last clip that was a little bit weird

406
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
About Alex's phrasing

407
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,768
I caught that the first time around 2 I got real worried

408
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,144
Words of the government established

409
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
The Rebellion

410
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
We the People

411
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
What about the articles

412
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
The confederation

413
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Government the first word

414
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,576
Cannot make any laws or have no regulations

415
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Bill of Rights

416
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Embarrassing

417
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,328
What is bad the Declaration of Independence begins We the People

418
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
And that is not true

419
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,936
Anywhere the Declaration of Independence

420
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,336
What Alex quote

421
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
And to assume among the powers of the Earth been separated

422
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation

423
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:47,840
The beginning of the Declaration of Independence

424
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
King Richard shall make no law restricting

425
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,520
The people is the preamble to the Constitution

426
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
The difference between constitutional Declaration of Independence

427
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
American Patriot

428
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Who started all this stuff

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,392
Constitution

430
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:17,280
Soon as we got ourselves a country going we're all like alright let's start with a

431
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,680
I got to do something

432
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Union

433
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Guides

434
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
The country

435
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
It starts with Article 1

436
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Which lays out the structure of the legislative branch

437
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,920
The news article 24 the executive

438
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:39,296
There's seven articles and total the original document for the Amendments ever added

439
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,904
Alex doesn't know that much about the Constitution or American history

440
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Scary whenever

441
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
Disagrees with you he's not really interested

442
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
You just wants to fight

443
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,632
And the Amendments of the enumeration of things that the government can't do

444
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
And would give him Justice

445
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
Application to the government

446
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
Anyone with the familiarity with US Government like I don't know what say you took a class in high school on it

447
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,552
No idea

448
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
Is a whole thing as a charade

449
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
Everything is b*******

450
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
People most likely

451
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Karaokanta

452
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,120
Pull it out and put it up in Hugo

453
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,192
I don't remember that being there at all

454
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
So Alex

455
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:34,336
The beginning of this episode is about

456
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,944
Churches to be on essential

457
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Is mad about that cuz

458
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
He thinks that they want to end religion

459
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
And make us all worship estate

460
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Why has

461
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Europe

462
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
The Europe

463
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,488
Do you ask

464
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
The longest

465
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Because it's the most essential

466
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
Sociology psychology and biology textbook

467
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
Religion is mental illness

468
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
Religion of the state

469
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,944
Humanism

470
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Process

471
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
I don't like it either

472
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
This is

473
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Prime movement

474
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Prime

475
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
The end

476
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
You're right either believe in God or not believe in God

477
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
So in terms of opening up

478
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,640
Church isn't a difference of opinion on the question

479
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Community

480
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
Reverend itself could not be the focus

481
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Pics of the question

482
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,160
Because the people themselves

483
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Are the church

484
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
People are essential important but not essential

485
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:02,400
As long as there's a virus spreading that's killing people it's more important to protecting them and then to go to a building

486
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
He cites other folks like Pastor David yule

487
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Who said

488
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,312
What are the essentials God would ask for the church

489
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
Ultra series called Essentials and guess what

490
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Wasn't

491
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
Church is a healthy Church

492
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
Who are their pastors Zack esswein new said quote

493
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,672
We don't prove our faith by defying orders the hand of another

494
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,232
We prove our faith by denying ourselves

495
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,792
So that we can clear the throat of a neighbor who can't breathe

496
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
I mean even though even their own f****** books as a anywhere men Gather in my name I am with ever whatever it is

497
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,104
Gather digital exactly

498
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
Christian Community believes it's at the suspension of in-person surfaces is appropriate

499
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,624
The guardian reported in early April about Sacramento

500
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,512
Search the didn't take warning seriously at least 71

501
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
Headlight March NBC News reported on an Arkansas

502
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,960
And the result was at least 30 catching Coronavirus

503
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
Including a pastor and his wife

504
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
The pastor made a statement

505
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,128
Maybe you assume that it couldn't happen to you just like I did

506
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
Please adhere to the social instructions that you receive in locally and nationally

507
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,808
Another was Bishop Gerald o Glenn from Richmond Virginia

508
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,928
He was defiant about continuing to hold Services quote unless I'm in jail or the hospital

509
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,256
He said quote I am essential I'm a preacher I talked

510
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
The god

511
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,216
His wife also tested positive and it's hard to imagine that there aren't some other churchgoers who have as well

512
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Granddaughter said it becomes very real to you

513
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,920
I just begged people to understand the severity

514
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
It's about everyone around us

515
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
They're more stories like this but I think you get the point and they're all about the same

516
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,440
We will not take the risk seriously then when the consequences come they say I should have listened please take this seriously

517
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:08,096
The goal is to hopefully never end up in a position where you have to tell people to not be like you and to take the situation

518
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Seriously

519
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,240
That's what these people whose lives are affected by the virus are trying to communicate to the rest of us

520
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
It would be wise to heed their words

521
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
I think everything that I've read

522
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Do even like even most

523
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
Recent polls

524
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,808
The overwhelming majority even among Christians even among Republicans even among everybody is

525
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Let's stay inside

526
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Get through this s***

527
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
But the symbols

528
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,256
From every possible journalistic Outlet

529
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
These

530
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
He was protesting

531
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Steel like

532
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,656
Holyshit the entire right-wing is

533
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,776
A small vocal minority that keeps dying every bit of press they possibly can

534
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,360
2

535
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
Consistent polling is showing people not wanting to rush

536
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah

537
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Witches mark

538
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:08,256
Which is why of course they elected people who are screaming at them that it's time to reopen

539
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:13,888
The reasons why churches will be a serious Vector for virus transmission is pretty clear about it for a second

540
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
There's an almost ritualize environment of shaking hands of hugging and eating

541
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,616
Universal a donation basket

542
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
Who sings could be a big problem

543
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,272
I understand and I empathize with the people for whom going to church of the Cornerstone of their lives

544
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
People with physical Church of the center of their social and emotional

545
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,792
I would never want to minimize that and I do want to respect it but at the same time

546
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,936
When they're such serious Stakes involved are other ways the spirituality

547
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
And religion of your choice

548
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Can still be practice

549
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,824
I really enjoy this quote from Reverend deals op-ed

550
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,432
Virus has not cancelled worship but it changed the way we worship

551
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:04,576
The New Normal or at least for the moment may put more emphasis on our personal relationship to our God

552
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
And how each one of us chooses to work

553
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
Maybe just maybe The New Normal will be a positive thing

554
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Batman

555
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Beautiful sentiment

556
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
Constanta through them and they don't have any effect on

557
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
What supposed to be the Cornerstone which is our own

558
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Connection with the divine

559
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,904
Christianity

560
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
To wear masks and not go to church for a little bit

561
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:46,816
Christianity is not a religion

562
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
It's never survived anything like this

563
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
Most of what Alex's is getting on about

564
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,896
Because he has an interview on the show

565
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,296
Who does went viral for tearing up a cease-and-desist order

566
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Play uncomfortable

567
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Possibly

568
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
I don't know enough about that preacher I don't care

569
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,336
Astorian

570
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
That's a bummer

571
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Non-essential

572
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Because

573
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Refused to close

574
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Two Shoes watching TV

575
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,048
I don't know but what he talked about in Europe necessarily but one in the USA

576
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,144
I'm not positive

577
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,032
Two shoes and watches TV but fortunately it is a real story

578
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
At least as they're currently available

579
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,920
The first Pentecostal Church in Holly Springs Mississippi

580
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,320
Divide local stay-at-home orders and set fire to it and left a message

581
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,952
Bet you stay home now you Hypocrites spelled hypokrites

582
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,840
Was that tough misspelling

583
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
There's some investigation needs to be done to nail down the culprit and all that but it looks like this

584
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
If that's what it turns out to be

585
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,968
Counterproductive to the aims of the potential

586
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
I like the arsonist motivated by

587
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,904
Churches going to stop over like renting out another space

588
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
It's an act

589
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Pointless wrong

590
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Probably counterproductive

591
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,376
It's interesting to think about this though and compared to the other instances of crimes like this and how Alex response to them

592
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,984
Whenever there's an incident of someone sprain swastikas on a Jewish person

593
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Any of that sort of hate crime

594
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
How to immediately and without proof that the whole thing is fake

595
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
Sub leftist spray-painted the swastika in order to make it look like there's a actual knob he's around

596
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Haven't caught the culprit

597
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
We just had some graffiti that indicates

598
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,328
The first because the church's Define stay-at-home order

599
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,960
Because this incident works for Alex's

600
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
How much does a question this at all

601
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,336
Consideration

602
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,736
You should be speculating about the possibility

603
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,856
Unless that message

604
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,208
The speculation and conspiracy doesn't apply in cases like this because they don't need to

605
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,280
Speculation and conspiracy for Alex or tools

606
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
Of right-wing gun and white supremacist apology

607
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,704
And to be clear I'm not saying

608
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
I don't think it is a mostly just pointing out how

609
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,504
Instances how to study Alex dance

610
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,136
Pay attention to the way he engages in similar stories that Target different groups

611
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:28,000
Pay attention to that

612
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,584
Immensely

613
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
The s*** out of me

614
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Why what

615
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Come on man.

616
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,616
I know this is just going to make more people false flags are a real thing

617
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,480
Hey Siri

618
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Investigation

619
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,768
Okay well I just I just don't use your mind

620
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
More just because

621
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Regardless of how it

622
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,216
The church and the church goers and all of us are in this together

623
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
They're not

624
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
They're not a problem

625
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
The problem is how they got to where they are

626
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
We need to focus on

627
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,760
The propaganda and who's doing all of this and who's pushing this way

628
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:28,160
Why are you why would you bother with it with that that's insane

629
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,744
It only serves to hurt

630
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
The possibility of of

631
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,864
Some sort of understanding and better pass forward

632
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,336
Here's here's why I think he's talking about it

633
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Situation

634
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Yep okay

635
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:57,856
He tells a story about going on a walk and seeing a white guy in a

636
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,416
Like a building under construction

637
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
What no

638
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
What is the difference between the two stories

639
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
He's using inoculate himself from a lot of the racism

640
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
How's the position

641
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
He's going to express

642
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
And I will say this

643
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
Upright story

644
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
I do believe it's true

645
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,344
But you he's founded Alex inside a new video

646
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
I would say that this is not good

647
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
It's not hard hitting

648
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Show coming up I've got

649
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
The footage

650
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
We just pulled up in the park

651
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
In the middle of the parkway

652
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,848
In the middle of a park over the curb

653
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Sabella Park

654
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Parking lot

655
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Billionaire Superstars

656
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
Messing with the police that's really asking for it

657
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Whatever

658
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Hit a patch of grass next to some train tracks

659
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
When the police say why they're talking to him

660
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Drug activity

661
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,623
This is just part of propaganda

662
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
It's really important for Alex to make excuses for inform conspiracies about any incidents that appear to be racially motivated by

663
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,071
Violent scary

664
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,399
Because his entire worldview centers around White victimhood

665
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
The actual killing looks pretty bad

666
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,503
That way pretending to be opposed to The Killing

667
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
But at the same time it'll really condemn it for what it appears to be

668
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,279
What are you doing

669
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
This is a group of a deficient that means he probably

670
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,031
Obviously

671
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
The only thing that's the game is being played here

672
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,175
And again this is almost the perfect case study analysis racism

673
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,295
What do you want to understand

674
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,111
Covers

675
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,439
We're two white men chase down an unarmed black man

676
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,839
And how we covered the case of Kate steinle

677
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,447
The gun rack in a rag

678
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
When white people are the victims is an anti-white hate crime

679
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
When white people are the perpetrator

680
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
The victim wasn't so great themselves they probably had it coming

681
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,735
This is how this works yet again it's about the differences

682
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,783
You compare things that are

683
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:12,671
You know hey Will your coverage goes this way one time

684
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:18,303
Why is that really only one explanation does not matter

685
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
The

686
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Circumstances

687
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
Surrounding

688
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Don't murder people

689
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
That seems very simple

690
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,031
I don't understand why you need to add other like on well

691
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
Hold on this person I don't know if you know this

692
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
So a pack of gum one time

693
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
Oh well nevermind

694
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Of course

695
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
He was in a house

696
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,903
Precedes and Alex doing is essentially trying to Bill

697
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
Build a shity case as to why you shouldn't care

698
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
That much

699
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
About about arberys death

700
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
With jogging pants

701
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
Calling with marijuana

702
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
They didn't arresting

703
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
Because they were politically correct

704
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
So then months later

705
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,927
He takes them out

706
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,255
People go to stopping who the f*** are you

707
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
Holyshit

708
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
Kind of sounds like you are

709
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,871
Neighborhood

710
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
With a hood over his head

711
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
Bootleggers robber outfit

712
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
You asked me how do I do song

713
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,207
Weather in Blackfoot Idaho

714
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
They got that dumb stupid

715
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,655
So the police in 2017 didn't catch arbery with marijuana

716
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
Allow them to search his car and suspect

717
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
Matter at all in terms of the bigger conversation that's being had here

718
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:15,039
I was literally says that weed to be decriminalized yet he's here using a lie about the police catching Arbor with weed painted picture

719
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Is not that big a deal

720
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
Also the argument let's citizen's arrest

721
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,535
Rules about the use of force in terms of putting someone under citizen's arrest

722
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:30,143
Anyone could make the argument that the Justified lethal Force

723
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,239
Outback in love for Alex make that argument especially in court

724
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
That would be fun

725
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:42,175
The whole story Alex's telling about seeing a white person in a hoodie on his morning hike or whatever it's absolutely a fakes

726
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:48,319
Story has just concocted to say horrible things about looks like a thug

727
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
Alex gives himself permission to make these very clearly racially coded attacks on a murder victim by fabricating person

728
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
But he's also applying these labels to

729
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,703
Person

730
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Really

731
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
You know there

732
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
I don't have anything to do

733
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
From where I'm sitting is

734
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
What do you know that that would be too explicit

735
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
He probably doesn't want to deal with the consequences of expressing his opinion

736
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
It's insane

737
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
I wouldn't

738
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
I would do this

739
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
No matter what like okay

740
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Let's do this

741
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,127
Do the opposite situation

742
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,735
There is a white dude dressed in Army fatigues carrying gun

743
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,039
Who has who is

744
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
Killed for looking like a terror

745
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:59,231
And then we find out he's got a previous conviction for domestic violence and yada yada yada and all that s***

746
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:04,351
That doesn't mean I want I'm okay or it's not a tragedy that he got murdered

747
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
Still a f****** murder

748
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Right

749
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,983
Disgusting an awful and you should just be able to

750
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Say

751
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Murdered

752
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
For being black

753
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
Rihanna anti honest way

754
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
Can't do

755
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,695
Compelling

756
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,535
Sort of reports on it alongside another story

757
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
Where black you

758
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
Beat up

759
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
Really related at all

760
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
Covering that story to talk about

761
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,039
Story

762
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Black people white people

763
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Right

764
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,903
Shawn Mendes

765
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,023
But it's okay cuz they're white

766
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
Weird

767
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Nothing like

768
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Cuz I can't

769
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,663
How's your parents while you're off having fun you're going to be there too

770
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
What

771
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
What is happening

772
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Door

773
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
YouTube videos explained

774
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Picture of the devil

775
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:40,863
So I don't I don't know what Alex is trying to prove here although that is a facetious babe I know exactly what he's trying to do

776
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,751
This story is about a twenty-year-old the history of unspecified mental illness Westwood Nursing Center

777
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:52,127
It's awful and I'm not making excuses for this kind of thing it's never okay for someone to assault another person

778
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
It does appear that the issues that are relevant to

779
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Consider

780
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,087
The first is the history of mental illness there was a reason

781
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,743
The second is how much of that history was the staff of the hospital

782
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,631
Also in the video the man is clearly saying this guy was in his bed

783
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,703
So it's unclear if it's appropriate to describe a racial motivation

784
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
For this beating

785
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:22,591
A very well may be the case that this guy wasn't as bad knee was just mad at white people that's possible

786
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
I'm not sure I guess

787
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Still alive

788
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
And the attackers facing charges for the beat

789
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
There are tons of stories in the media you can find about this case

790
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
If it's black guy beating up white guy

791
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
I was just telling the story the way he is

792
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:47,423
Because he feels that this is a trump card Ahmad arbery killing was racially motivated

793
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
I find that offensive

794
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
Whatever the case is literally nothing to do

795
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Every situation

796
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:03,039
Also you can just hear an Alex's voice how much more passionate he is about a story like that

797
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,599
Ideas of persecution

798
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,671
Where he feels the most comfortable which is really f***** up

799
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,535
Beat that white ho

800
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,863
What it is

801
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,983
Very much amplifying the brutality one because he likes the boot

802
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,799
That's just the brutality cell

803
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
Yeah exactly because

804
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,431
He is making sure that you think

805
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Look

806
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
Look at how brutal this black person

807
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,295
Violent

808
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
Well hey they were protect

809
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:44,255
Hayward community

810
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
He got

811
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
Till he played in

812
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
He got

813
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,143
And it's a shame I wish I wish

814
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:56,543
27

815
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Peter Peter

816
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Come on

817
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:07,551
The show and Alex interviews that creature ripped at the cease-and-desist order

818
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,647
St Pete I don't care about that interview

819
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
So after that Alex

820
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:19,583
Weird man I don't know if this is the effect of this guy praying on Aaron Alex getting real spiritual

821
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
He said some things I think are f***** up

822
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,087
Get on my knees

823
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
You can actually see everything going on in the universe

824
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,607
Plugging directly in

825
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:58,751
Hey this is all right

826
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:10,015
How is this electoral college

827
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Show me safety on site

828
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
Yeah it's good this is

829
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
God has given him

830
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,119
Listen

831
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
Neutral context

832
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
You know everybody wants a little little add something to their

833
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,231
Although I don't really understand the Constitution would think that y'all about all the time I have no idea what Civics are

834
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
But I'm a psychic

835
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,655
Not just for news that would be okay on like a reality TV show

836
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:04,543
People on the planet

837
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,591
I don't think I've heard anybody on

838
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,663
The Amazing Race

839
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,247
Hey don't worry about this I know you're angry right now

840
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
I can see the next

841
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,927
Clue we're skipping this s***. The answers to the tribal council's in the future

842
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,999
I can predict voting

843
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
God

844
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:35,007
We were granted mean

845
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
That's weird

846
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,567
Another Power

847
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Wheat

848
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
Really see what this looks like

849
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,951
Literally stare the minds of the enemy

850
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
You're going to do it

851
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Pics of the universe

852
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
You're not saying

853
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,639
So

854
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Alex Jones

855
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:21,599
Reluctant telepath

856
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:26,463
God is 462 telepathy

857
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,863
I just wish you was like a fifteenth-century monk who could just plan to wait with a cat-o'-nine-tails that would be so much easier

858
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
That's what he wants

859
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
Duke

860
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
Forcing himself to

861
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
Experience

862
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,495
Interpreting

863
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:44,639
I don't know if that's accurate but I just wish I couldn't see what the enemy

864
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:51,039
Ticket to Read

865
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,855
The most powerful telepath in the world

866
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,879
Where's the

867
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,999
This is where it all gets really funny

868
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
When you look at people

869
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
Rockefeller

870
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
Have sold their soul

871
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Turn themselves over

872
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
They had

873
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Giving up

874
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Humanity

875
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
Connected to something is dead.

876
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
And that's all

877
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Lincoln news

878
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Run around

879
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
Conventional

880
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,439
Their special on their powerful

881
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
They run around a special and Powerful telepathic

882
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,167
Another Bill Gates how are you doing

883
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Stupid

884
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,719
Psychic powers

885
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,815
Office episode give us a glimpse into the future

886
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Mary Claire

887
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
This way

888
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Because

889
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
We had to vent

890
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
God doesn't

891
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
When the whole game

892
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
Up to you God gives it to you

893
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
I'll say this now

894
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,263
Eliza Taylor

895
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
B24

896
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Caramel monsters up

897
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
The harvill

898
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Kobe Bryant

899
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,023
Tens of millions of washers to go knock on doors

900
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
PR

901
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
Everything

902
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,287
Can't get the justice department is our good people there.

903
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,151
Rolls up similar

904
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
Supposed to end

905
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Scares is outside Global Force

906
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
Make them run

907
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,191
Consolidate power prior to the election

908
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,079
Unless he strong-armed his way into the next election

909
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
Probably

910
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
Point number one

911
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
If Trump loses

912
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
It's because everybody else cheated in the election results are illegitimate is brainwasher is going door-to-door

913
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
Mail-in ballots

914
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
Cheating

915
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
Number two

916
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
If Trump starts let's say jailing his political because he's consolidating

917
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Although

918
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
He is consolidating power but it's mainly because he's getting rid of evil

919
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,847
To stop

920
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
Authoritarianism we must

921
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,711
The authoritarian

922
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
This is a good plan

923
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:40,159
Always walk

924
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:51,167
Play the clip of trump talking about how he's going to override the governor's if they don't open up

925
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Churches

926
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
I'm going to do some unconstitutional

927
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,055
Galaxy 7 Anderson take on it

928
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,175
Need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places

929
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,967
Efface to open

930
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Right now

931
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
For this weekend

932
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,135
If they don't do it I will override the governor's

933
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,743
In America we need more prayer

934
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,047
Thank you very much

935
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,727
The Rebellion you should be really against that Alex

936
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Celebrate

937
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:35,455
Ultimate executive power

938
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,551
Just like the Constitution says I should because

939
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
MX Player

940
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,023
This is a long clip

941
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Okay

942
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,399
And it's cuz I wanted everyone to have a taste

943
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
What episode was

944
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:00,031
And I thought this was the most entertaining and also

945
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
Stretch

946
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Alex play some techno music

947
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,663
And rants about the devil

948
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
This

949
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Is

950
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,575
Nothing this is a f****** a killing

951
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,415
Free-will must be tested

952
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,743
Free will

953
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,911
You don't want to do

954
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,543
Free will

955
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,431
Consciousness that God to make perfect robot all day long

956
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Carry out whatever task God wanted

957
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:44,319
Sextus robot created

958
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,951
They passed the test one day we'll stand

959
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,447
Buy supercomputer

960
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,983
Not done by mad scientist

961
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,079
That's not done by Larry Page or Sergey Brin

962
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:11,711
Orchestrated by the creator of the universe

963
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,271
Where we are now

964
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
Billy

965
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,103
Settings long

966
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
You said it was long

967
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:46,527
I think that's how this train goes

968
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,183
Imaginate

969
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,023
Omnipresent because you

970
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,631
Ancestors use omnipresent what

971
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
Dinner Faithfully.

972
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,495
Did we

973
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:12,895
From the very beginning

974
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
Wine Down

975
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
A hole with that you believe that you

976
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
What

977
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,975
What are we doing

978
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,791
Wasn't already it's real

979
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:40,287
Believe you were King believe you are the author of the universe

980
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
What's the potential for conscious

981
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,991
Sure

982
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,319
I'm so high

983
01:03:54,111 --> 01:04:00,255
Transcendence but you rejected the very force that created you naturally

984
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
So because of that

985
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,351
Why they call you the Fallen

986
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Without the wind

987
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,495
Call man

988
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
Music store

989
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
Humanity

990
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Believe

991
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,431
Cut off the universe

992
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
You are a god

993
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
Georgia

994
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,599
Discussion

995
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,695
Dershowitz

996
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:44,287
Interview with the Sovereign citizen guy

997
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
I got this ticket

998
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
And I went to the court and I went to

999
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
I said

1000
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
I'm not going to take you

1001
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:55,551
And all the while playing underneath it is just some swelling godspeed You black Emperor music and God it would be so

1002
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
So much better if it was a lie

1003
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,631
Why you why you doing other than you enjoy talking over music

1004
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,679
Like that's the only thing that is

1005
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,263
Just being ran out of music

1006
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,663
And then like 10 seconds later the outro music

1007
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Alan dershowitz

1008
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
So

1009
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
Stupid

1010
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
That's pretty great

1011
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,071
What I wanted

1012
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
Why do feel

1013
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:45,471
What episode is Alaska

1014
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
And honestly like

1015
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,359
I wasn't even going to cut that clip at all I was listening to it

1016
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:04,159
The weather like

1017
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
I'm falling asleep

1018
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,679
Watco too long

1019
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,079
You talked about how you doing

1020
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,871
At the inauguration

1021
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,151
Sure

1022
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
And you get sent

1023
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,247
How a little bit later and it's trouble

1024
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,807
I was there on January 20th

1025
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
2017

1026
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
Present

1027
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
The secret technology that are suppressed

1028
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Truly are March the star

1029
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Speed Trump

1030
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
You know right

1031
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:02,271
Is it totally a true story

1032
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:08,671
Sounds like a very true story

1033
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,463
Without God

1034
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Haven't

1035
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,095
So I don't believe that story

1036
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
Restored the New York Times reporters Alex

1037
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:37,343
Would they still growling problem

1038
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
Miracle cures

1039
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:44,511
Those eyes those technologies that were going to be revealed

1040
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
So Alex complains

1041
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,143
Do you want

1042
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,215
Controller

1043
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,775
Hydroxychloroquine

1044
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,567
You in control

1045
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
You turn CNN on

1046
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Don't say that

1047
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,767
Sprouts

1048
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:23,167
How's it going May 22nd

1049
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,471
It looked at the fatality rates across six continents

1050
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,799
The people who were taking hydroxychloroquine

1051
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,359
Guardian article

1052
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:37,503
Taking drugs with higher than among people who were not given up

1053
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Too good a cure

1054
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:45,183
Taking the drugs died

1055
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,535
If it were on hydroxychloroquine an antibiotic

1056
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,375
Drugs with 1 and 11

1057
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,287
This wasn't formal studies of there aren't variable controls in place of the differences of death rates may not be as big as those numbers

1058
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,943
But the studies say allowing for these differences there was still higher mortality among

1059
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
Those taking the drugs

1060
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,295
More and more evidence is mounting that this is not a good drug

1061
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
To be boosting

1062
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Covid treatment

1063
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,647
Alex is still on that the hill

1064
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,303
He's so desperate to defend the stupid things Trump says he's willing to support an unproven treatment

1065
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,375
I love Trump is off base on this one I don't know what he's doing

1066
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,191
Really sad

1067
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
For someone who's like

1068
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:34,591
You know I'm a free thinker I'm outside the box all you sheep all you people with followers

1069
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:38,175
I will do that literally anything this dumpster

1070
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
You know like

1071
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,391
Remember all the drugs that are developed over time with imported scientists they aren't just like

1072
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,183
A politician comes out and says

1073
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
Take them

1074
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Those are all the good drug

1075
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
Those are all the good one

1076
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:58,399
Send interesting Axiom politician

1077
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
Hate this

1078
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Not good

1079
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
I'm going to go I'm just going to say that right now that I didn't take it

1080
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:13,503
The first words of the Constitution are Congress shall make no law restricting the president

1081
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
Pushing some b******* on people

1082
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
Alex

1083
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,623
The president is Free Speech

1084
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,391
Cool

1085
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,975
So I know you're probably wondering

1086
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,511
How did Alex know

1087
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
What tropical

1088
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,071
Going to stay at the inaugural was not wandering

1089
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
You weren't

1090
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
Telephone

1091
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
Somebody slap him

1092
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,343
Picking it up

1093
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,391
You got

1094
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
Pray for Trump

1095
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
The middle

1096
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
We're here what

1097
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
The pier is a reverse

1098
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
We're here

1099
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
A geyser

1100
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
What

1101
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
You don't even know that

1102
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Now

1103
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
Scared

1104
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Okay

1105
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Here's a

1106
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:29,535
If he can talk to Trump without the use of a phone he's definitely applying telepathic communication

1107
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
National Security

1108
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,887
No doubt he is and he's got all of the secrets

1109
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,471
You could just tell the path in there all the time

1110
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
Other countries need to be kidnapping Alex Jones reading his mind for all the Trump Secret

1111
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:50,271
Secrets is just like ice cream

1112
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:58,719
What the f*** is this

1113
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
That's

1114
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:04,607
Telepathic

1115
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
So I am

1116
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:13,311
Definitely implying that there's a telepathic connection with him and truck with

1117
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Upset

1118
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,895
And then the other thing is super exciting there is that

1119
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:21,503
He's definitely saying that God is here we're here in Trump is in the middle

1120
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,831
And that seems to be Jesus's

1121
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:29,951
It's one thing to consider but it's basically like

1122
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,583
Kingship this is what you say about like

1123
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:40,703
Someone is divinely ordained to be your ruler conduit through which

1124
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,335
It's exactly the early early church was

1125
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:50,687
The priest was the only one who could speak your goddamn convey the messages

1126
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
From the holy of holies

1127
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,087
Like hell it was only two Japanese Emperors ago and they were the conduit for God

1128
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
So

1129
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,439
It's

1130
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,207
Republic

1131
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,255
Democratic Republic

1132
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
View

1133
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:09,119
Of the ruler

1134
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
Are the Justified

1135
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,007
A peaceful transition of power away from

1136
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,847
God's chosen president

1137
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
I mean there's two possibilities either he is lost

1138
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
And whoever wins

1139
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
Skip

1140
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,671
The Mandate of Heaven is so clumsy that I'm done by

1141
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:38,047
Human echinacea that God doesn't really have much of much of the Swing on this one

1142
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,375
He can be he can be knocked out every 4 years

1143
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:45,471
If Alex's is there I mean what are we doing

1144
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:52,127
This this guy is as the realm of acceptable

1145
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,943
You should be ashamed

1146
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
So Alex that plays the eclipse

1147
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,807
I believe it is very

1148
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:04,927
He does it again plays the clip of trump talking about opening up the churches

1149
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,023
Interpretation of this is real funny

1150
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,631
Need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential

1151
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Places

1152
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
Aphasia

1153
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
To open

1154
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,239
Right now

1155
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
For this weekend

1156
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:23,615
Did they. They don't do it I will override the governor's

1157
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,199
In America we need more prayer

1158
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,807
Did you just hear that teeth never said override

1159
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Aegis

1160
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
The owner

1161
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
When the federal government override

1162
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,719
It is the first

1163
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
Or second

1164
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
40% of you either

1165
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303

What are you f****** talking

1167
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,031
The only dog that only the first few amendments

1168
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:56,639
Only a few Amendment allow the government to do

1169
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:04,319
Christ making stuff in order to try and make it

1170
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
Guzma contradicts

1171
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:11,743
Really extreme 10th Amendment ship from back in the earlier days

1172
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,399
Shawty rationalization of

1173
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,959

Shame I like seeing when people experience for saying s*** like that

1179
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:42,207
I feel physically bad after saying something they completely compromised everything I've ever espoused in my entire

1180
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,743
I feel bad about the

1181
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,303
Yeah actually we are not there anymore

1182
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,095
Just say that s***

1183
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,655
Brianne rollock

1184
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
Lord Rothschild

1185
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,335
We've covered a large part of that like

1186
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:02,943
2009. Off the show where he was like

1187
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
He was having

1188
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,039
State legislators on Ricky

1189
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
Resolution

1190
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,159
He was he was talking about

1191
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,207
Constitutional Convention

1192
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:17,791
Yeah I got kind of ridiculous

1193
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Picture of this

1194
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:22,911

1195
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
God damn man

1196
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
You would hate yourself

1197
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,847
You would be Your Own Worst Enemy

1198
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895

01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,431
Backwood be second

1200
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,991
To your future self

Very sad

1202
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
Together a

1203
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
What is like a

1204
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:50,303
Debate between new Alex and old Alex and just have them argument other all day

1205
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:56,703
Thinking about you I don't have the time and enterprising

1206
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
Yeah I don't have the time

1207
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Focus on putting out

1208
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
3

1209
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:11,039
12 hour episodes per week instead of making one thing that will go viral

1210
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,575
It's an issue person

1211
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
That is a problem

1212
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:20,511
Our last episode on Friday said that he prayed with somebody,

1213
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
This comes up again

1214
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,679
Person

1215
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
The devil

1216
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,015
Like four years ago was telling me how much you love Jesus

1217
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,319
God

1218
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,415
Patrick the f*** out of here

1219
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
We all know.

1220
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
What

1221
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
Do you like like

1222
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,239
Lord's Prayer

1223
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,807
Rodger

1224
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,671
Yeah I don't know why you playing so close to the vet

1225
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,999
Probably cuz they also committed a crime during up

1226
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,839
Maybe attorney-client

1227
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:33,215
Give me

1228
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:37,311
Congress shall make no law restricting my prayer for crier

1229
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,151
Sure we planned the crime so

1230
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,711
Admissible in court

1231
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
The First Amendment

1232
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,551
Yeah I know cuz Alex has talked

1233
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
Praying with Rodger Rodger to God

1234
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,999
Like you would be playing this game

1235
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:02,399
We're on multiple episodes it was Rodger but maybe he's just not supposed to

1236
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:09,055
Probably tired. Not allowed to talk about you forgot you said

1237
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,127
That about Rodger

1238
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,687
Possible

1239
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,039
So we know that Alex is really bad with Thomas Jefferson quote

1240
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
How does he do

1241
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,159
No he's not he's very bad with

1242
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,439
How do they do it

1243
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,999
Quotes from outside of the United

1244
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:31,839
Well if it's a non-white person I bet he's going to Tribute to a white person

1245
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,375
There's no choice in this life

1246
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Gentleman

1247
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,935
HUD

1248
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,543
You think you're on this planet.

1249
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Game

1250
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,151
You think it's about watching TV

1251
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,759
No man this is about your soul you're a sentient creature

1252
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
You have like Mahatma Gandhi said

1253
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,439

That is

1256
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Then you start

1257
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Playing game

1258
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,640
Very weird

1259
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,920

I don't know any our souls are the seeds or the universe or

1263
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:35,328
Doesn't sound like

1264
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,936
I couldn't find anything I don't know if it's a real quote

1265

Regulators require that manufacturer show a product is safe before it goes into people

1309
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
Researchers almost always check

1310
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
Before putting Cuban volunteers of potential risk

1311
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:15,584
How much does making up that there's a lob be uncommon

1312
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:21,728
You are uncommon circumstances were in right now that there are potential dangers

1313
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:26,592
They could come from skipping any kind of step in normal process

1314
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:30,432
I'm certainly not in a position where I have enough awareness to understand

1315
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:36,064
What kind of calculus people are making me learn from the animal trials

1316
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:42,464
That we might not be riding out cruel or animal child. What you doing

1317
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,536
Factor those out as a boy

1318
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
I don't know enough

1319
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
The number of articles

1320
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,936
There's no law

1321
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
And

1322
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,496
People who have

1323
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,800
Familiarity with the topic

1324
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,848
Understand

1325
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
If you do the normal route it'll be 10 years

1326
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
What is Vice Ganda

1327
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
And

1328
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
You don't want to wait 10 years.

1329
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:16,512
I don't know what the risk if there is a situation

1330
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,072
Ends up position where something

1331
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:23,936
Really unexpected and negative better to take

1332
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Your time to do things

1333
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,640
I'm not sitting here whatever vaccine

1334
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,040
This is our lives

1335
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:45,440
They they understand those concerns that I might think of in my head when I try and look for

1336
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
Perspective

1337
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,024
But I have her pretty well

1338
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,840
Yeah it seems like

1339
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,120
Now I'm just

1340
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
I'm just spitballing

1341
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,960
You and I probably aren't the guys to make that

1342
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,520
Kind of call cuz we don't really know enough

1343
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,640
Say that that would be true for many

1344
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:09,248
So what we should do is allow people for whom that area is there expert

1345
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
To make those

1346
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,296
Decisions

1347
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,880
That makes sense right I think we can all agree that that's a good idea

1348
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,696
So why can't we agree that that's a good idea

1349
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,976
Because some people are angry

1350
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,216
I was going to say it's a rare glimpse into Alex's bad boss

1351
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,104
This one is particularly

1352
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
Because

1353
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,992
A bad boss

1354
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:44,576
He's actually kind of a kind of undercut some of his beliefs

1355
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
Back to Sunday by the way

1356
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,256
For 6 p.m. central doing that Sunday show live

1357
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
The cruise trying to talk

1358
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
Me I'll do an immortal Day live

1359
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
So your day off

1360
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,376
Job

1361
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
Will will will will see what happen

1362
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,800
Yeah well that you're going to be there on Memorial Day and making your staff work

1363
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
I think you're going to get

1364
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:11,968
DES office for what

1365
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,992
Broadcast

1366
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,808
Or I'm going to yell at weirdos

1367
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,416
So I don't know

1368
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,464
That great

1369
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,816
The fact that he did

1370
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,168
First of all

1371
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
Explicit

1372
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
Lily said that Alex was lying

1373
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,944
Psychic entity believes

1374
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:49,344
If we got to sit through a three-minute rant about the devil to get there I think it's worth it

1375
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,024
So what do you think he's what do you think is favorite X-Files X-Files the last guy or a

1376
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:06,496
DVD codes for The X-Files

1377
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,872
I think his favorite X-File is

1378
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,968
Captain America

1379
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:22,368
Sure there are a lot of

1380
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:41,568
I just really really like you would like a

1381
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,968
Mdzs I am the juiciest Ice Cube

1382
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Holding

1383
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,392
Alex
