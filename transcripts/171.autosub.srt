1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,640
Novels about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Hey

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,528
I was

5
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
If I were

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:30,720
Use the subjunctive

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
Someone utterly unfamiliar

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Love

9
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Okay

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Just

11
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,336
Just the general sense that life could be better I would say first of all the passive voice

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
Bisquick tacular

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
I would say this

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,000
Absolutely

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Security First

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
Episode just got to address

17
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
In the room

18
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Record on Monday night got to a little bit of a row a little bit of a fight

19
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,384
If people were watching are going to listen to the show that I feel like it's

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
Appropriate address we should at least

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
I got a couple message

22
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,624
They were nice from people like me like they don't worry about stuff

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
Should I wasn't mad at you

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
I wasn't mad at you interrupting

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
Spikes

26
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Expensive liquor

27
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,680
In the chat room they have a drinking game and I physically have to wait to talk

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
So like it's not

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,592
It's not that I'm unfamiliar with that dynamic between us or even that it bothers

30
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
But I think a lot of people might not like Danny Jordan responding

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Oh my God.

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
We're having a conversation

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
What about the children

34
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Concentration

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Concentration

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Excuse whatever language

37
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
You prefer

38
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Seems fitting

39
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
But you were talking about how

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
You aren't sure if

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
This is really that new

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
Atrocities with the United States

43
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Of course

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Other countries but

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
It isn't that

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Agree with you

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Because

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
I don't

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Necessarily think

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
After we turned off the recording was what I was

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Get to say

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Which was

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
The lack of adjust

54
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Certifiable

55
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
The nation

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
For this

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Deniability

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
When a drone

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Accidentally

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
Kill the child

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
2A Mediterra

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Like there's some sort of psychological buffer that

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
In your head

64
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
That allows you to like move on

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
No

66
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
Abject

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Cruelty

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,488
So you are making your point and I tried to butt in

69
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Disagree with it

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
To make

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
ORD to sort of

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Include that in the conversation

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
Mmu steamed

74
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,032
Right through there should be no government

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
Bad idea

76
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Like that

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,088
I didn't get to say the thought that I wanted to say I just disagreed with you on your road right

78
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
Alright

79
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
That was going to paint me in the box like I've

80
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
That I was a

81
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
A Centrist on

82
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Children

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Freedom

84
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
And I'm not thrilled right

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
I can take it when someone wants to like

86
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
My love

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Like I can

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
I really am

89
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
This situation in this story

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
I've no interest

91
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
I have no time for it

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Even people who mean it well

93
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
And none of this is to say that you were intentionally

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
Behaving in a way

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Braided it's not mad at you

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm not mad at the hypothetical list

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
I was just super frustrated and before Levi throw my head

98
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
When I'm trying to think through that thought witches

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Which was something that I've been thinking about the whole day

100
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
I could tell you were doing

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
I was just trying so hard to get to like this this

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Reconciliation

103
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Because you're absolutely right

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
One of the big reasons that this is so much

105
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
Is despite all of the cruel acts that America has

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Committed

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
And continues to come

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
This one is just

109
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,263
So it isn't different and yet it is so massive

110
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
Different

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
To sit down and

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Got to be another

113
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Yeah

114
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
Dispatch In Our Lifetime

115
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
It does

116
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Feel unique

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Kaleisia tea

118
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
I'm not I'm not right

119
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
I'm fine saying that acting on it now I probably need to sit with those feelings

120
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
For a little while

121
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
Know if I fully support that

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
I'm not sure if it matters

123
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
You know it

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
It's hard and in the other thing I think is

125
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Particularly hard about it

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Is it like

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Not to say we

128
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
We called this or anything like that

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
We've gone over over and over again

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Hey Alex Jones is representative of this

131
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Tired

132
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Voice of white mask

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,231
Nationalism what you're seeing is other ring of particularly Muslims and immigrants

134
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
It feels really terrible

135
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
Because I couldn't

136
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Stop anything like temperature right now

137
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Mark feeling of

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Surrounded

139
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
That is kind of a bummer

140
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
I don't I don't know if that

141
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
Place of ego

142
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
It just kind of everything everything really sucks

143
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
What

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
The feeling of the inability to

145
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Like even a desperate

146
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Situation

147
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Right

148
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
The ability

149
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Feels feels

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Do does that rally

151
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Protest that'll be taking place there's organization

152
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,319
Yeah couple of organizations that I

153
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
It feels desperate even

154
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Haven't done

155
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
It doesn't feel like you're really make a difference

156
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
It does matter

157
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
It doesn't matter

158
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Do something

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Figured what Alex Jones

160
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Kate is

161
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Feeling a powerless

162
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
In the face

163
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Giant

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
The Behemoth evil

165
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
That's stupid

166
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
Direct action is always possible

167
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Even if it feels like it does nothing

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Should do some

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,575
Well that's one of the organization that I that I looked into two

170
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Today that

171
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
I will stay

172
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
A couple of

173
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
That I research that are direct action you know they're not like the Red Cross where they have an operating budget

174
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Or anything like

175
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
That like I don't f*** around with that

176
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
The first was the legal age

177
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Which is entirely devoted to

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
You getting

179
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Migrant children

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Represent a

181
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
If you because if they've been separated from their parents

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
70% of them or something like that have nobody

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
No representation they have more milk or

184
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
Necessarily

185
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
And then the other one

186
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
And then the other one was I think it's I think it's actually becoming popular

187
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
CES

188
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,431
The big reason that I like them a lot is because they are putting it not to

189
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Just words

190
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Legal defense but also

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Toward a permanent

192
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Baleful

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Spray Urban

194
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
You like if it cost five grand to get out of

195
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Prison Tuesday

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
And you don't have five Grand Avenue

197
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
You stay there

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
With this permanent Bond Fund

199
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Because Bond aren't

200
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
You know it's not like a perch

201
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
If everything goes well you get the money back

202
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
So if a bond is setups

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Sufficiently

204
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
It can operate

205
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Definitely

206
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
And

207
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
That's one of the big things that I I feel like we should do

208
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
The other thing is I think

209
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
We should all be

210
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
And what

211
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
That was a

212
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
9 Minutes of our episode

213
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Bailing

214
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
On the episode

215
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Because

216
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
We revealed I will reveal in a moment Project Camelot episode

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Kind of negative Cloud hovering over

218
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
What's supposed to be a jolly good time

219
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,927
Yeah we are we are absolutely going to enjoy the f*** out of

220
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
I can't wait you might actually not

221
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
Because because of how much I'm going to enjoy

222
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
It hits all this passive voice

223
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Get onto two things that I've done

224
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Fence Atlanta

225
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
313 in

226
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
The past

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
And it just happens to converge in one person

228
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,783
Perfect you fall in love with the city of

229
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Thank you so much everybody on Friday

230
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Reviews of the wild episode

231
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,631
Those positive reviews would be impossible

232
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Helped us

233
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Set up

234
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Absolutely

235
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,127
Before we could go on like to I instead of thinking any donors

236
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Today like to give

237
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Thank you

238
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
Books in Austin

239
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Facilitated the

240
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Along with

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
You pick the perfect Apple

243
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
That's not it

244
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Because much of the work is get at coordinating

245
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Master Bethel

246
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
The people on the ground in Austin

247
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
John Duggar

248
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
Rory

249
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,079
Everybody on the ground who made that show possible

250
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
It was

251
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
It was the most fun

252
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Nerve-wracking

253
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Couple of days

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
I think of my entire

255
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,135
Quadrumvirate

256
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Rocketeers

257
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Three Musketeers

258
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
Because of their I help it was

259
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Spectacular

260
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
Recognition of that I would like

261
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Officially

262
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Jesus Christ

263
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
How to read

264
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
I am out of control

265
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,551
Abused by white people

266
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,159
Joseph Stalin

267
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Thank you so much

268
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Austinites

269
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
So prophetic

270
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,287
Is it his admiration for Hitler and Stalin as being complete badasses in your life

271
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,431
Well he's being facetious and then we get our own and

272
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
Hitler and Stalin were white

273
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
That's true

274
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,135
Let's go

275
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,839
Was doing the world is all this Holocaust

276
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
You'll be like

277
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
It's all just

278
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
It's all babies.

279
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Minimize that

280
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Stop and I'm sure Alex

281
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
I don't want to hear anybody

282
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Talking about

283
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Force

284
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
I don't give a s*** I don't want to hear about space force from him

285
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Because I have other people to tell me about it

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
Nll tell you something about our

287
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Jedi work

288
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Okay it's not just

289
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Chilling

290
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
Snapchat

291
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
But you learn and I see episode 1 of Game of Thrones

292
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
Somebody's got to kill and will you put it

293
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Yourself

294
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
He was

295
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Jedi

296
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,759
Episode of The Project Camelot Hellyeah

297
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
And every episode

298
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Exact same way

299
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Kerry Cassidy

300
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
So we will never forget

301
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,303
That is not a gas station

302
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,655
Hi everyone I'm Trey Cassidy from Project Camelot and

303
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
Very happy to be here tonight I have a very

304
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Good

305
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Old friend

306
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,175
Haven't heard or seen from him in a long time and one of my conferences

307
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
He's a wonderful researcher

308
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
An investigator and dinna bring him on

309
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Stream here now Steven Kelly

310
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Steven say hello to everyone

311
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
I carry

312
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,095
Join the club

313
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
She's she's really excited

314
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Fiona

315
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
She's good means if she's excited

316
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
You can tell by the sound of her

317
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Either he's a wonderful research

318
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
Wonderful monotone

319
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
What are you got

320
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
I don't know how to put this into work like

321
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,975
Cuz you know what every single time we meet a new person through Project Camelot answer my responses

322
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
We found a real crazy.

323
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
Like I always think we've outdone ourselves in terms of really unique

324
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Version of crazy

325
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
The random pants

326
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
I think he's crazier than a diamond gusset

327
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
He gives me multiple feeling

328
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,439
Where is Mike Epps other people like a

329
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Because we like

330
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
Pictures of murderer and

331
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,191
That's all I got on that Kramer

332
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Not that other space pilot guy

333
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Cuz he had a

334
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Do nothing

335
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
Decade in his twenties and now he's like actually I was in space

336
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Brought me back to life

337
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Got to reclaim

338
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Sometime

339
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
I get it

340
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
This guy Steven Kelly

341
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Is like I got

342
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
So many feelings about him

343
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:46,335
I prevail

344
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Going to be a mess

345
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
But here the full gamut of human emotion today

346
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
If you

347
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
I get up to Jedi

348
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Padawan

349
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
2 carats

350
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Again

351
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
She tries to like

352
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
She tries to distance

353
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Self

354
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
From some of his ID

355
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Immediately

356
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
I was going through my library and I realized that somehow

357
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Audio interviews with you seem to have disappeared

358
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
And we did get hacked

359
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
We don't know what happened some of the radio shows they disappeared so I thought I'd bring it back on

360
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,775
It may seem like we're going over old business but it's still current so it's all good

361
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
Yeah well you know I think it's been was November

362
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
2012

363
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
When you know the whole

364
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
2012 2012 2012 path of this when I really came out with us and I think that's when you leave the key

365
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,255
So yeah

366
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
Actually I quit before that we were in touch but

367
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
It's been awhile so I can play

368
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Subway

369
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
It's her so it's been awhile

370
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319
Which is not a good well it's because he kept saying

371
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Because he's coming back

372
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,071
He has not like that tip even though it's all good

373
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,455
It's agencies just like 9

374
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Memes exactly

375
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
He's doing that

376
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Either

377
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
He knows it was wrong but now he has such a good sense of humor about himself that he's like one of myself for it

378
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
A lot of people do

379
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
The predictions were wrong

380
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
But there was like a wave of waking up

381
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
What happened

382
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
On December 20th

383
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,895
December 21st 2012

384
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
What's the date of the beginning of the Awakening

385
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Still happening

386
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Also

387
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,047
How is that relate to the end of the world

388
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Oh okay

389
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Just nonsense

390
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,199
Christmas December 21st

391
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Right

392
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,463
It's the beginning of the new phase in the Mayan calendar and everybody okay

393
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
The cycling over of a new

394
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
The age of Aquarius

395
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Full

396
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
It's wet.

397
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Rationalize

398
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
The Doom p***

399
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
Around what time

400
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
Who's coming back

401
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Hit the world

402
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:40,063
So

403
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Crazy

404
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
This point

405
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
We get

406
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Steve

407
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,607
Ssb4 credits respect

408
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Hey

409
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,703
Like I've spent a lot of time with this guy

410
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
Alright

411
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Discredit

412
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
Pretty familiar thing

413
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
So anyway you are a

414
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,647
What you call yourself is a next contractor for the NSA and CIA

415
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
Can you explain that in a little more detail

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
Alright real quick that means I am not a

417
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
Agent CIA agent shr9

418
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,240
Withdrew I never work for Langley Randy's places like that what I did do as I

419
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
Was a contractor I worked in Bilton

420
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
Was unemployed for these the Cowboys agencies that they set up on the side out there and and of course

421
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
The CIA when they do

422
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
Operations of half the time they're made everything everybody is disposable the whole operation is disposable Cyrus one of the

423
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
Disposable people then of course

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
I got involved with the Ollie North people

425
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Of course right of rice

426
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
Iran-Contra

427
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
I wasn't Expendable guy and then Oliver North

428
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,304
It is because there's so many

429
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Soda

430
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,960
Enough people have had to go on record

431
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
This is real but also lie about

432
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
The exact details are right

433
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Like this wiggle room

434
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
People who will never tell

435
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
The whole truth

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,040
But there are enough truth is out there that you like I was ever

437
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,648
But you don't ever be able to confirm it but it is so much more credibility than to say I was in

438
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
That's why they play this game

439
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
The same reason

440
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Why you would say

441
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
I'm a part of the NSA I wasn't NSA contractor

442
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Deny that

443
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
Instead of saying like I'm apart of

444
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
XYZ program

445
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Like

446
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
You're just making up

447
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,760
What years make up a program

448
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Careywood believe

449
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,856
General stores

450
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
I don't know if you knew this actually had a secret space program

451
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,048
General Dollar

452
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,376
That's the weird thing about the name they trick people

453
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
Dollar General dollars

454
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Ordered

455
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
So many of us and I was only born

456
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
I was just bored because of the way that the Dollar General works

457
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
I'm out I'm out I ran out of

458
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
General Dollar

459
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
That's fun

460
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Do some reason

461
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
North

462
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
This guy.

463
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Two other people I've heard on

464
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Project Camelot

465
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
Stream you guys know each other then like wait

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Like

467
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
Dysentery

468
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
He's business

469
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Right right

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Right

471
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Right

472
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Right

473
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
Which is why Oliver North is now the head of the NRA

474
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:45,568
But the only way into the future

475
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Write an spacebattles

476
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:51,200
With lasers and they're going to run at legal lasers

477
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
I don't think

478
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Caesar like

479
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
Worley

480
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
The only thing I've seen that

481
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Gunsight

482
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
Targeting laser

483
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
You find any

484
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Proof

485
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
He even knows

486
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Anything

487
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
But like

488
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,592
Higher land Blazers

489
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,200
AMU put it in through is what

490
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
It's so like light

491
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
Whatever you understand about life

492
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Steve was involved

493
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
With Ollie North

494
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
Loving you calling him Steve Cove Court

495
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,608
Now would you be surprised to learn

496
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Sirius group

497
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
I am not

498
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
Happy dealing with them I work for the CIA again in but I did get involved with Billy Meier people and all that

499
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
This business for the play against in the UFOs men

500
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:00,064
More crazy stuff with the secret agencies and eventually got

501
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Hooked up to Templars

502
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
Bilderbergers and The People Under The Getty that I call the caver

503
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
Don't really have anything to do with government per se but

504
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,400
First closer to the world the new world order those people

505
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,544
How are you check my watched everyone

506
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
Alright I was originally a contractor working for a cowboy age, blah blah

507
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Now

508
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
Somehow that works out I told her the details

509
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
Take people back

510
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
One time I quit my job movie theater when I was an usher

511
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
I overreacted

512
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
Are you committed treason or whatever

513
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,480
National Disgrace or you're selling cotton working with the CIA

514
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
We are not going to

515
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Bouncing around from Secret Agency

516
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,264
Man-to-man and they were like

517
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
They're swoopy

518
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
So

519
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
What do you know about Billy Meier

520
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Swift

521
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
He's a switch to

522
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
He's a sweetie

523
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
What is a Jedi but not a condom

524
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,752
They wave their hands they make you believe

525
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Here is a UFO

526
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
He's most famous for his

527
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,712
Very easy to the Bronx hoax photos and videos of UFOs

528
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
These photos of General Improvement

529
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
To be just a result of

530
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Take a photo of a

531
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Photo

532
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
And making it look like the exposure was different

533
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
The Flash's difference

534
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
Anime missions are going to be

535
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Hugest

536
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Take pictures of the animation

537
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
I'd say that he took those pictures from a space

538
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
That Greg

539
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
That's pretty awesome

540
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
Or

541
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
Even in America

542
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
He I would take pictures

543
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
News of sci-fi movies that were playing

544
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
And claimed that they were alien

545
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
What's this

546
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
I saw a couple of examples of people found that were like

547
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
All the points

548
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,144
Similarity

549
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
Feel about the Natalie Portman film annihilation

550
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
So one picture

551
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
So good

552
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Hot women

553
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
And two of them

554
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,184
Blurry picture of two of the members of the show girl group the gold diggers

555
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
From one of the Martin show

556
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
There's a huge mess

557
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,984
His videos purporting to show UFOs in Acts

558
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
To know the product of him making little model

559
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
And using Force

560
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Perspective

561
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Cinematographer

562
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Explain how he does it and his ex-wife

563
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Come out and pointed out that in one of his most famous videos

564
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,064
Do you recognize their homes trash can is being part of the spaceship

565
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
So you don't know

566
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,512
This is what we're dealing dealing with a guy who has big dreams

567
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
You got Big Dreams

568
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
And everybody is just pulling him down

569
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
You need do you need pump

570
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
The brakes on that cuz that's how it feels right now

571
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
So are you

572
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
Contact with aliens

573
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
For decades at least dating back to like a 19

574
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
40

575
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
Detox to art

576
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,088
Is oldest

577
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
Most people he talks to

578
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
To talk to RAV4

579
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,024
Course the website Billy Meier UFO research

580
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Dot-com

581
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Amazing archive

582
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,728
And not surprisingly what you find is a veritable Gold Mine of fraudulent prediction

583
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,568
Mixed in with things that never happened

584
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
Predictions

585
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
For example 1975

586
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
It was in 1977

587
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
But the prediction mysteriously was never printed until 9

588
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Yeah

589
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Tons of stuff like that

590
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,512
Was he wrote it on envelope in invisible ink and then put it in a bag

591
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Deposit

592
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,120
That way he wouldn't alter the the future

593
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
As it occurred

594
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Brighton team knew what was going to happen

595
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
That when they were exchanging one of their ball the time

596
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
Invisible ink envelope

597
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
This is awesome I got the face

598
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
So what do you think about Billy Myers

599
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208

603
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
He claims with a German guy sent him a fragment of a text

604
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
He bought me gif

605
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Black Market that said quote

606
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576

And in this Mission I will once again amongst

Alright Muhammad

613
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336

Do I Shall Serve the People and Prophets seven times

615
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
Until their way of thinking

To that of the Creations law and directed to the police

617
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Astounded

618
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,744
And confirmed it to be accurate at about 8500 years old

619
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Accurate

620
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,096
8500 years old you know it's

621
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:41,216
Crazy as there is,

622
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
So many Buddhas and then gym

623
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,224
The great Buddha Buddha Buddha like colloquial Adventure

624
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
Familiar Astro

00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:01,696
Tyrus text from 8500

626
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,536
8500 years ago

627
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
So you know the next

628
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
That this is this is on the down low

629
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
But the next Dalai Lama

630
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Davie

631
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Davie the Dalai Lama

632
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Aiden

633
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
Braden Braden Braden is actually spelled

634
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
Dude is that like behind the extent

635
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
Harmless UFO fun

636
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,416
He tells his followers of the end times are near

637
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
Is clearly fake photos and videos

638
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Proof

639
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
He is the all-powerful aliens

640
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
The chosen to guide

641
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,912
Needless to say he scared a lot of people

642
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Super duper rich

643
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
They always give

644
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
Why do they always get rich

645
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
Easy one word

646
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
Scaring people

647
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah I know we be evil we could be so rude

648
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
So rich

649
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,536
The hell we don't

650
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
Alright

651
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:15,168
All that other stuff leads to him

652
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
The cavers

653
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
I don't know if I should

654
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Should tell you

655
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,224
All of what's going on so I'll just give you a broad stroke

656
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Steve

657
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Steve

658
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
He believes that there's an underground city

659
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Cujo

660
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,000
Underneath the Getty Museum

661
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
John

662
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
Piece of evidence

663
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
I don't know if

664
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:57,408
We'll get to his reasoning a little bit later but he believes really feel like you just

665
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Divided

666
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Do you believe there's an underground

667
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
Aliens and

668
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,624
Underneath the museum

669
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
The people who run it are the caver

670
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,048
Isaiah who like the Illuminati and all of them actually report to

671
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
So like the cavers are higher up this

672
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
This is his way of trying to pull rank

673
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,496
People who

674
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,592
Come close to the top of the food savers

675
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,688
The Illuminati's just the foot soldiers of the caver

676
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Gotcha

677
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
You're probably curious about what

678
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
The stuff

679
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,648
When he was going to Steve was at these Cowboys agent

680
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
He was working

681
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
You're probably curious about that

682
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,816
No I'm working

683
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
They called themselves

684
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
Do they call themselves the cameras

685
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
Riddler in Olivette

686
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Cuz I feel like

687
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
Spelunkers would be a better

688
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
All will become clear in

689
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,848
Do time here is what he was working on

690
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,248
I'm still involved with the CIA again but this was for another project involving a big giant flashlight and call the

691
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
Plasma beam

692
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,392
Eventually of course the

693
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,208
At least three times I had

694
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,816
People coming along who I don't really know who the hell they were actually two of them turned out to be

695
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Reptoid

696
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
Oh boy

697
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,752
Work

698
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
Flashlight

699
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
Flashlight

700
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,016
Flashlight

701
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Yeah

702
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,928
Video games

703
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
Because we already have

704
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
Nugent flashlight

705
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
The light that baby up

706
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,288
Is that really what is going on I apologize

707
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,920
He does bring back out another time

708
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,248
Like the context of it is never flashed out you never explained

709
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
What it was for

710
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,184
Who in the world

711
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
Smaller generally speaking

712
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,840
You looking more utility in a small flashlight

713
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Portable

714
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
Especially when you're in

715
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
Cuz you couldn't

716
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,592
Flashlight

717
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,688
Sevilla opening

718
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
Giant

719
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Play that right now

720
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
I'll tell you this

721
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Doesn't come up

722
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Just

723
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
The museum and how there's a

724
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
He was working with

725
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,144
Couple of people I talked about in that book one of them the guy which name is

726
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Vince

727
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
Which was like a Handler

728
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,128
And he died they actually he was a cave or he was like a Handler he was the one that

729
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
The first came up with the word cave

730
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,040
And he was he was one of them he was like work underground at all that

731
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:20,928
He came to me when I was working with the CIA doing the big flashlight project Argo again

732
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Acted like he was like a marketing guy he wanted to come and help me market this project that he was a music

733
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Chandler

734
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
Well actually from day one I knew or something weird about him because

735
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
He didn't speak Lakota English his English was

736
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Used words

737
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,944
The wrong words at the wrong time

738
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
You don't like

739
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,064
When you you meet these guys that aren't real

740
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
But human haven't been human for very long is that they'll do things like they haven't been doing it for very long and in this

741
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
Language of course is one of the clues they

742
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,352
So they can just before literally anybody who doesn't

743
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
The best single

744
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:06,496
Someone who has their second language

745
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
Strip the language really bad

746
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
Or they'll get really excited about the

747
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Skin

748
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
They're not you

749
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
Being in the skin of something new it's a new experience so that they're all running around hoe wow this is such a great

750
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
I really like this

751
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,048
That kind of thing that's usually a giveaway but this particular guy bench

752
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
They killed him I think they killed him because he told me too much

753
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:41,056
What it came up with Kieran stuff and he talked about the underground something and activity York

754
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Heart attack

755
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,456
Alien

756
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Skin

757
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
Restart run around saying I love having the skin that is suspicious

758
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
To get

759
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Refuse what I if I had

760
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Ask him

761
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
You're contending

762
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
That Vince the caver

763
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,512
Who was the

764
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,840
The super creative guy who came up with calling people who live in caves

765
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Capers

766
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
Came to him

767
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
As a Kimber Handler

768
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
First

769
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
He was coming to this guy

770
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,896
With marketing advice for the flashlight

771
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,992
Presumably what is your marketing plan for the big giant flashlight

772
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,600
Your flashlight too small we can help you we can help you with that

773
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
I don't know

774
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Brittany

775
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Is this you

776
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Rihanna's face

777
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Here's why this is brilliant

778
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Because he

779
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,936
Slave just enough track to make it like believable

780
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,288
For someone like Carrie she can walk along with it because he

781
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
He's laid out like I was working on this this

782
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
I met this guy

783
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
He's not drawings

784
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Straight line

785
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Between thing

786
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
I was working on some other project

787
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Show me market

788
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Giant flashlight

789
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,952
This is another thing I was working on

790
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
Right there's a bright there's enough like

791
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Confusion as to like

792
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
Pronoun reference

793
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
So

794
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Have you ever thought to yourself

795
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Why is

796
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
I can't see Venus

797
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
Will you sir

798
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Need a big giant

799
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Right

800
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
It with

801
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Million

802
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Easy payments

803
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
28 million

804
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Sure get a flashlight

805
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
That spans the entire size

806
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,511
And God damn all the goddamn

807
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Here is here's how

808
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,423
Steve knew something was up beyond the guy loving skin

809
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Call the great English

810
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Here is

811
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
How are you doing

812
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
These guys

813
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,895
Clearance

814
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,991
Doesn't make any sense for normal person so that was pretty clearly

815
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
But

816
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
He's good at making

817
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,743
Stats for a normal person

818
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
That is mean to you saying

819
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Stuff like you

820
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
Pretending

821
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Do you like these

822
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Like anybody to talk to Alex Jones

823
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
All of them

824
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
Text Stolen Valor for

825
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
So he's like impressed by the guy's ability to bulshit

826
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
Basically that's what I

827
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,319
Somebody who has clearance that no human being should ever

828
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Experience

829
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Which suggests to me

830
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Who is giving clearance

831
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Is all clearance coming from capers

832
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,375
Clearance flows uphill from

833
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
Alright alright

834
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
WWE really was some sort of CIA or something or something or other

835
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
He never came out and said that the first day I met him he said something about silver he'd even use the word silver he's you

836
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Is non-ferrous metal

837
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
But I knew you was talking about silver

838
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
Non iron metal mean silver

839
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
So

840
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Isis map

841
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
You never said he was

842
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,727
But no mortal being should ever experience he was talking about non-ferrous metals

843
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
CIAA

844
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,359
Colloidal silver

845
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
And Alex Jones

846
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Infowars store

847
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,247
There's a lot of parallels that I'm going to drop

848
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Between

849
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,695
This is one of the more Infowars

850
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,999
People in Project Camelot world

851
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Of benefit

852
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
How similar they are

853
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,263
What I'm hearing from this guy is that he's a far more like

854
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:33,407
Like usually The Crazies

855
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
Everybody else's

856
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
Is doing all of the

857
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
All the fight

858
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
And all that stuff

859
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
And where folks

860
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Pakistan

861
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Expanding Humanity

862
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Kilton

863
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,607
If you'd like he's he's like the guy he's like the the blood guy

864
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
I don't want too much

865
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,871
I just get the vibe from him that he wants to Warrior

866
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,735
Not like a guy who's trying to

867
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,295
He's like on the frontlines fighting

868
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
Spacebattles for you

869
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
Alright

870
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Crazy

871
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
But here I am

872
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
We find out how

873
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
How did Steve wake up

874
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,679
How did he snap out of that program in Voorhees like a happy-go-lucky guy does working for

875
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,287
The CIA Aster

876
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Before that

877
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
This might be what he was working on

878
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
At what point did you

879
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
Kind of soda go down the rabbit hole

880
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,647
And wasn't it your brother

881
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
Yasso Brothers definitely involved

882
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,535
But when you talk about going down the rabbit hole

883
00:45:54,047 --> 00:46:00,191
You know you talked about the Getty let's just say that the big wake-up which is everybody think about the wake up the wake

884
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Moment

885
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:06,335
Who's sitting across the desk from the guy from the NSA guy when they start tell me about the

886
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,711
Slaughtering a village of people in in Honduras in the middle of the jungle

887
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
That's my kind of snapped and realized it

888
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
I was working

889
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
People who weren't that nice and they're capable of

890
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,207
Stealing everything in the village

891
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
I was really naive at that time cuz I thought we were one nation under God and we didn't do those things and it was the bad guy

892
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:35,263
And I thought you know

893
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
They were obviously they didn't deserve to have that happen specially their animals and everything that's when I really snapped

894
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Weird

895
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Estranged

896
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,623
Who gives a s*** if you kill a bunch of people you killed his dog man

897
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
Alive during Vietnam

898
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,303
Also it was the system of

899
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
I believe that

900
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Well that was a

901
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
That way

902
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
People out loud

903
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,151
I think that if I were to take that to me I would say you were live

904
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
A very blessed

905
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
We ignored life before that right

906
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:22,367
But good

907
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,695
And this guy was the first time you were like

908
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
Does Christian Brothers like haha we killed pigs

909
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,935
As eating a bacon sandwich

910
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,287
You can't kill

911
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Mad about you

912
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Twice

913
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
Killing the animals

914
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
How could they do that

915
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Whatever whatever

916
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
Could have could have gone either

917
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,951
Brother

918
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
And now

919
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
Where did the brother

920
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
The Apparently has brother I can't prove it

921
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:13,055
You have to prove literally everything otherwise I don't I don't believe he has a brother

922
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
Suspicious

923
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,687
Find out about his brother a guy named

924
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Who's another guy

925
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,831
Is mentioned in a artifact

926
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Recovered from

927
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
Egyptian black mark

928
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
Absolutely

929
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
This story

930
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Just

931
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,559
This is so convoluted I don't even know how to do

932
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,655
Describe it but this is where we start to get into like him bringing in the veggetti

933
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Story

934
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
The actual

935
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
This is

936
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Is nonsense

937
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:50,431
Yes I went through the processes of learning all these things and getting hooked up to Billy Meier and all this stuff

938
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
Again Billy Meier

939
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,271
And get eleaf my brother on everything

940
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
And what happened is that

941
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,903
She has a friend named Dawn

942
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
Worked with another guy

943
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
Team gym

944
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
In gym

945
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
Was a gifted

946
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:13,727
But he also his father was a high-ranking high-level Mason

947
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
And

948
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,335
Mason City cop killed the father

949
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,175
And then when they kill the father they came to Jim

950
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,759
And it basically handed him the keys to the kingdom

951
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
Which involved

952
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
A box of Cuban cigars

953
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,463
The big expensive house

954
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
The job of

955
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
Trust fund manager for the Getty Museum

956
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,399
Another box of cigars

957
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
But these things do you know

958
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,567
You got understand it's like there's there is Magic involved

959
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
Cigars

960
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Did

961
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,111
Nice house

962
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,255
Museum brave other perks

963
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
And also Magic

964
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,095
Well we'll get to what he means by the magic stuff here in a second

965
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
I love Percival Dawn and Jim

966
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
His brother.

967
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Come back up

968
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
His brother went on a tour of the Getty Museum

969
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Was weird and apparently

970
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,599
Because he's Avenue

971
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
The stories of

972
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
We got

973
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,815
Vincent dog

974
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:50,239
These are all the most mundane white dude names for a secret Global conspiracy that is

975
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Going on since the dawn of time

976
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,127
Navigate to Vista I want to tell you a lot about that

977
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,991
You brought it up in that last

978
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Explain what you mean

979
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,599
By that Magic's remind me about bloodline

980
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:10,719
Everything is Justin e because you got to remember you're talking about people that have

981
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,023
Looking Glass Technology

982
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
White

983
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,351
And I know what you're going to do before you do it

984
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
They knew these people knew that I was going to invented

985
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
3 beam laser

986
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Before I was even in the business

987
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,991
And when the day came that I finally actually invented it and designed it was sitting there at the drafting table drawing

988
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,087
They were standing behind me over my shoulder watching you do it

989
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
And I knew it

990
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
You should like

991
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:46,559
You know you can start to learn those things

992
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
It's all about this psychic

993
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,239
Sure I didn't you become a remote viewer

994
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,799
We'll get into that here in a few

995
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Thanks Gary

996
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,175
What is back on track

997
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,479
So I wanted to learn more about

998
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551

Steven the three beam laser to find out what I can learn about it

1000
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
You know is a lot like

1001
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
All of the

1002
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
Ensign Forrest

1003
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,631
On Project

1004
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
Repeat what he says about him

1005
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
SA

1006
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,103
However if you find these bio

1007
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Animal lover

1008
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
They give you the name of his

1009
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Laser

1010
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
Which is

1011
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
Cayendo

1012
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
Gave me the jump off

1013
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:42,623
Read to learn more

1014
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:49,279
So oshitwaddup this going to be I'm going to I'm going to sit back I'm just going to let this wash over babe

1015
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,863
Information I was able to dig up that on August

1016
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Second

1017
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
2000

1018
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,215
Stephen D kelly file for chapter 7 bankruptcy

1019
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Liquidation

1020
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Howard Hughes company

1021
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
Skate industry

1022
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Reflecting assets

1023
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
The 5000

1024
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
$750

1025
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,919
12000

1026
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
$661

1027
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:13,087
That is such a low stakes laser company

1028
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:19,487
I'd like a little a little bit later that little buddy

1029
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:23,327
Grant 5750 dollars in assets

1030
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
Is reasonable

1031
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Successful company

1032
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,935
For $12,000 in liabilities

1033
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
Is very low for any kind

1034
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
And a company

1035
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,079
After 7 usually end up with much higher

1036
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,407
Bankruptcy

1037
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,551
Equity loan and he was like I can't pay this back pops

1038
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,623
I have other suspicions about

1039
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Without a compass

1040
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
Right that's the walk away from this

1041
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Liquidate it

1042
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
You're able to find

1043
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,447
Cross reference

1044
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,799
With one review on it

1045
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:10,431
This review is from November 4th 2010

1046
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
And it reads

1047
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,039
Crook!

1048
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
He will take your money and parts

1049
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,415
/ firearm and won't return it either

1050
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,463
He won't return phone calls or emails

1051
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,511
He has a history of ripping off the public

1052
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Consider yourself warned

1053
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
So

1054
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
It turns out

1055
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,191
The public with what

1056
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,007
Why did firearm show up in the in the mix there

1057
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
He was selling weapons

1058
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
And weapon accessories

1059
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Business

1060
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
What he said

1061
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,039
He will take your part / firearms

1062
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
What he meant was

1063
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
VSCO

1064
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,695
Was like Hey I'm going to put a laser on your gun

1065
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Yeah and then he just kept

1066
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
Probably sold.

1067
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
You look a little bit deeper you come across a bunch of

1068
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,911
Fred's on gun enthusiast message boards

1069
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
What is that

1070
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,847
Has anyone done business with the laser manufacturer called SK Industries

1071
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
I sent him an inference

1072
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
Steve Kelly

1073
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
An hk53 forearm

1074
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
$350

1075
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
To mount his lasers

1076
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
3 months ago

1077
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
Now he's dropped off the radar

1078
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
Concerned videos

1079
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,767
I've been bamboozled

1080
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
Done

1081
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Bart Allen

1082
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
First one

1083
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,471
Yeah I sent him $300 for an IR laser and you never sent it

1084
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:41,567
I should have caught on when you screening his calls but I wanted to laser so bad

1085
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
I sent you the money anyway

1086
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
Of course he never answered

1087
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Another call

1088
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
Another one

1089
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,783
I sent you money for a laser in October after he got the money stop replying to emails

1090
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,855
And after a few phone calls you stopped answering my calls

1091
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
He seems to be very nice in

1092
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:59,999
Individual to talk to but it would seem he has no intention of supplying the products he advertises

1093
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
Another one

1094
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,887
Really nice guy I know what these are all different people to

1095
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:11,007
If you still get a shout-out

1096
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,847
No reply unable to get any response

1097
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Men are the last one

1098
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
Steve Kelly Byrd me too

1099
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,015
I sent an MP5 repair Plus

1100
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,807
Surefire forend light assembly

1101
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Any Captain

1102
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,367
I'm out over $1,000

1103
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
You're not communicating

1104
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
Anyway I sent a buddy over to his business

1105
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Just get it back

1106
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
A coward wouldn't

1107
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Come to the door

1108
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
This asshat has a lot of Bad Karma

1109
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
Buyer beware

1110
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
So he has a deep

1111
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,655
History is

1112
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Going back

1113
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,031
To these reviews are all

1114
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079
Generally from be like

1115
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
2000

1116
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
The 8th 2009

1117
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
Yeah.

1118
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,991
So i f

1119
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
Liquidate

1120
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
2000

1121
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Course

1122
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
I'm Shady dealings

1123
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,207
I don't want to have you and then it sort of caught up to him

1124
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
On the message

1125
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:07,071
Switchboards beagle

1126
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:11,167
Kind of fine with defrauding guys who won

1127
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
I don't I don't I don't think I want these people haven't done laser but

1128
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,127
The same time I'm pretty big on non scam

1129
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,735
You know when you say you're going to do something you do it as a business

1130
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
If you're a guy

1131
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Google

1132
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
Who can put a laser on my gun

1133
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
I'm super vine with it

1134
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,559
But I think that he probably gets boost

1135
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,839
Credibility

1136
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
I don't know

1137
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
Entirely sure if his career as a as a truth-teller overlaps of his career as a gun

1138
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,335
Scam artist

1139
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,151
I think that something happened

1140
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
And the

1141
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,759
New career

1142
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,343
As someone who might end up on Kerry Cassidy show 911

1143
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
No this is my working Theory

1144
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
But the timeline of his life

1145
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,231
Is such that

1146
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
He got in trouble

1147
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,375
I found a bunch of other stuff

1148
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
I can't really

1149
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
There's another guy names

1150
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Steve Kelly

1151
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,007
Who owns the company called sk9

1152
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,543
I am like

1153
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
If SK

1154
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
Industries

1155
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,431
Right

1156
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
Kelly

1157
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:34,111
Brisky's spell Kelley

1158
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,463
B Simone would be selling Weaponry such a similar business name

1159
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
Do all Kelly still weapons must if you are a few Kelly who listens the show please send us any

So do you make lasers for knives

1163
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
So this is the preliminary stuff I was able to

1164
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
Figure out about him

1165
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919

1166
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271

1171
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,767
Essentially version of all of Alex Jones

1172
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Without the fear of being sued

1173
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Steve-O Twitter

1174
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,935
Something about how they literally eat your

1175
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:26,335
Instead of just saying like making Ally up about that California law about that decriminalizing

1176
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Right

1177
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,735
You just as Governor Brown in California wants to give people Aid

1178
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
Because he's

1179
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Secretly gay

1180
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,087
Parenthetical

1181
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,135
You've been married to a woman for 13 years

1183
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,303

1203
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,823
Alright weird

1204
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,919
He seems to be okay with Alex there's a whole story I need to know

1205
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,039
The other thing that I was able to find out is that

1206
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Steve Kelly

1207
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,183
Well he plays up his CIA credentials

1208
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Haha

1209
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,255
Hugo one

1210
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,047
If it's not the only person

1211
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
He was one of the main people

1212
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
When the first people

1213
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,935
To come forward publicly and make the argument

1214
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
The US created

1215
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:07,199
Even the crazy person Nails in every now and again

1216
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,807
Created the Power vacuum

1217
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,439
You're saying that he actually that he believes America actually uses the shadow wife

1218
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719

1220
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,375
Russia Today

1221
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,823
Potato channel in Iran

1222
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,175
That's alright alright he made the claim as early as 2014

1223
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,759
Immediately made the rounds on the right-wing Bloc

1224
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
Facebook group

1225
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,855

911 group

1227
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
The Deep ties to Alex Jones

1228
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
The path

1229
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
There's an almost 0% chance

1230
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
But I would believe that Alex

1231
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
Did not get the narrative

1232
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
U.s. created Isis

1233
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
Directly

1234
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
From Steven Kelly

1235
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,679
The same is probably true.

1236
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,239
Where does Easter come from

1237
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
They come from Giant

1238
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
Flashlight works

1239
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
How is it

1240
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,151
Why God dammit

1241
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455

You got to keep coming up with new Rod alright

1246
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:34,495
So you're a remote viewer right

1247
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Here's his response

1248
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,431
A remote viewer

1249
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
Well you know where all remote be with real skills

1250
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
The way

1251
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,023
You want to do it

1252
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
You have to ask

1253
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
If you able to

1254
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,191
Okay whatever Chul it is that you need to do the mission that you're doing

1255
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,799
You have to ask for the permission first thing you do is ask for permission to do the mission

1256
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
To be part of the mission

1257
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
And then you say thank you

1258
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,455
And then you say please give me everything I need to complete the mission

1259
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
Including the protection

1260
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,039
And the two wholesome skills and whatever

1261
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,343
And so if remote viewing

1262
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,903
It's really not that hard to do

1263
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
Okay

1264
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,767
I don't know when he

1265
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,863
How to do remote viewing explanation was

1266
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
What you just got to ask to do it

1267
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,983
Home Depot

1268
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,335
I don't believe that remote viewing is real so I have trouble with that but I will say

1269
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
Psychologically

1270
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Describing is a really affect

1271
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Tool

1272
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
Cuz like I thinks it's a lot of times we have

1273
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,527
Ingrained blockers

1274
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
In terms of

1275
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
Productivity

1276
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,111
Getting anything done

1277
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,695
I mean like

1278
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:00,511
Even in terms of like a motivation

1279
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
And stuff like that

1280
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
How to get in shape for you want to exercise

1281
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,167
Like that often times does help to create

1282
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Some sort of like

1283
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727
You know

1284
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,543
Make the Declaration outside of yourself

1285
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,407
Create some sort of like a

1286
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:21,503
The mystical experience about please give me the strength

1287
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,575
Exercise call Fremont

1288
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
You go to the Getty Museum

1289
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:32,511
Laa and offering at the Secret Door

1290
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:38,911
Your talkingshit and I was just trying to make a positive out of it

1291
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
There is a way to

1292
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
To validate

1293
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
Experience

1294
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Pretending to

1295
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
There's something valuable in that

1296
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
I think you can get a lot out of it

1297
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,991
Like I've I've experienced and even in the last like

1298
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,087
Month or so like the power of

1299
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
Telling yourself that

1300
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
You're going to remember

1301
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,743
Like if we're meeting for me it's like a very difficult time motivated

1302
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,047
Myself do when I wake up in the morning right down my

1303
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
That belly

1304
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
Very valuable

1305
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
Pass towards being able to lucid dream

1306
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
When I was younger

1307
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,823
It's very difficult to find that motivation

1308
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,895
I found that it's much easier

1309
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,687
If I tell myself

1310
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
His commitment

1311
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
Is non verbal commits

1312
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
Ben is if it were to

1313
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,087
Some Divine Authority

1314
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,367
I'm going to

1315
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,695
Remember my dreams or allow me to remember

1316
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,975
I don't think it's the One X

1317
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Giving me

1318
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,327
Permission to but there's some sort of psychological

1319
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,679
Jump

1320
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:50,079
Surrender yourself to a higher power

1321
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,919
I don't think there's any I don't I don't think there's

1322
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,671
I understand

1323
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,511
But I also

1324
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,791
I think that's all crazy

1325
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
Maybe you just haven't

1326
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
It's better to a power High Enough

1327
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,471
Cavers go to the gallery

1328
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
So

1329
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
Now we're going to get into

1330
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
Finally going to get

1331
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Thank you

1332
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
But I should tell you

1333
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,711
Listen to something at the

1334
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,527
Beginning of this clip that is very Alex Jones

1335
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
Apposite

1336
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:37,695
Generalization because there's a

1337
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
Janelle Garcia

1338
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
Gene memory

1339
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Race memory

1340
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,631
Yeah there's Jean memory

1341
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:51,519
Cellular memory and then there's also reincarnation so you can have different variations of the stuff

1342
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,079
Show me about my brother

1343
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,151
For quite some time

1344
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:03,551
My brother got recruitment process when we're drinking Jim somewhere into the process where we were briefed

1345
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,111
They realize that Jim was getting free

1346
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,159
And it was when

1347
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
The real quick

1348
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,743
Brazos of us briefing

1349
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
Jimmy

1350
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,351
The cavers realize we were briefing Jim

1351
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,655
We probably might have just told them

1352
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,215
Make no mistake he hasn't

1353
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,055
Explain more of what do you mean

1354
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
But

1355
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,223
We had the remote viewer the first remote viewer go down there into the Getty and see what was down there

1356
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
They didn't know that they knew that happened

1357
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
Because these guys have

1358
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:41,951
Like one of the first levels that you run into when you go down there is kind of like a Hogwarts

1359
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,023
If you will it's it's like a university for

1360
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
People

1361
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,143
Super-Soldiers okay it's a super-soldier university sort of

1362
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,727
Magician placard so the whole nine yards all that stuff

1363
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,799
And their job is to go do all these

1364
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:03,967
Magical things but at the same time they're also acting as the security they're supposed to prevent people like me or whoever

1365
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,247
Amber from going down there

1366
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Causing trouble

1367
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
No

1368
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,135
They're not always able to do anything they're certainly able to

1369
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,183
To see you but the

1370
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,791
They alerted okay so another words when we first met that first

1371
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Excursion down there

1372
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
Almost immediately

1373
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,191
Alarm Bells went off and they all knew that this happened

1374
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
And we were confronted

1375
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,055
This is when things got really serious

1376
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
No it didn't

1377
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
No it didn't

1378
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,687
I don't I don't

1379
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
If I understand correctly the timeline

1380
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Is

1381
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
They were brief and Jim

1382
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Alright

1383
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
I had a weird thought all right

1384
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
Another like

1385
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,583
S*** we got to remote view this

1386
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,399
Yes so they go to the first remote viewer

1387
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:00,799
Which I should say is actually

1388
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Because I watched another lecture

1389
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,455
Alright

1390
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Alright

1391
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,271
Get down

1392
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,319
It's only to the first level

1393
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,879
A university very similar to Hogwarts

1394
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
That trains both super soldiers

1395
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,719
Is similar to the movie

1396
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Soldier

1397
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,303
Black magic

1398
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,583
As well as

1399
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,631
I should tell you

1400
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Of course

1401
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,727
The whole nine yards which I think it's actually means every

1402
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Everything

1403
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
Except for that last

1404
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,871
So I'm never going to get a first down

1405
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
At University

1406
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
I need to be queer

1407
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:42,527
Yeah he's never been to the Getty

1408
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:51,231
Yeah save just had never even been they've just had a remote to go down there

1409
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
And make stuff up

1410
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
So I watched this lecture he doesn't need you he's already filled at all I wanted this lecture that he gave about

1411
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,007
From 2012

1412
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,847
It was from a convention

1413
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
I might have been carries I don't

1414
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
I'll say that we had a better audience

1415
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Vincent Austin

1416
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,319
The turnout was paid

1417
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
I learned

1418
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
From that

1419
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,951
The first level down when you go in

1420
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
Cuz you got to get past

1421
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,535
Security doors

1422
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
There's not even a versity according to his lecture in 2012

1423
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,703
It's the first level is full of Nazi remote viewers

1424
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,519
Were there to stop other remote viewers from get again

1425
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Quote

1426
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,639
They're not very good at it though he says if he laughed to himself

1427
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
And the audience

1428
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
They're not very good

1429
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
Maybe so f****** uncomfortable

1430
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,415
But there's not the remote first level

1431
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,487
Now hold on the second level

1432
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,375
Don't understand the second level is covered in gold

1433
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
There

1434
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,031
Linear unimaginable depravity goes on it

1435
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,431
It's just like it's like bacchanalia is today allowed

1436
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
That's unfair

1437
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Even

1438
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:26,719
Even not the remote viewers deserve laborer very employee you should be allowed to enjoy the bucket

1439
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,023
Go to the f****** gold bar

1440
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:37,471
After this point is it real murky

1441
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,663
3000 zero

1442
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
?

1443
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
Clear elevators

1444
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
Which I find

1445
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,623
Dubious

1446
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
There's a quote from the gross domestic product of the country goes into building these condos

1447
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
Hi that's like what what

1448
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Condo

1449
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:14,335
Seems like literally everything else that's done would be

1450
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Impossible

1451
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:20,991
Well it's weird you think that Medicare Social Security Medicaid makeup

1452
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,783
Two-thirds of the

1453
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,319
National

1454
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,415
It underground chamber condos

1455
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
So Below the living areas are a bunch of

1456
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Train

1457
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:36,095
Let go to the Air Force Base research centers

1458
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:50,175
My favorite part is always the weird

1459
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
Very specific

1460
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,367
Weird detailed destinations

1461
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,559
And it's crazy

1462
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,351
Crazy lecture

1463
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
It's actually kind of worth it

1464
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
If you've ever done stand-up

1465
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,495
It's kind of fun to watch because you get to watch a guy who's like

1466
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
On his homepage

1467
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
He's in like a f******

1468
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,335
UFO Magic

1469
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
Convention or whatever

1470
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,687
Still Bob Bob so hard

1471
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
View of the audience

1472
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,271
Believe him about the 15-20 minute mark

1473
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,575
You can just see the energy

1474
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:33,951
Sucked out of the room entirely walking around

1475
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
No

1476
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,255
I got a really impressive

1477
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,303
People he's supposed to talk about the Getty

1478
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
He's only talks about it for maybe like 10 minutes of his

1479
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
35-40 minute lecture

1480
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,703
Most of it's just rambling about how

1481
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Things could be better

1482
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,823
Did he give

1483
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
About the gap

1484
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
He's been there

1485
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
He says that he has

1486
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,319
Bi-Rite

1487
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
Of the place

1488
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
But they can't

1489
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
Sherwin

1490
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
Because they're copywriter

1491
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
But he has the

1492
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
What

1493
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,863
Beans videos pictures of the art maybe weakest of Teas

1494
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,215
Sir well they're getting checked your week.

1495
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
The Getty museum is full of Art

1496
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,127
What does beer make sense

1497
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,967
In front of us

1498
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,527
Painting

1499
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
It's hot

1500
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,855
Plays in the room

1501
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
And then

1502
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Control copyright

1503
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
I thought it was

1504
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
I thought it was Disney but apparently that's not

1505
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
Who that's that's enough

1506
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
Other piece

1507
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:55,103
The physical evidence has no other physical evidence

1508
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,151
He pulled out of his pocket

1509
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
A parking ticket

1510
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,223
Fat cells

1511
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,807
Some point in 2000

1512
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,575
Something

1513
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,135
How do you claiming is from before

1514
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,183
The museum is open

1515
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
Like during the day

1516
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,047
And that it says emm at means employed

1517
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,351
I don't know the DM means employee

1518
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,399
I don't know what that I don't give a s***

1519
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,239
He also says that it's from 10:30 and that's before the museum open

1520
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
Cuz he says it opens at 11

1521
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:28,127
According to the internet museum opens at 10 a.m.

1522
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,967
So I don't know what that means either

1523
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,855
Like I get reelected

1524
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Task

1525
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Paper

1526
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
And years old

1527
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
I don't know it doesn't

1528
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
Anyway

1529
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,167
What it proves is he's a weird dude for carrying that around

1530
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
You don't need that

1531
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,007
No I was I was

1532
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
I was on board with everything else but up until this point

1533
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
So

1534
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:03,967
You said this lady which that we've discovered right from other materials

1535
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,503
Was the remote viewer down there

1536
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039
Her name is Jeff

1537
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,087
The Hogwarts

1538
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
Her

1539
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,207
Shut off all sorts of alarm

1540
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:18,559
Executor has wrote the greatest fanfiction I've ever heard which is

1541
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
Hogwarts Nazis

1542
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
He's got Siri

1543
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,471
They feared for their lives

1544
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:33,151
What happened instead of trying to kill us they actually this is when they actually tried to recruit us

1545
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,991
By this time obviously they realize that Jim was

1546
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,551
Was dealing with some people on the outside that were

1547
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Trouble

1548
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879

1549
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:49,279
People right now and he said no

1550
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:53,887
You want me on your team this is my team these people are my people and if you want me

1551
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679
Why people come with me

1552
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
Are you following me so far

1553
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,799
I'm not sure isn't Jim just being brief

1554
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
This is a little bit after all that breathing

1555
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,967
You saying is that the cavers

01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
A talented account

1559
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:24,095
So he's because he also his dad was a Mason and got the keys to the kingdom which was a bicycle

1560
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,399
Magic

01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,239
Oh yeah that's

1562
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567

1564
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151

1568
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
You take them

01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,599
And they're like a controlling the Illuminati

1570
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,207
Bargaining power do you think you have an account

1571
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999

Kills your friend you're in

1581
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,063
That was still so they said fine so then they went and went into a recruitment

1582
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,415
My brother was me

1583
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,463
I'm trying to figure out who it was

1584
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,255
I'm supplying with all this information

1585
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,327
Anything

1586
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:32,447
Psychic testing in stores

1587
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,519
They had something going on

1588
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,591
And the first thing they do is they offer a military rank

1589
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:45,247
Are they taking you a rank of State like a major or something like that Air Force Air Force Major that gives out of

1590
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,831
They do that so that they've got you

1591
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
Contractually

1592
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,719
Secrets Leavenworth after that

1593
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,327
It was sometime after that they found out that it was actually me we were having dinner

1594
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:05,727
When the guy First Financial guy forget he realized it was actually I was alone there looking for it

1595
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:11,103
Told my brother he was a pale Shadow with me which is something he'll never forgive me for

1596
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
So

1597
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
Okay this is

1598
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:20,063
Alright also told me

1599
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
That I would be the one

1600
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
To destroy them

1601
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,231
And at this would be through

1602
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
And he told me that I was also in a very militaristic mood I was in the gun business I was

1603
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,263
Best weapon development

1604
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:45,663
And training and I actually was going to say I had a militia but let's just say I had a lot of young guys under

1605
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,687
Uber

1606
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,247
Of that nature

1607
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,063
Sounds like you got a militia it was an orgy

1608
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
He's got a lot of

1609
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,439
Young guys coming

1610
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
That is

1611
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
F******

1612
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Scariest

1613
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
Shitzo

1614
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
So

1615
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,119
There's a lot to unpack their psychological

1616
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,399
Perhaps too much

1617
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
There is

1618
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
1

1619
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
That dude

1620
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,287
Is so jealous of his brother

1621
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,567
Raising

1622
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:18,176
That's another one of those weird things they always throw in that weird like there's always the weird

1623
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:18,944
Detailed lights

1624
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,040
Oh and it goes to the f****** island of Catalina

1625
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,064
Also

1626
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,344
My brother isn't a psycho

1627
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,744
Because me so I don't know why my parents love him more than they do meet and now I'm trying to plug in love you guys

1628
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560
Look at me I've been stealing gun

1629
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Psychic

1630
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,984
Powers all over the place

1631
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,592
Underground cavers who control the Illuminati

1632
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,640
Tire world

1633
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
Are still

1634
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
Offering

1635
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,248
Military rank

1636
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,808
In order to avoid

1637
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,112
Throwing you in Leavenworth Prison

1638
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
Seems like it'd be very easy to

1639
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
Disappear you

1640
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,744
Like it wouldn't really are in a case

1641
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
Yeah there's another grasscity it doesn't matter

1642
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:16,544
No one has ever seen before and that they

1643
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
I can never go back to

1644
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,360
But we're going to put a

1645
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:25,760
There is definitely an in for a penny in for a pound

1646
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,064
Reptiles

1647
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,880
Area 51

1648
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:37,280
But I've heard never come out

1649
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:41,376
Actually they said they have an underground tunnel to Leavenworth

1650
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,472
Says 12 Leavenworth 12 Catalina

1651
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:50,080
Felicity

1652
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,640
I thought we were going to attack

1653
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
A dog whining

1654
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,600
It's a little annoying.

1655
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,072
Read episode of Lassie

1656
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:15,168
I would I would I would like to unpack that more but at the same time I realized

1657
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
What

1658
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,264
Project Camelot his shity production value

1659
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
We got them

1660
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,664
So I'm in the next clip we get to

1661
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,944
Blowing hard

1662
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
And revealing a very Alex Jones

1663
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,296
Mentality

1664
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
About him

1665
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Self

1666
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,856
Remember in the

1667
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,184
All the times Alex Jones

1668
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
I could have been one of them

1669
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,584
All the time

1670
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
Steven body that

1671
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
I'd given up this whole

1672
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
Elitist

1673
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
Underground

1674
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,240
Masonic

1675
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,776
Gods on Earth

1676
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,384
Should have tried to save the people on the surface because

1677
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,200
Obviously we don't deserve to be treated like

1678
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
Expendable cattle

1679
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,784
You're right what they think of us

1680
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
So I give it all up for that for everybody else but there is now we're actually winning because as I've said so

1681
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,512
If we actually can

1682
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,304
Occupied

1683
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,608
Open up Pandora's Box

1684
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,472
I don't even have to tell you what's down there because once that box gets open

1685
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,776
We will have Paradise on Earth

1686
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
Paradise will have free energy

1687
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
No pollution

1688
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
Green food

1689
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
No more Chemtrails vaccine

1690
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,272
You name it

1691
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
So all of that

1692
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
Is very much like Alex

1693
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
Especially the last part

1694
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
You name it

1695
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,952
Yep which is one of Alex's verb

1696
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,536
That leads me to believe that it's possible that Steve even listen

1697
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Infowars

1698
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:55,264
Hey Hazel

1699
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
You can

1700
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:14,208
Vaccines very much in line with the Infowars mentality

1701
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,488
What technology

1702
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,024
Supported it down there

1703
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
Are you proves that in no way

1704
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:21,120
Like Nikola Tesla or Elon Musk

1705
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
Nicola

1706
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Nikola Tesla

1707
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,776
Cuz I don't think anybody really has Tesla

1708
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,848
Give you serious

1709
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,480
What am I

1710
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,064
I feel like you're

1711
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
Perhaps the least of the issues you should have

1712
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
Alright

1713
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,144
I told you earlier

1714
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
Shocking similarities

1715
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
Infowars

1716
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,984
Alex Jones

1717
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
She hates

1718
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
Infowars people

1719
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,128
Like the actual people

1720
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:08,480
In-N-Out Store in these idiots out

1721
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
Tucson

1722
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,808
Trying to make everybody think that

1723
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
Human trafficking is something to happen

1724
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,440
Walking across the sand of the desert

1725
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,584
It turns out that the internet

1726
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,632
Conspiracy Community is turned on

1727
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,728
Now pretty 100% behind the idea that that is a

1728
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
Diversion

1729
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,800
From real child traffic

1730
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Picking which I guess

1731
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
I'm not entirely sure

1732
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:41,760
That because it came up in his bio

1733
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,296
He has work

1734
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,088
Deck protection

1735
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
Detail

1736
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
For like

1737
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,648
Hillary Clinton

1738
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
And so now he is

1739
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,424
Sure you are persona non grata

1740
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
I don't know

1741
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,776
I don't know how to feel about that

1742
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
It's one of those things that I take

1743
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
I take no pleasure in the

1744
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
The wrap

1745
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Eating each other

1746
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,200
Because the ones that survive are tougher

1747
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:19,136
When to con artists go up against each other and one prevails

1748
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,440
They get a boosted.

1749
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
Credibility

1750
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,744
For having vanquished

1751
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
The conman

1752
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,096
Amore reinforced conman

1753
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
I don't know I I wish they'd all shut up

1754
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,264
That's not an option it's the Highlanders

1755
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,568
Subway

1756
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
Kill another con man power

1757
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,712
Yeah there can be only one who experiences the

1758
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
And then

1759
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
I don't remember the app

1760
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,600
Actual end of that show or movie

1761
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,232
I do

1762
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,608
Just reflecting on my

1763
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
No

1764
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,448
Like he's from Egypt

1765
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,728
Buddy has a Scottish a

1766
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
That doesn't make

1767
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,312
And why is the music

1768
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,128
The Highlander is

1769
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,944
I got it

1770
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
Supposed to be from each

1771
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
He's supposed to be for me to dude look it up it's bananas

1772
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
That'll be our next step

1773
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
Episode but for now

1774
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,696
We get a very rare

1775
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
Saint project

1776
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,560
Adam

1777
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,328
Death

1778
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
Kerry Cassidy

1779
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,656
Getting into a disagreement

1780
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
I'm just going to say that

1781
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:42,592
Alien base it's not an alien base is definitely a human-made base Highway

1782
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
Whatever

1783
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
However

1784
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
When you consider

1785
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,232
Human

1786
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,768
All right this is what's important

1787
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Aspect to all of this stuff

1788
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,544
That and people ride this is where people get confused because I deserve you earlier today

1789
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,592
Deal with the aliens and the

1790
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,664
All right here's the

1791
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,736
Hear it conspiracy theorist in Cars Getting Coffee

1792
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,720
What I want to hear

1793
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,768
These

1794
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:39,168
Mark Richards.

1795
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
Or if they just let them

1796
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,544
Gaston like

1797
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,592
Tonight Show

1798
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
Valenwood crushed

1799
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,808
Cuz Fallon if Ellen is essentially the mainstream character

1800
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
That's really all it is

1801
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,904
He is there to smile and make you feel like you're the

1802
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
Rate is very low rent

1803
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:08,352
Exactly you can't hold a candle to Kerry Cassidy

1804
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
Carrie doesn't this

1805
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,936
She's I know she does

1806
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,520
She doesn't believe she's the one will

1807
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,568
You will admit that perhaps

1808
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,848
They are indeed

1809
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:22,944
I'll be goddamned if you say that they're not aliens

1810
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
No

1811
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
As this clip goes on

1812
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832
Familiar

1813
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,416
Blood libel

1814
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,768
I will get into it actually

1815
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,888
Jesus.

1816
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,936
Uses a really funny word

1817
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
Connection

1818
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Loose

1819
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Human

1820
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,640
Human

1821
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,944
Negative human emotional psychic energy

1822
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,552
Right right right

1823
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Human

1824
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,232
All right this is what's important

1825
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,536
Satanic

1826
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,584
Aspect to all of this stuff

1827
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,984
This is where people get confused because it's just that I didn't interview earlier today and it

1828
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,800
What's the deal with the aliens and the

1829
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
Demon

1830
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
All right here's the connection

1831
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
Loose

1832
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,272
Human

1833
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,208
What is the connection dead

1834
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,488
Ruben the alien

1835
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,256
Eva diva

1836
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
It's loose

1837
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,072
You're stupid

1838
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,864
Freezers not lose

1839
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:54,336
Negative human emotional psychic energy

1840
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:02,528
That's about what they talked about you know they're collecting his babies and they're stealing Schumann

1841
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,832
Dollar Store

1842
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:11,232
And torturing them and drink their blood everything else will yeah yeah they do all that but there is something else

1843
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Statik selektah

1844
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,048
Which is not of this

1845
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:18,400
Level level that Ronnie check the oven higher level

1846
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
Course

1847
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
Product

1848
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,360
Speed collected from us by the higher-level entities these aliens if you will

1849
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
Lettuce nutrition

1850
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,552
Call the black goo

1851
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
Product

1852
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,096
Ashley product from E-40 density person into this

1853
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
Realm of the 4D where it is stored and collected

1854
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
This is the sort of thing people are having a hard time understanding obviously most people are not quite there they're trying to

1855
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,152
Extend through understanding things like adrenochrome

1856
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,968
They're certainly far from understanding louche

1857
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,016
Captain Stanley's

1858
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
Dude

1859
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,112
You know

1860
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,416
I love entertaining

1861
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,720
And Ed like trying to follow

1862
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:20,096
Follow the thread on that tunic stuff that was a man shooting words out of his mouth and it was

1863
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,888
Pathetic and he should be ashamed of

1864
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,704
You like to humor stuff to an extent that

1865
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,288
Wildly frustrating for me because it's like

1866
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
I like it it's a point

1867
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:37,760
You got a dog

1868
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,576
But this is too far

1869
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:44,928
Search Pro

1870
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,952
That was bad

1871
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:52,352
He was clearly scrambling across tonight

1872
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
Because that's something they don't

1873
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Apparently

1874
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,264
The caver world

1875
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:05,408
But so what do you know about

1876
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,760
I don't know what to do lyrics

1877
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
It comes from a novel

1878
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,904
Book

1879
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
Robert Monroe

1880
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,952
Call Zafar Journey

1881
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,328
Lived on and is retained as an idea of negative

1882
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Human emotion

1883
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,144
Same thing Alex talks about like a

1884
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
Psychic vampirism

1885
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
Stuff like that

1886
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:36,640
Got it

1887
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:41,760
Little do they know they can just make people laugh

1888
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,160
Be fair this guy is

1889
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
Creating a Lotto app

1890
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
Suomi we've gone over the adrenochrome stuff

1891
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,840
Before

1892
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,192
I'm bored I'm bored

1893
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,824
Now I'm excited about Lucia

1894
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
Can't fourth dimension

1895
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,968
What is it

1896
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,368
Because I know exactly where that is

1897
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
But

1898
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,440
It's

1899
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Because

1900
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:28,864
Non-falsifiable not verifiable stuff it's like there's red

1901
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
Does a transmitter between our world in

1902
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:35,776
Negative stuff and bring it over there they stockpile in

1903
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,384
All right man I watched

1904
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,480
We will move on

1905
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Cuz we'll get back of the dance

1906
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,832
Here in a bit

1907
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,648
Where is the third but we'll get back to it here in a second

1908
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,928
Cuz we got to talk about.

1909
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
But it is also

1910
01:34:56,512 --> 01:35:00,096
Associated with what we would called demons

1911
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,656
And this goes back to Lilith

1912
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
Which is essentially what we would refer to as the mother of demons who was according to

1913
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,640
History is Adam's first wife

1914
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,296
Now believe it or not people think they attributed all sorts of activity on Earth to Lucifer while it's not really Lucifer

1915
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,832
Actually real

1916
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,880
The real quick right

1917
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,672
Everybody knows that

1918
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,464
The reason that Lilith is

1919
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
See No Evil

1920
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,072
Because she has control over her own sexual

1921
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
She was nuts

1922
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,168
Serviam to Adam

1923
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,960
Alita in the Apocrypha

1924
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
Track

1925
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
That guy would be like

1926
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
She's actually the devil

1927
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,360
Because she would not be

1928
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,432
Women

1929
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,968
Cow

1930
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,992
What's

1931
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
To do

1932
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,088
Do what they do without

1933
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,160
Or don't do what I tell them to do

1934
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
It's like

1935
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
What could that be

1936
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
Super Bowl

1937
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,328
Spoiler alert I didn't get a look at him

1938
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,888
Donna wormhole

1939
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,424

1940
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,008

Winning local

1944
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,016
Getting to be on the side stage

1945
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:30,464
1897 Loop

1946
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,768
Lauren Hoffman

1953
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,224
Before they were big

1954
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,760
It also

1955
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,784
Little trivia

1956
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,832
Little rules

Then Sarah McLachlan

01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,120
Wait on the Lilith Fair tour

1963
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:13,472
Royal

1964
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,264
Jim the CPA

1965
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
Incorrect

1966
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
I did not know that

1967
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,456
The cigarette

1968
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,952
Ever

1969
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
She was on the seven

1970
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
Floor

1971
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:40,864
Brutal song

1972
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:50,848
When you talk about these underground bases this the thing that I really want to get to it

1973
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,896
When we go down under the Getty

1974
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,664
You don't

1975
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
There's a point where we stopped

1976
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Okay

1977
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
There we don't go any farther

1978
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,320
It's called the bottom

1979
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:04,416
Mmm maybe the day will come when we can go farther but we're not

1980
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,720
I don't know anybody has gone past this point

1981
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
Yes

1982
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,792
And this is were really awful point

1983
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,328
This is the point where

1984
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
You're gonna really nasty s***

1985
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Yeah

1986
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:24,384
So I don't know what the hell is down there but we talked about aliens yes that's probably where they are they're probably down there below that level

1987
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,176
We don't really

1988
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,760
Stewartville cavers aren't

1989
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
Aliens

1990
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
Turn clear

1991
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
Demon

1992
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,672
What do you say Naruto

1993
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,720
Just cuz we got a parts it out a little bit

1994
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:42,560
Is I can't bring myself to imagine the next level

1995
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:47,168
Right I know that I would have to say some rude

1996
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:50,752
What's a really f***** up specifics and I really want to do that

1997
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,800
Tina this is where you call it Alex

1998
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
Cuz Alex

1999
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:59,456
Can come up with your your horrible f****** nightmare scenario your own Alex

2000
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,784
Jim was a great

2001
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,576
EPA though

2002
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,136
Is true

2003
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Come by

2004
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,976
You just don't see that kind of talent

2005
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
So in terms of

2006
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:21,216
You do a lot of this by remote viewing if you want to call it. But you disperse going there in person

2007
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,800
Did you go there exactly one or did you go there more than one

2008
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:30,432
Do you say go there are you talking about going underground and just visiting the ark

2009
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:39,392
Underground

2010
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
One time

2011
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:47,072
Am I mistake or if my brother went on a tour with

2012
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,216
Who does not have the same psychic powers that I do

2013
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:59,360
The pale Shadow but I just got to let you know my brother

2014
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,152
Went on a tour

2015
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,248
I don't I don't know

2016
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,064
Just to reinforce

2017
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:13,440
Closest we will get to a full-on Kerry Cassidy

2018
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:20,608
No later later okay there we go

2019
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:25,472
Sony remote if you want to call that is such a like

2020
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,264
Ascension flight like

2021
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,544
You don't know what I

2022
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,944
You know what you're not doing what I know of other people

2023
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,992
Harry doesn't quite trust remote viewers

2024
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,296
Cuz she's kind of being shity

2025
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,344
Mmm episode with Courtney Brown

2026
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
That we did

2027
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:48,512
She was like she

2028
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:51,328
He doesn't think that everybody who remote views

2029
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,608
Is telling the truth

2030
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
Or knows what they're doing

2031
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:58,752
It's a strange

2032
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,848
You don't even have physical fake proof

2033
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,896
Right right

2034
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,968
You might just be making this up

2035
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:14,368
You didn't even bother to take a photo of your TV and redo it

2036
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,904
But he's in with Billy

2037
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:20,000
Billy's room anyway

2038
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,072
Vivi's cavers

2039
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,864
They've been planning

2040
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
Forever baby thousands

2041
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,936
Alder plant

2042
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
And they know

2043
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,544
The day will come that they might get sound out

2044
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,592
Ameriplan

2045
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
This makes me believe

2046
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
Steve story wailer

2047
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
You see that's the thing

2048
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,832
They've been planning for this

2049
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,880
For hundreds of years

2050
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,160
Obviously this

2051
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,952
What we're dealing with this a

2052
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,792
Conspiracy but the people that we're dealing with here

2053
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:59,936
I've been working on this for thousands of years is Audi

2054
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,520
Are also equally equally ancient

2055
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:06,080
And they've been planning for first

2056
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,360
She stayed one day

2057
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
When the day comes that we rise up

2058
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,064
And confront them that they will destroy everything and try to destroy destroy the bunker but destroy the end

2059
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Interesting

2060
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,392
Shiplap

2061
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
Which

2062
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
First off

2063
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
Which day was

2064
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,144
We talked and thousands years ago

2065
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,960
Like biblical like

2066
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
8000

2067
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
What are we talking about

2068
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,080
Bigbang

2069
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:44,992
Are we talking about when they were created or when they evolved to let you work this out

2070
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,368
And if your plan

2071
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,648
Includes

2072
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,232
We're building this thing to f****** chill and have a good time

2073
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:59,072
But we at the same time as no covered Spa

2074
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:05,472
Eventually the day will come when they will come knocking on our door

2075
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,056
If you can see that far in the future you see a future where you don't

2076
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:09,824
Have them

2077
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848
Knock on your door

2078
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,384
Baby don't even f******

2079
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,456
Because I watched

2080
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
His lecture about

2081
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,272
I have a little bit more

2082
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,296
Okay

2083
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,832
Here's a quote

2084
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
About this

2085
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,952
There's a book written about 100 years ago

2086
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,488
Very very controversial

2087
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:31,328
Throw you in jail Just For Men

2088
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,424
Call it book at book there's a chapter with a lion

2089
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,216
He says quote

2090
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:39,264
What beer do we have of the blank

2091
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,544
None

2092
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,104
If we have an awesome weapon the underground

2093
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,128
The Metropolitan

2094
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,200
He goes on to four leaf clover

2095
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,992
Goes on to quote a passage

2096
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
This passage

2097
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,832
Protocols of the Elders of the

2098
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:57,952
No

2099
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,256
Yes

2100
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,304
OU the big one

2101
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
What is a

2102
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,496
Always

2103
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,848
So this is the product this is protocol number 9

2104
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,408
He's working office

2105
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:23,040
And what he says blank he's just as he doesn't want to in the room say

2106
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:27,904
Goya cuz that's the word clearly black

2107
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,184
Clear

2108
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,976
He's talking about in the lecture

2109
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,048
But the

2110
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,608
You may say that the gullible rise upon us

2111
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Arms and hands

2112
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,936
If they guess what is going on before the time comes

2113
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,216
But in the west we have a

2114
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,240
Dance this maneuver

2115
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,032
Terror

2116
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,080
There's a very stoutest Hearts quail

2117
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,616
The underground Metropolitan

2118
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,408
Those Subterranean quarters

2119
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,432
Before the time comes

2120
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:54,016
Will be driven under all the capitals in from whence those capitals

2121
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,552
We'll be blown into the air with their organs

2122
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,648
The fact that he says the underground Metropolitan

2123
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,440
He references at the end

2124
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:06,304
The organizations in archives I can

2125
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,608
It's a little bit later in the

2126
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
That's a bummer.

2127
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,008
A little bit later in the lecture he says this

2128
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:19,616
Messages from the protocols of the Elders of Zion there I said it

2129
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,896
I'm not an anti-semite

2130
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:24,736
I have a lot of Jewish French this book was written over 100 years ago

2131
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
Totally accurate

2132
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Sorry for going

2133
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:33,184
Yeah wow he believes

2134
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:36,000
Without any proof a

2135
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:39,584
I do PS4 remote viewing and passenger

2136
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,472
Just from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2137
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
Trans-fast

2138
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,544
It's great it's great

2139
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,944
Is f****** crazy just a super-rich to do like I need a bigger space

2140
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
The kidnapper

2141
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:05,952
Movie with Kevin Spacey Kevin Spacey

2142
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,512
Yikes

2143
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:11,840
Now that's what the Jews are planning could be

2144
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
But

2145
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Be

2146
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
Protocol

2147
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:18,752
What's weird about Pez is that people don't know is that it's all about taken down

2148
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Spacey

2149
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,312
That's what it's always been about

2150
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:26,176
Spacey 4th Dimension

2151
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,088
So the idea is that one

2152
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,880
Humanity finds out

2153
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,160
Right then

2154
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
They will blow it up

2155
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,256
And then it'll kill all the people

2156
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,304
Along with the people down there

2157
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,096
If I had thousands of years

2158
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:50,496
And magical abilities

2159
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,592
Brake controller

2160
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,128
I don't know any of these things

2161
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Magic

2162
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,688
You can just use Magic

2163
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:03,040
Really the thing about magic is your imagination

2164
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,856
And the people who talk the most about him

2165
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,880
Magic

2166
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,160
And it being real

2167
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,720
Sub-Zero imagination when it comes to

2168
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,840
You don't need to blow anything up

2169
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,864
Just release gas

2170
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
Or something

2171
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:23,520
So anyway so much better being evil than evil people dance

2172
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Because the

2173
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,616
Like he's not evil

2174
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,408
He's a manipulative liar

2175
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,736
Like the evil people in this situation are made up

2176
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:39,392
He's imagining fake evil people that he's working again we can do better than the Shadows

2177
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,672
In his mind

2178
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:47,072
Because he's crazy and is a guy who ripped

2179
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
Hours of our brothers

2180
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:53,984
Ice cream shop go check it out

2181
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,056
Make the best ice cream this side of the Mississippi second location open

2182
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,336
But I'll tell you what

2183
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,616
Psychic powers

2184
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,896
Can't compare to your

2185
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:06,784
I don't think David I don't know if he'll ever forgive you percent

2186
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,672
I don't think as bility I think it's just a function of memory

2187
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,488
Anyway

2188
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,536
Yeah the ideas are going to blow it up

2189
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,096
But it right excuse

2190
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
Hear me out

2191
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,936
Cuz I feel like they own it

2192
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:27,264
You can't just blow up something in Los Angeles

2193
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,288
Without an excuse

2194
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,872
This is where Trump comes in

2195
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,432
Hold on

2196
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:38,784
This is a real-life drama right now

2197
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,576
Dion

2198
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,392
Donald Trump's meeting in Indonesia with

2199
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:51,584
And obviously they want 2nd nuclear episode but what's really going on behind the scenes

2200
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:57,728
The CIA was using Kim Jeong hoon and North Korea as the

2201
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Excuse

2202
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,544
Or a

2203
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,568
Scapegoat

2204
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:06,688
For when the time came to blow up the Getty they were going to blame it on North Korean

2205
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,968
North Korea submarine

2206
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,296
So Donald Trump is basically removing that

2207
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
And what's what else is happening right now is that not only is he making peace with North Korea so that they can't use that

2208
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
Excuses are you

2209
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,280
Right2know

2210
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,584
Precipitation of some sort of event

2211
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,376
Of course

2212
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:31,520
I'm getting through channels coming from coming down from the White House actually that

2213
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:38,432
They're actually talking about the Getty right now they're talkin about the nuclear trapdoor at the Getty so

2214
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:44,832
Right so I suspected the reason why we don't have the Marines crashing down the door and the reason why we don't have down

2215
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,136
Don't trip out there saying okay what's up with the Getty

2216
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:52,000
Is it they are aware of the nuclear bomb

2217
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
You know

2218
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,072
Uno

2219
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
You know

2220
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,888
The whole bag

2221
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:04,288
So his conception isn't there's a nuclear bomb

2222
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,824
If and when

2223
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:09,920
Hitt has Steve and his militia get together

2224
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:14,016
Storm the doors in order to

2225
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:18,880
I don't know get rid of all the evidence of satanic Temple's ground below this

2226
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:22,464
Work even that

2227
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,768
Work like in terms of like

2228
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
Do you know what

2229
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:31,424
Mutually assured

2230
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:33,728
Annihilate

2231
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,544
Yeah that's way better

2232
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:56,768
A bad plan mixture between like Watchmen a little bit

2233
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,048
Little bit of Lost

2234
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,984
I've only watched the first three episodes

2235
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
Nuclear

2236
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,360
Thermonuclear bomb

2237
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:15,456
So wrong course

2238
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
Which actually works

2239
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:17,760
This timeline lost

2240
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,856
He's coming up with his philosophies

2241
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,256
There's just so much b*******

2242
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,328
Crazy

2243
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:39,520
You know it's like a playhouse so many pundits

2244
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
Failed

2245
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:44,640
Comedians like they just don't have a sense of humor they don't

2246
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,176
They don't get anything

2247
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:48,736
As far as humor creative

2248
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:53,600
Showing up Indies like

2249
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,904
Racist b******* tirade

2250
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,976
That what they're doing is being like provocative or funny

2251
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,536
Like this

2252
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,816
Exceeded

2253
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:08,192
And then realized I probably hit my feelings

2254
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:11,776
I still like having fun but I was never

2255
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,568
I was never like

2256
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:15,616
A complete failure

2257
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:20,736
In some definition of assail

2258
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,528
But I

2259
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,832
I am a failed stand up

2260
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,856
As already

2261
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:29,696
Yorkie

2262
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:32,768
Good as I get to the world

2263
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:33,536
But I'm not

2264
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,072
To my own expectation

2265
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
Sins of my own experience

2266
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:38,656
Those people like Gavin McInnes

2267
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,192
Wright was a failure

2268
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,728
He was never funny

2269
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,752
On stage

2270
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,288
Dave Rubin

2271
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,152
Flowey song

2272
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,432
To stand up so there we go

2273
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,480
The only person who's even close to that world

2274
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,248
Who is

2275
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,784
Like genuinely

2276
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,576
Pretty funny as a stand-up is Rogan

2277
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:59,136
Right he's not even fully in that world

2278
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:04,256
YouTube he's descending quickly into a caver hell

2279
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:08,352
Needs to be much more critical of the

2280
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632
The people he allows on

2281
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
Oregon needs to

2282
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:15,776
To be better about calling about a couple episodes on recently

2283
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:19,872
There were.

2284
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:24,992
I don't need to tell someone what they should or shouldn't do with right there were good

2285
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,296
Sentences on each of those episodes where he was like

2286
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:32,416
I appreciate that if you want

2287
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,696
Have these people on

2288
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,000
Embarrass them God bless

2289
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,304
What do you want

2290
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,840
Not again if you like

2291
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,400
Showtimes

2292
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,032
These guys are like that except field

2293
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:49,568
Like

2294
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:53,152
It's even that far

2295
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,456
Fiction

2296
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:58,784
These guys are like people who tried to write fanfiction

2297
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,184
And failed it that no one can understand GoPayment not even trying to write fiction like trying to

2298
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,536
Write fanfiction about somebody else's stuff because they can't come up with their own ideas

2299
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:15,936
And they realize that they couldn't even come up with their own ideas based off of other people's ID

2300
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,728
Which is just like a random ass

2301
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:26,688
Yeah

2302
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:31,040
That gives us a break from Alex Jones everyday

2303
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,600
We get now to carry

2304
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,184
What about the notion that

2305
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:43,328
Donald Trump has been going around supposedly arresting at least some pedophile

2306
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,680
We've already talked about.

2307
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,960
Maybe doing

2308
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,496
Military trials

2309
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:53,568
Offshore in Navy vessel

2310
01:54:55,104 --> 01:55:00,480
And I'm hearing this

2311
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,784
So it's not just a rumor

2312
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
Kind of

2313
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:06,368
Jessica's mobile

2314
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,440
Not a river

2315
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,232
Multiple people

2316
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,512
Also

2317
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,840
Even if you had military tribunals

2318
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,632
Pretty Rae

2319
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:21,472
Like an international waters

2320
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:26,336
You still got to put them in prison Leavenworth

2321
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:29,408
They're still going to be a record of them somewhere it's not like you can just diss

2322
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,688
Hear them or kill them

2323
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:37,088
Can disappear people they said there's no due process you could be in acting

2324
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,624
Pedophile

2325
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,184
The boat give him a second trial and then kill them

2326
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,232
There's no did not look at death penalty

2327
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,304
We all feel like maybe there should be

2328
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,144
Did this argument doesn't work

2329
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:50,912
No

2330
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:53,216
It only works out it only works

2331
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
It's like

2332
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,032
You believe like

2333
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
Carrie

2334
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,336
Steve dude

2335
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,872
These people

2336
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,432
Which you've got to prove

2337
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:05,760
Confined with that

2338
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,552
You still got to prove it

2339
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:11,136
It's not like the burden of proof is any less in the water

2340
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:21,632
If it's an international waters and probably even more severe cuz now you're under like un

2341
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Egypt

2342
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:25,984
You know you're under the Osprey just withdrew from the UN Human Rights

2343
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:29,312
Cancel we can eat whomever we want wherever we want

2344
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,592
Amazon that

2345
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:34,688
Great job guys

2346
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,480
Everleigh

2347
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:43,648
Expressed her opinion on the old

2348
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,696
Is it for him

2349
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,232
Tri-form XO

2350
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:57,216
When she says and their fingers world

2351
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:01,056
When she says In that clip what about this

2352
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
To bring that up

2353
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:05,152
Right she's not waiting for an answer

2354
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:07,712
She's bringing it up and then launches into another thing

2355
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:09,760
She's in favor

2356
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:13,600
Because of the overlap between

2357
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,392
Stolen Valor

2358
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:19,488
In the intelligence Community yeah yeah mixed with

2359
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,536
Secret space program bulshit

2360
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,072
Heavy overlap

2361
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:27,936
In the two about light

2362
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,472
About

2363
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,496
She's being lied to

2364
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,544
Robert David

2365
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,592
Steel it has been on her show

2366
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:40,480
I bet he's the one if you don't remember he talked about the children

2367
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:42,784
He's been on Project Camelot

2368
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
Told her about

2369
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
Working towards

2370
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:52,256
So whatever behind as there are exist

2371
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
In both worlds

2372
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,816
Course and I don't know if they're all the

2373
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:55,840
People but

2374
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
This Probably sounds

2375
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
So

2376
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
Boy I tell you what

2377
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:03,264
Boy I tell you

2378
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,080
Earlier that

2379
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,360
Before the night

2380
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,432
Before the cock crowed three times

2381
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:12,736
Before Paul denies our Lord

2382
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,624
Makes a Bigfoot

2383
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,184
And that is Terry

2384
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,208
Brings up Mark Richards

2385
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,488
No

2386
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:26,048
It seems like they do the murderer

2387
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,328
Jesse's not impressed

2388
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:34,752
I guess you might know about my interviews with Captain Mark Richards program

2389
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,568
Time

2390
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,616
And I go out to

2391
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:42,688
Add to interview women prison

2392
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:46,784
And he's talking about these you know

2393
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,552
They are

2394
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,344
Going to try to arrest

2395
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,928
Usher

2396
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,512
And so on but they're never going to get that. The highest level

2397
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:59,840
I know what I have to say about that

2398
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:06,240
And there's at you know there's Draco involved as well because this is a big war

2399
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:09,312
Not just into one level

2400
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:15,200
I want to play that 300

2401
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:21,856
Draco bout to compile of it I got perfect I noticed that but I f******

2402
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,392
Tim forgot it

2403
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:30,816
Go fuc yourself

2404
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:41,568
You wonder what I have to say about that yes and there is a Graco involved

2405
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:47,968
As well because this is a big war

2406
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,992
Another level

2407
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:55,392
And yeah and I know but let me finish just so I can paint the picture a little bit more

2408
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,416
Sylveon

2409
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,936
And rescuing day did rescue a number of the object keys

2410
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:13,056
What they said happened was the next night they were abducted Again by the gray

2411
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:19,456
They could be lying s*** but you know I know

2412
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,064
So you know how do you look at this

2413
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,856
You know you're at your spot

2414
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:32,256
Most people are not even close to being to this level let alone physics

2415
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,328
Yes it's

2416
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:39,424
Petition to get the military to

2417
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,192
To storm

2418
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,544
And Terry takes issue with the idea of like why do you have a petition

2419
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,312
What's that going to do

2420
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:49,664
In the background argument

2421
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:51,456
Yeah but hold on

2422
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,760
We're going to talk more about that

2423
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,600
The petition is a finger

2424
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,392
Waiting at the latch

2425
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,672
On Pandora's Box

2426
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:07,840
How far is the secret space program and in all this is concerning

2427
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,400
Its relationship to what's going on but Underground

2428
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:13,216
It's the same people

2429
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:19,616
Okay it's the Third Reich the Third Reich is very much involved we have the we have everything is going on in agar

2430
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:25,504
Catherine all that people people don't have any clue as to that we can't begin to talk about that because most people listen

2431
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,528
Way over their head

2432
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:28,320
Oh s*** you said

2433
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,856
Chinese bus

2434
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:34,976
Oh no.

2435
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,280
Right which is not

2436
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,816
Right but I mean

2437
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:39,840
Haven't we

2438
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:44,960
Can't we get past that are we at the fourth-ranked at least now the problem is.

2439
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Fail

2440
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:47,520
Who problem is agartha

2441
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,384
In a number of contacts.

2442
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,920
Word to mean number

2443
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:57,248
Generally it could be used as a

2444
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,552
Feeling term for like the Garden of Eden

2445
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,600
In some weird internet can

2446
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
Conspiracy world

2447
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
Did not know that

2448
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:08,000
But something along the lines of like a mythical city like El Dorado

2449
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:11,840
In the same

2450
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,632
And somewhere else

2451
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:18,240
Because he's mentioned the Third Reich

2452
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:20,544
I unfortunately know that 100%

2453
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
He believes

2454
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,592
Hollow Earth theory

2455
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,128
Because that

2456
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:26,432
Is very specifically

2457
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,968
I believe

2458
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:37,184
They come from all of these balls in the air how do you have the time to believe in

2459
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,208
All of this

2460
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:42,816
Can't you also just believe that likes integrated a lot of

2461
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,656
There's a 5-hour video you guys can watch online if you want to about the

2462
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,728
I watched it because I

2463
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:50,752
Used to work at Groupon

2464
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:04,064
Wait did you just watch

2465
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,928
Not even that

2466
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:10,464
That's literally the first soundtrack

2467
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:21,984
Not vaguely once I don't know which one

2468
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:22,752
But it's there

2469
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:26,080
So we believe in this

2470
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,384
Way back in the day Atlanta

2471
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,152
Stephen Libera

2472
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,968
Existed highly technological

2473
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,760
Wonderful

2474
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:36,832
The story it could be that the two got into a war

2475
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,856
They started experimenting

2476
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:41,184
And they blew themselves up

2477
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,488
That is the plot to Disney's

2478
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:50,656
Right it's also a lot of the mythology that comes down from like Casey's on the

2479
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:51,680
Theosophist

2480
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,776
I'm not going to lie to you

2481
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,568
Love The Frighteners

2482
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,616
Huge fan of Back to the Future

2483
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,640
But

2484
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,408
Man

2485
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,688
Michael j.fox

2486
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,992
Atlantis was incredible

2487
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,040
I mean time is shown

2488
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,832
Back to the Future

2489
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,464
Not going to get that argument now

2490
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:16,000
So as the theory goes that

2491
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,024
Survivors of Atlanta

2492
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,304
Just being highly evolved

2493
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,840
Slide to the interior of the Earth

2494
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,632
Quarantine order to

2495
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,400
Guest help

2496
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:26,240
Humanity continue to evolve

2497
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,568
The remainders of it

2498
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
Just the people

2499
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:32,384
The highly evolved

2500
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,808
We have either like

2501
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:40,832
Generally

2502
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,136
Are very

2503
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:44,416
Weird

2504
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
440 warring faction

2505
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,000
I don't

2506
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:48,768
Want to come

2507
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:51,840
Continue once you start saying they split

2508
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,376
Why what

2509
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:54,912
Fine

2510
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:55,936
Continue

2511
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,496
I'm going to bring this backed out

2512
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:02,080
Warring faction

2513
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,128
The Shambhala and agartha

2514
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,152
Which are the rec

2515
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,176
Maybe two groups

2516
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:12,832
That's true that like one of them's the Templars and one is Mason another picture

2517
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
Do schools

2518
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,696
Better faking to be at war with each other throughout the Universe.

2519
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,976
Sure why not

2520
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:22,304
Search through through there.

2521
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,632
Target

2522
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,960
Doesn't seem hard they're rooted in the same group but used

2523
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:29,984
Appearance of

2524
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,056
Kind of exactly what Alex

2525
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:33,824
Globo's

2526
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,128
Who was on the side of an ox

2527
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,968
He was referring to

2528
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,552
According to this entire mythology there is like

2529
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:46,624
Realize is a lot of this comes down

2530
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,672
From people who have channeled alien

2531
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:51,744
And stuff like that a lot of it comes down from like

2532
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,768
Very discredit

2533
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,536
Scholars

2534
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:56,352
In the same way that Alex misrepresents

2535
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,376
Primary sources

2536
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,400
They do some

2537
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,424
Some of the same

2538
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,192
But

2539
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,984
There's no solid evidence

2540
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
Sometimes both

2541
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
Admire

2542
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:08,128
Your

2543
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:08,896
Knowledge

2544
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,920
Vista

2545
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:20,160
I'm literally

2546
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:22,976
At a place now where I am

2547
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,536
Astonished by how much you know about this

2548
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:33,472
God damn it you don't need to know this stuff life goes on no need to know about

2549
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:36,800
So there's no evidence of this at all

2550
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,336
In terms of real thing

2551
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,152
Proponent behind

2552
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,456
Humane talking

2553
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,504
Pinheads

2554
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,344
Is Erich von daniken

2555
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:51,648
He is er always Bond

2556
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:54,720
Guy

2557
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,512
I love this

2558
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,560
Was Carl Sagan quote about Erik von detten

2559
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:02,912
Book is called Chariots of

2560
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:03,680
Of the Gods

2561
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,472
A lot of it is mistranslation

2562
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,496
Like Sumerian

2563
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:09,568
He had no knowledge of

2564
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
You making giant Tucson

2565
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,688
Experts in Sumerian

2566
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,456
Can

2567
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,224
Translated

2568
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,248
Perfectly right

2569
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,576
I don't know it

2570
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,416
Perhaps

2571
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:25,696
But Carl taken

2572
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,464
To say about his

2573
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:30,816
That rating is careless is Von daniken

2574
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:34,656
Sisters were dummy

2575
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:36,960
Should be should be so popular

2576
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,008
The silver commentary on the credulous method

2577
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,032
Despair of our time

2578
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,312
I also hope

2579
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,360
Continuing popularity of books like

2580
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,896
Chariots of the Gods in high school

2581
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,664
In college

2582
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
Logic courses

2583
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
His object lessons in

2584
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:48,736
Sloppy think

2585
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,784
I know no recent books

2586
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,856
So riddled with logical and factual errors as the works of Eric

2587
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,208
It passed Works Von daniken has referred to the

2588
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,232
Quote book of

2589
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,536
Dzyan

2590
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,560
Which does not exist

2591
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:12,288
That seems like a big sticking point is referenced

2592
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:18,688
It's a figment of Helena blavatsky

2593
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,712
He's imagination

2594
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:22,528
And only exist in quote her astral Realm

2595
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:27,648
Round of how the Necronomicon of the Mad Arab Abdul alhazred only existed

2596
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:30,720
Lovecraft's fiction for L Ron Hubbard's Excalibur

2597
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
Real

2598
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,328
As a piece of evidence

2599
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:38,912
In a lot of his work

2600
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:43,520
Just because

2601
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,288
He is

2602
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,056
Fairies

2603
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:46,848
Central to this

2604
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,128
World this

2605
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:54,272
Is Ancient Aliens specifically V the hollow Earth version of

2606
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,296
You need to really

2607
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,136
Like

2608
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
Equally like

2609
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,440
Discreditable

2610
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:04,512
Is really like almost

2611
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:05,792
0 is like

2612
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:08,096
He's at that Pappy of the mall

2613
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:11,936
So I want I took a little bit of time to look at it

2614
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,800
Is the dispensary event

2615
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,336
Yeah perhaps I don't

2616
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:20,640
I don't know like that's the thing about him

2617
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:23,712
Is I am not entirely sure that he necessarily

2618
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,248
Has the same like

2619
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,880
I'm not a literal Pez dispenser

2620
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:34,720
The protocols of the Elders of Zion defense all of this b*******

2621
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,000
From that store

2622
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:40,096
Is that all of this

2623
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,632
Yeah

2624
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,448
So

2625
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,728
And stuff

2626
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,800
Particular seems to be router out of disbelief.

2627
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,336
Who created anything

2628
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,408
Great

2629
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,432
These tribal cultures

2630
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,968
People like Erik von daniken

2631
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,016
Whenever they

2632
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,296
Surprising

2633
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,832
Critiques of him

2634
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,624
He just

2635
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,392
He said

2636
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,720
To just quote ignore the realities of our ancestors

2637
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,768
They constitute the ultimate in racism

2638
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,816
He belittles the abilities and

2639
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,584
Ingenuity

2640
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,120
As a whole

2641
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:15,168
Before writing Chariots of the Gods

2642
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,472
Done time in Egypt

2643
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:19,008
Prison for fraud and embezzlement

2644
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,080
Course when he finished the manuscript he had a hard time

2645
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:22,848
I'm selling it

2646
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,384
Because people like now

2647
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,688
You found a publishing house that as well

2648
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,248
Put it out

2649
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,784
Completely rewrite the book

2650
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,024
Okay

2651
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:41,792
So

2652
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:44,352
They are this is the producer meeting

2653
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,120
Reggae

2654
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,680
Listen I'm your literary

2655
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,216
I've got you

2656
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:50,240
This amazing day

2657
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,288
8 is

2658
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,312
Going to be

2659
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,592
We're going to give you

2660
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,128
60%

2661
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,152
Of the proceeds

2662
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,832
Alright

2663
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
We love

2664
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,648
It's great

2665
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,672
You are

2666
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,440
Amazing

2667
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:11,744
We have somebody rewrite

2668
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:17,632
Cornell said now

2669
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,656
Much bigger

2670
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:19,424
Successful

2671
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,472
But course

2672
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,752
So he had to have it Rewritten

2673
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:25,312
His book was Rewritten

2674
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,592
Under the pseudonym

2675
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:30,688
Wilhelm rubber store

2676
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:31,968
No

2677
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:38,368
I wasn't that b*******

2678
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:43,744
No it's probably because odermann was a Nazi writer / filmmaker which is code for propaganda

2679
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,280
Great he was a Nazi

2680
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:46,304
You did not get paid

2681
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:48,608
It always comes back to its

2682
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:52,960
What is wrong with you

2683
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:55,008
I don't know if his theories were asked

2684
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
Actually like Heating

2685
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,384
Jews necessarily it certainly invalidates a lot of trouble people

2686
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
But it is

2687
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:06,784
Interesting that the guy who rewrote it was a Nazi propaganda

2688
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:09,344
So a book

2689
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,136
Published

2690
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:11,904
Super fraud

2691
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,720
Having falsified Hotel records in credit rep

2692
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,280
$3,000

2693
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,816
Over a. Of 12 Years

2694
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:21,376
He unsuccessfully

2695
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:23,936
He unsuccessfully entered a plea of nullity

2696
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,216
On the ground

2697
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,288
Another credit Institution

2698
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:31,104
For failing to adequately research his reference

2699
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:39,040
It's a good argument

2700
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:42,112
13th of February 9th

2701
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:42,880
70s

2702
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,672
The three and a half years in prison

2703
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,512
Wichita book God's from outer space

2704
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Also

2705
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,840
I have one more thing I want to read

2706
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:55,168
I hate to read straight from Wikipedia

2707
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:59,776
There's a lot of respect them generally as a source

2708
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,384
You can find the the backing evidence

2709
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,712
I didn't want to rewrite it cuz it's

2710
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,480
It's just

2711
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,272
Dead on fantastic

2712
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,320
So this is another

2713
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,344
Damning indictment

2714
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,512
Sew-in gold of the Gods

2715
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:21,280
Which is another one

2716
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,304
Cold

2717
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:26,144
Is a lot of things that's a sequel to

2718
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
What's it called

2719
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:30,496
What was the first product

2720
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:36,640
The gods was the first one Gods from outer space as I believe his

2721
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:41,504
His follow-up

2722
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,296
Call

2723
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:47,392
But he got way wrong and then there's like

2724
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:57,376
Describes an expedition that he undertook through man-made tunnels Within

2725
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,656
Riverdale has tires

2726
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,936
Natural cases

2727
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:02,752
System in Ecuador

2728
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,800
He reported seeing Mounds

2729
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,568
Goldstream

2730
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,848
Statues in the library

2731
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:07,872
Containing metal tablet

2732
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:09,408
Considered to be

2733
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:11,200
Evidence of ancient

2734
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,736
Extraterrestrial visitation

2735
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,760
No other explanation

2736
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,296
A local priest father

2737
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:17,088

A collection of gold

2739
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,392
Extraterrestrial route

2740
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:21,952
Lexie said with special permission from the Vatican

2741
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:22,976
Love it

2742
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:26,816
Walter Spiegel

2743
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:27,840
No Expedition

2744
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,376
Description

2745
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:33,216
Have the photos in the book had been

2746
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,776
During the night

2747
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:41,920
During the 1974 interview with the artifact in the tunnel

2748
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:48,320
Pretty embellished some aspects of the story to make it more interesting

2749
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:54,464
Call Beloved

2750
02:14:55,744 --> 02:15:00,608
Make it Aki mazing got to get people that you got to give a little bit of a lizard that like

2751
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:07,264
I don't know what you got to put a little bit in there

2752
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,288
Sell it

2753
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:10,080
In German we say a writer if

2754
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:13,920
She's not writing cure science

2755
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:15,968
German

2756
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,832
And that's what I have.

2757
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:27,744
Four years later he admitted he'd never been inside Cueva de like fry

2758
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:33,888
German for dramatic surge

2759
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,960
A geologist found no evidence of artificial tunnels in the area

2760
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:38,752
Father crespi is gold artifact

2761
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,032
According to an archaeologist

2762
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:43,616
Consulted by Christina were mostly brass imitation sold locally is

2763
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:46,176
Tourist souvenirs Lovett Lovett

2764

Love it

2765
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,992
Let's

2766
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:50,784
Huge fan of every story that begin

2767
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:57,184
A local priest found

2768
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:04,352
I know we probably have gone too far down a Devon

2769
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:09,984
Second hole but whenever I hear him say agartha that is like that is a big red flags

2770
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,776
Especially in the context

2771
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:12,800
Text of Nazi

2772
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:15,104
Because I know he means hollow Earth

2773
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,640
You mean

2774
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:17,664
This version

2775
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:25,600
Yeah there are those words that like I know what that means in this world

2776
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:27,136
Because I spent time on this message

2777
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,928
I've studied this

2778
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:29,952
Stupidity so much

2779
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:31,744
Did I know

2780
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,304
Where is just roll off your back or you might be

2781
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:37,120
Be confused by it

2782
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,400
I had no idea it's

2783
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,704
Play never have occurred

2784
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,240
To me that there was a hole

2785
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:45,568
Like that's like that's the interesting thing about this

2786
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,360
This world that we

2787
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:48,640
We live in and Wyatt

2788
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:50,176
It's awesome that you

2789
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:55,040
Spent way too much yourself

2790
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,832
Through through the

2791
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:57,856
Is

2792
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:59,648
So many of these aside

2793
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:02,720
Some of these little like tossed off factoids

2794
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:06,304
Are like me at like in my world I would just go

2795
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:11,936
But with the knowledge that you have it's like

2796
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:16,544
No that's not more b******* that's b******* that points to the

2797
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,336
Point to this b*******

2798
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,616
And that b*******

2799
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:22,432
Encapsulate the entire whites

2800
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,968
It always comes back to white supremacy

02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:35,232
Next to the other word probably

2803
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:43,680
No I can't

2804
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:46,240
Well it's it's it's like

2805
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:50,592
Like if I could talk for another hour

2806
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:54,688
Privileged knowledge of the crazy

2807
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,992
Yeah

2808
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:59,296
To say that crazy

2809
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:01,344
Privileged knowledge

2810
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,624
Oh weird

2811
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:04,160
Humanity

2812
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:05,696
Because most people don't get

2813
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,512
Because they never put the time and like watching

2814
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:14,656
Video

2815
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:18,752
Right don't find someone who is

2816
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:20,800
Uno's

2817
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:26,688
This guy is out of his Sherpa of b*******

2818
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:32,832
Mountain

2819
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:34,112
And you show us

2820
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,392
Why

2821
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:36,160
It smells bad

2822
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,744
Infowars LLC

2823
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:41,536
No kidding

2824
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:45,120
So at this point they're all the same f****** Mountain

2825
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,656
Already

2826
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,192
Steve

2827
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:49,216
Is made a full pot

2828
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:55,104
Emmett he has said draco's

2829
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:59,200
That's a

2830
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,248
Mark Richards a little bit

2831
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,784
Course

2832
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:03,808
Here's what I

2833
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,880
I hate that I'm saying

2834
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,440
Cuz I feel like it might come off as misogynist

2835
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:11,232
And I don't mean it

2836
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,000
Edsby

2837
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,304
But I think he's in love with

2838
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:21,728
Because the way she is so defensive

2839
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:24,288
See that now that I don't think

2840
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:27,616
People generally are unless Road

2841
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:34,528
Do you know it doesn't

2842
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:40,160
In a way that is beyond a professional

2843
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:44,512
You could just be like hold on what

2844
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:46,816
Yeah yeah

2845
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:51,424
Anyone else challenges

2846
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:54,240
He's a very different

2847
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,008
He

2848
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:57,824
Their interviews if he is like

2849
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,128
Will this guy said some dumb s*** she's like

2850
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:03,200
He said this guy said some dumb s*** so I believe him

2851
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:06,016
She is interviewing

2852
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,832
Says bad words

2853
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:11,136
She goes ape contradict

2854
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:12,160
Hey Ya

2855
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:17,536
Pacific time

2856
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:20,096
Innocent why would I say

2857
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:24,960
Spike your mark Richards doesn't understand it's not yes they're not going to give up

2858
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,776
They will blow everything up before they give up

2859
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:33,920
Ashley I would say he understands more than almost any human I've met on the planet

2860
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:38,272
By virtue of the fact that he's dealt face

2861
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:41,856
Forgot years and so did his father

2862
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:43,904
Aside from that

2863
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,952
You know I appreciate your approach

2864
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:52,608
I will say that there is another level at already

2865
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:54,912
Already it's like

2866
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:55,680
You don't

2867
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,960
You were disrespecting

2868
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:58,496
My main guy

2869
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
From

2870
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:05,408
Before this like an interview

2871
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:11,552
I respect your position by

2872
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:13,088
What sets the

2873
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,368
Movie Pitch meeting

2874
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:15,136
That

2875
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:17,440
I respect what you're trying to do

2876
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,232
Which

2877
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:25,632
Means goodbye.

2878
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,192
For sure

2879
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:31,776
This guy named Eddie page

2880
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,848
Do is got documented evidence

2881
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:38,688
Showing that he's a group of 33 Pleiadians that were brought here

2882
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,576
And I met with the president work for the CIA we're guarded by the CIA

2883
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:45,344
4

2884
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,648
Their entire upbringing and

2885
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:55,328
That has just entered our

2886
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:59,680
I don't see car atmosphere but very close

2887
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:01,728
From the space station

2888
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:03,008
AnnaLynne

2889
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,104
Mothership so it's checking on to it and

2890
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:09,664
I think I can't remember the exact

2891
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:15,552
Measurements black something like 18 MI

2892
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:20,160
I am. Tori things so he said there's more on the way and he

2893
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:22,976
It's interesting because I'm having them on the show

2894
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,280
I think it's tomorrow afternoon

2895
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:26,560
I'm having a bath

2896
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:32,960
And I'm just giving you this heads up because it's interesting

2897
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:38,080
Question is saying that the

2898
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:41,664
Contacting the Pleiades are basically

2899
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,200
Sort of

2900
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:47,808
They are in a brought Jesus they were

2901
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:50,624
Original genome human genome

2902
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:57,024
Right

2903
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,048
Prometheus

2904
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:59,072
Ridley Scott

2905
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,352
Not asbestos

2906
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:01,888
I still think it's a lot more

2907
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,424
Sing the people gave it credit for

2908
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,448
Idris Elba

2909
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:05,472
Fantastic

2910
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,240
Anyways

2911
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,056
Reality

2912
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:17,504
Clips not done but

2913
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,832
I do think there's a remarkable moment there where she like

2914
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:27,232
Whether this is real or not we could talk about another time would you like to talk about

2915
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:31,584
The only thing you should ever be talkin about right

2916
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,352
Time for 8

2917
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:34,144
Cuz it was a whole other interview that

2918
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,240
Boy

2919
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:39,520
You give me some

2920
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:40,288
Red flags to

2921
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:44,128
All of his information comes

2922
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:46,688
Like a psychologist

2923
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:52,576
Directions to General

2924
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:58,976
Sarah whenever so many children

2925
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,328
People f******

2926
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
Locked up

2927
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:07,168
He supposedly was in Vietnam

2928
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,496
Morningsave

2929
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:17,152
He was in the aliens

2930
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:19,200
Is any thought it was like 5 minutes

2931
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:22,528
Later but it was 11 days that he'd spent on an alien ship

2932
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:25,600
Batman Batman they had to regress a

2933
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:26,368
Patty

2934
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:31,232
Miles away

2935
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:34,816
It a different uniform or some s*** right

2936
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,864
Doing drugs in Vietnam

2937
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:40,192
I don't know I don't know it's true

2938
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:45,056
Conversation but

2939
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:49,664
The question is is that they're saying there's no way that we can fight

2940
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:50,944
The Draco

2941
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:57,344
And when and when and which out sort of their help

2942
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,112
And

2943
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,928
Mark Richards this thing is I know this is

2944
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:03,488
But you know I talked to a lot of people Steven

2945
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:05,536
And Richards is saying

2946
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:09,120
He deals with

2947
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:13,216
Originally came from the dinosaurs in the Drake alignment

2948
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:17,056
Sixty-five million years or more ago

2949
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:20,896
You are working with our military

2950
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:26,016
And this isn't he goes into great detail about this and so

2951
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:32,416
He's saying that they are offering their help in other words we're in a situation where yes we have

2952
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,696
Some tool

2953
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:34,976
To fight

2954
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,256
These beings

2955
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:43,680
Earth is been a playground for these beings now for quite a number of Tiana and

2956
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:55,712
You know it's it's kind of I think it you know I appreciate your approach but I think yeah let's not be simplistic about

2957
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:00,576
There's a lot today not that many of them out there

2958
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:03,136
It's not that there's a lot more of us

2959
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:05,184
Okay this is why they want to kill us off so

2960
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,768
So badly because this this whole idea of seven billion humans

2961
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:10,304
It's really dangerous

2962
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:15,168
You know it only takes like four thousand humans to equal the power of a hydrogen bomb

2963
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:17,728
Doesn't make sense at all

2964
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:18,752
I don't know what that means

2965
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:25,152
What does that even mean

2966
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:30,272
And kinetic energy that's like from all of our blood vessels in all of the movement

2967
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:34,880
That's what the 4,000 people made of antimatter that touch 4000

2968
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:40,512
That is not the case if you have like an atom of matter versus answer

2969
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:42,048
It's a hundred percent energy

2970
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:44,864
But that there's

2971
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,912
Right

2972
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:47,680
Exactly

2973
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:48,448
Exactly

2974
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,472
Exact

2975
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,520
70

2976
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,080
But like

2977
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,152
Carrie is

2978
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:57,920
Shutting down

2979
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,200
Sick of it

2980
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:00,992
You don't respect Mark Richard Ray

2981
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:02,016
I don't want to talk to you

2982
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:03,040
Right

2983
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:03,808
Think

2984
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:05,088
Steve Fields at

2985
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:06,880
Forget his punches

2986
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:08,672
Rhys wants to get his points

2987
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,464
He is also kind of

2988
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,232
Checked out

2989
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:13,280
Navigate into

2990
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:15,584
Something that really scares me

2991
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,192
I told you earlier this episode that I have feelings

2992
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,984
Yes about this guy

2993
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,336
We've gone through a lot of different feelings about the clear when I was

2994
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,640
Laying out that you liked

2995
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,664
People off with a gun

2996
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:33,248
But I'm actually the next couple clips

2997
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:35,040
Illustrate that I'm actually

2998
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:35,808
Scared of this guy

2999
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:40,672
The only people who are on Project Camelot like Richards killed a guy

3000
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,440
And all that

3001
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,464
I'm not scared of him

3002
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,744
Isn't Vacaville prison

3003
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,816
I'm not really scared I don't think you do it again

3004
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:50,912
I think he killed the guy under was an accessory of the murder

3005
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,192
On a certain circumstances

3006
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:54,752
Yeah I don't think it necessarily

3007
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:58,080
He's a really scary dude right

3008
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:00,640
Steve Kelly I think it is a f******

3009
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,664
Scary dude

3010
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:03,968
Beginning of this clip

3011
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,736
In the next clip

3012
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:05,760
Play that out

3013
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,624
We already know that you may or may not have been running

3014
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,392
Militia

3015
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:13,184
Here's what right here's what he's doing

3016
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:20,608
And we're waking up that's the thing is like the stuff that we're doing a little Jedi Army okay

3017
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:23,168
Okay right now I don't know how many there are

3018
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:25,472
Nope but it was stuff that we do

3019
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:28,288
We just a little tiny group of people gosh

3020
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:31,104
You know I'm thinking about what's going to happen when I've got

3021
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:33,152
200 million Jedi

3022
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,712
I don't give a damn

3023
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:37,248
You know what this is thing

3024
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:40,576
For 25 million years

3025
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:47,232
The dracko the Anunnaki and the gray have been running amok and destroying everything is screwing up for everybody

3026
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:49,024
Universe and that's over

3027
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,048
And where

3028
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:54,912
Us humans that maybe the hybrids that were created by all these guys I don't care

3029
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:59,776
If you're a gray hybrid and Anunnaki hybrid or or a reptile hybrid

3030
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,312
We're still on humans

3031
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:05,920
And we're brothers and we're going to work together and guess what the Creator put us here

3032
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:06,944
Tequila

3033
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:10,784
Toastmasters the slaves arising up is like 80 all over again

3034
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:15,648
First

3035
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:22,048
Then all the grace on the moon and then when the next time they brew rolls around and we get a visit by the Anunnaki ring to take them

3036
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,864
And we have a lot of help out there

3037
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:25,632
I'll tell you

3038
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:27,680
You talk about Pleiadians my God

3039
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:30,752
The Playdium could even get into the Getty until we open

3040
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:31,520
The door

3041
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:35,360
So I don't know what the hell I'm not sure where you're getting that information

3042
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:39,456
What do you want

3043
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:45,856
Play me just when you go down there to the Getty and you're getting ready to open the door you got all these entities that have been there for 100 million

3044
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:47,648
And you're sitting there waiting behind you

3045
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:54,560
Sure yes there's a lot of help out there we have a big old cheering section and there's a lot of you see this the thing

3046
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:56,096
All these densities

3047
02:29:56,352 --> 02:29:58,400
They don't work together until

3048
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,680
They work together

3049
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:05,312
And it wasn't until our reality merged with the reality of these higher levels than any even became

3050
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:07,360
Reality for them to even get involved in

3051
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:11,712
Sitting out there on the outskirts

3052
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:16,320
They couldn't even get involved in the stop until we simple third density humans

3053
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:22,976
Allowed it to come into our brains and make it reality because it's not it wasn't even part of the Matrix until it was in our

3054
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:27,584
That's not the information I have

3055
02:30:28,096 --> 02:30:34,240
Yeah okay well I'll let you know what resonates is what resonates and I'm sorry you have to go back in history

3056
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:36,800
Farther than that and I appreciate your approach

3057
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:39,872
By the way six dimension

3058
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:46,784
So and then maybe more than that.

3059
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,832
Is a function of time

3060
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:55,232
Density is what we use density as a function and dimensions do you have to deal with

3061
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:02,400
They squabble

3062
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:03,680
50

3063
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:07,520
This is this is like tuna

3064
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:08,800
Arguing

3065
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:10,336
Whether or not

3066
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,872
Star Wars and

3067
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:14,688
Lord of the Rings happened at the same time

3068
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:19,296
Yeah like this is bananas both of you are talking about made up s***

3069
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:25,952
None of this right why are you pulling out 6

3070
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:33,120
Yeah it's pretty crazy

3071
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:33,888
Densities

3072
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:35,936
All right what do you know about density

3073
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:37,728
I don't know s*** about that

3074
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,336
Moving outside

3075
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:46,432
It's a measurement

3076
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,200
2 something

3077
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:55,392
So it's hard to say definitively that this is the exact

3078
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:56,416
Steve is wrong

3079
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:57,952
Cities from

3080
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:59,744
But I would bet almost

3081
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
Everything

3082
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,328
Is where he's drawing

3083
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:05,632
On October

3084
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:07,168
In October 2008

3085
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,960
The user on the message board above tops

3086
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,080
This person claimed to be a part of the Illuminati

3087
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:16,640
Whose personal responsibility was to make him

3088
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:17,664
Himself available

3089
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:18,432
A question

3090
02:32:18,688 --> 02:32:19,200
People have

3091
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:20,992
In order to fulfill the requirement

3092
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,272
People have free will

3093
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,320
This is exactly the same as ours

3094
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,368
Using lesser Magic

3095
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:28,928
Tell you what they're doing before they do it

3096
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:33,280
Right so you have this message

3097
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,304
Be any question

3098
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,840
I'm not going to tell you

3099
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:38,144
But you're at you can ask me any question

3100
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:39,424
It's my responsibility

3101
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:44,544
It's something the Illuminati Bloodlines have to do from time to time

3102
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:47,360
Fill Our obligation

3103
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:50,944
Songs of question

3104
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:54,272
And it's honestly really satisfying

3105
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,040
As far as

3106
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:56,832
Very clear roleplay

3107
02:32:57,856 --> 02:33:01,440
He sets of rules ahead of time like quote I will decide whether or not I will

3108
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:02,976
Two or permitted to a

3109
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:04,000
Your question

3110
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:05,536
If your question is not answered it

3111
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:07,072
Is either because I cannot.

3112
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:09,120
Disclosing her because I can

3113
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:11,168
Was lacking in one or more of the following

3114
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,192
Respect

3115
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:12,960
Intelligence

3116
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:16,800
Decency or that it was otherwise Unworthy of being dignified with a response

3117
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:19,104
Preclude pretty much

3118
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:20,384
Answering

3119
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:22,688
I just didn't want to

3120
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,736
Seems like it everything is cryptic enough

3121
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,760
SB meaning

3122
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,832
Like

3123
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:29,856
Super bloodline

3124
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:30,880
They control everything

3125
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:34,720
However at one point

3126
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:36,768
The poster goes by Hidden Hand

3127
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:37,536
Specific

3128
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:39,328
Pacific prediction

3129
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,352
And to predict

3130
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:41,120
Send are not good

3131
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:47,776
There will be a new currency by the end of 2000

3132
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:52,640
Circles as the latest nailed it

3133
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:55,200
The other predictions

3134
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,736
Specifically that said realshit

3135
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,504
Quotes

3136
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:59,552
Francisco and Damascus will be on

3137
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:01,600
End of 2010

3138
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:03,392
Possibly even sooner

3139
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:05,440
So this person was super way off

3140
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,768
This up because the entire thing was largely based

3141
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:10,304
Around the idea of

3142
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:12,096
Different dance

3143
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:14,400
And how There's a Great Harvest

3144
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:16,192
Which spoiler alert

3145
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,216
Was December

3146
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:17,984
21st

3147
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,896
Yes the Noonday winter solstice son of December 21st 2012 is

3148
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:26,432
The time when the lord of the Harvest

3149
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:27,200
She'll return

3150
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:29,248
You might know him as Nibiru

3151
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:36,672
In preparation

3152
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,488
Nonsense

3153
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:40,512
2012

3154
02:34:41,024 --> 02:34:42,304
Course there's also a bust

3155
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:46,144
Is work is this

3156
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:49,728
I had to write this down because I could explain this

3157
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:54,592
Probably take me I'm already past

3158
02:34:56,896 --> 02:34:59,200
Is pretty heavily derived from Gnostic ideas

3159
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:02,272
Where there's one that's the root of every

3160
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:06,368
Right from everything flows

3161
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:08,416
I'm going to accept that

3162
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:09,952
Alright

3163
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:10,720
Introduced in

3164
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:12,000
In terms of the internet

3165
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:13,024
Experiencing

3166
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,584
Itself as with free will it would mess

3167
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,632
Sincerely desire to experience itself

3168
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:19,424
Externally in this division must

3169
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,448
Bmac

3170
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:23,008
To make his wildly simplified a ton of Illusion

3171
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,288
The created

3172
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,592
Of different levels

3173
02:35:26,848 --> 02:35:29,408
Can experience different aspects of the infinite one

3174
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,432
That makes perfect

3175
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:32,224
It doesn't but I think

3176
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,760
Simplest way to explain

3177
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:34,528
Usher

3178
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:37,344
So these differently level delusions are called Dance

3179
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,648
I turned the poster ends up using

3180
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,672
170

3181
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,440
Time

3182
02:35:41,696 --> 02:35:42,976
Throughout the dialogue

3183
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:43,744
That happened

3184
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:47,072
Course we are said to be in the third density

3185
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:50,400
With the first density you being just a cheap and conscious

3186
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,448
. just whatever consciousness

3187
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:55,264
You're you're alive and conscious rappers

3188
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:58,080
State of conscious

3189
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:00,384
Where your conscious of be

3190
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,944
Sure and then that evolved

3191
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,736
To the third when the consciousness

3192
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,784
Becomes aware of its separate this from

3193
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,576
Which is to say

3194
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,856
The infinite one

3195
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,648
Sure when you reach

3196
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:14,464
Absorb

3197
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,256
Unity of the internet

3198
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:17,792
Sure however

3199
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,072
When You Reach

3200
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:20,096
The 6th

3201
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:23,424
You have the option

3202
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:24,448
Either progress

3203
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:27,008
Ordered to send to help the lower levels evolve

3204
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:29,056
I am going to

3205
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:33,920
Use one of these on your back

3206
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,200
All of this

3207
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:38,528
Explain

3208
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:43,392
May I have the more you talk about it the less I'm interested I have to get through this

3209
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:47,488
Nuggets or details about what densities are a little thin

3210
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,024
But the fourth density

3211
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,352
Search was the density of love the density of wisdom and Light

3212
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:54,400
Density of unity

3213
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:58,240
That's what that means you just get to make up whatever you want to believe me

3214
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,288
So

3215
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:03,616
Is I'm positive that he's getting

3216
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:06,176
These ideas from

3217
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:07,968
Because

3218
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:11,040
Have you overlap right because

3219
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,064
In his lecture

3220
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:15,648
He literally says that we need eight

3221
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:17,696
51% grade in the

3222
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:20,512
Other side of things over the past

3223
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:22,048
To the next level

3224
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:22,816
Which is taken

3225
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,608
Exactly

3226
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:26,912
In order to get to the next density needed

3227
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:28,192
In order to

3228
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,216
You get to the next

3229
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:30,240
Have to be

3230
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:31,008
In service

3231
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:32,032
Two others

3232
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:34,592
Then you go to A+ level

3233
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:36,128
To self you go to a negative

3234
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:38,432
Selfishness versus

3235
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:42,784
The entire thing is basically about this this

3236
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:45,088
Rationalization of

3237
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:46,368
The idea of the Illuminati

3238
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:48,928
These people

3239
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,464
Who need to make

3240
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,744
Very serious

3241
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:54,304
Evil decisions in order to make sure

3242
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,096
They go to the

3243
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:56,864
The 4th Dental

3244
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:57,888
Under the

3245
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:58,656
Negative

3246
02:37:59,168 --> 02:37:59,680
Version

3247
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:01,472
So they have to be super

3248
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:05,056
In order to go to the next level which is good for everyone else does

3249
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:05,824
Cuz it helps them

3250
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,616
Work off their karmic debt

3251
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,408
Right it's a load of all right

3252
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:10,944
Bright so I've gone blind

3253
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,760
It's all the things that you said

3254
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:14,784
I've made me go blind

3255
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,576
It's a hundred percent what are you talkin about

3256
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:17,856
Ateez in

3257
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:25,792
I understand you like why would I even know you're going blind

3258
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:26,560
Mad that I

3259
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:32,448
When I see you about that is like

3260
02:38:34,752 --> 02:38:35,520
Complex

3261
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:36,800
Ridiculous

3262
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:39,616
Load of nonsense thrown together

3263
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:40,896
As though it made

3264
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:42,176
Any sense

3265
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:42,944
At all

3266
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:48,576
I'm not you're arguing that it makes sense but I'm arguing with that

3267
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,880
A hundred percent I know this

3268
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:56,000
By the Erich von daniken version

3269
02:38:56,256 --> 02:38:58,816
Now it's the same thing I can tell you he's getting that

3270
02:38:59,072 --> 02:38:59,584
From this

3271
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,352
Yeah

3272
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:03,680
You making it suck also spoiler alert

3273
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:04,448
Can handle that

3274
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:06,752
Did the Earth is hollow and

3275
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:07,520
Yes definite

3276
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,616
It's important for me to point out

3277
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:13,920
Internet hoax

3278
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:14,688
Is almost

3279
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,968
Certainly riff

3280
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:17,504
From what's known as the Rob

3281
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,552
Material or the law of one

3282
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,856
It's basically another in a long line of

3283
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:25,696
Channel documents alien speaking through

3284
02:39:25,952 --> 02:39:26,720
We talked about

3285
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:27,744
Underpants episode

3286
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,024
Yeah the reason I just

3287
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:32,608
Is being like the raw material is being where he gets it from

3288
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:34,656
Is because

3289
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:36,192
Steve got his II

3290
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,472
That book came out

3291
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:39,264
The raw stuff came out

3292
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,288
The 1980s

3293
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:42,080
Yeah Hidden Hand popped up into

3294
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:42,848
2008

3295
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:46,176
Cuz I'm one of the gun sites that I want

3296
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,968
There's this review from

3297
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:48,992
2009

3298
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:50,016
Yeah

3299
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:53,600
Though I eventually got what I ordered I had already written it off as loss

3300
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:55,648
Because I took a took close to

3301
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:56,672
6 months

3302
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:57,440
Remember correctly

3303
02:39:57,696 --> 02:40:02,304
He wouldn't return calls and I filed reports everywhere local cops even knocked on his door and spoke with him

3304
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,120
And I was talking with ATF about him as well

3305
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,912
When he did what he did send

3306
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:10,496
Enclose the business card

3307
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:11,776
The company spoke to

3308
02:40:12,032 --> 02:40:13,568
I made some comment about me

3309
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:16,640
About 2,000

3310
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:17,408
He got reported

3311
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:18,688
ATF

3312
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:20,224
Raspbian

3313
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:21,248
Fraudulent

3314
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:23,040
Sale guy

3315
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:27,136
Diversified portfolio Illuminati

3316
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:28,160
Inside Iran

3317
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:30,976
Just ripped off stuff that you'd found on message boards

3318
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:32,000
And the internet

3319
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:33,536
Turned it into entire world

3320
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:36,608
Complete

3321
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,656
That is what I believe

3322
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:39,680
The things that I know

3323
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:40,448
Now

3324
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,472
Here is why you need

3325
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:43,008
Need to be super afraid of

3326
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:48,896
You talk about being okay this is the thing okay you know you know about all the super soldier

3327
02:40:49,152 --> 02:40:51,456
I know you people know about that everything

3328
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:53,760
Can I have this entity

3329
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:56,064
That we referred to as Rambo

3330
02:40:56,832 --> 02:40:58,880
And Rambo is

3331
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:02,464
Toxic waste

3332
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:04,256
Okay and

3333
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:06,816
He pretty much will do anything I want

3334
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:10,912
But one of the reasons why these guys won't touch me I think

3335
02:41:11,424 --> 02:41:13,472
I can get away with these things

3336
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:21,408
I don't know if he's met Rambo you'll know what I'm talking about I'm sure that people listening right now that have been trampled

3337
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:24,224
Call Cherian OU

3338
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:25,504
Ever meet Rambo

3339
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:31,392
I know not to my knowledge that sounds like a you know a discarnate entity

3340
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:34,976
He's my altar

3341
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:37,280
Okay

3342
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:42,400
Yeah I don't know what he is exactly

3343
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,472
But he's very active on this plane

3344
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:46,752
And

3345
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:53,408
I like my bodyguard I guess something like that I don't know what you call him but he's been very active lately so

3346
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:55,712
That to me sounds like

3347
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:57,760
I dissociate

3348
02:41:58,016 --> 02:41:58,528
Hurt people

3349
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:04,928
Rambo Florida that's a multiple personality kind of b*******

3350
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:06,720
Multiple personalities

3351
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:07,488
Please doesn't exist

3352
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,608
Dissociative

3353
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:16,704
And the fact that he's aware of it leads me to believe it's not so

3354
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:20,288
Siri

3355
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:24,128
Other alternatives

3356
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,688
Involved

3357
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:27,712
Operation

3358
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:28,736
This f****** scary

3359
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:32,320
The idea that he used to have a militia and now calls it a Jedi

3360
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:33,856
It's f******

3361
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:40,512
Soap.

3362
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,048
It's so

3363
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:44,608
Such a mess because I know I know how people work

3364
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:46,144
I mean eight look if

3365
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:49,984
If

3366
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:56,128
Did the same thing

3367
02:42:56,384 --> 02:43:00,224
I'm not into it

3368
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:01,504
Call themselves

3369
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:03,808
Be there we go now we have a question

3370
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:08,672
We have a conversation

3371
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,696
So

3372
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:11,232
You know he loved to sell gun

3373
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:13,792
But it turns out there's one weapon

3374
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:15,584
Any other weapon

3375
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:17,120
I take issue

3376
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:19,936
Correct

3377
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:24,288
And I'll tell you and you talk to any of these

3378
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:28,640
Super soldiers that they're the real deal and I'll tell you the same damn thing

3379
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:31,200
It doesn't matter what you doing up again

3380
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:34,016
All you got to do is say Jesus Christ in your dead

3381
02:43:36,064 --> 02:43:37,088
It's so easy sounds

3382
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,136
Right I do that time and time again

3383
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:40,160
That's it

3384
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:43,232
You go up against some monster they think they're so tough

3385
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:44,000
Real quick

3386
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:45,536
The power of Christ

3387
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:46,560
Compels you

3388
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:48,608
At this point

3389
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:54,496
Carrie is so checked out that he's just rambling to get like trying to end the show

3390
02:43:55,776 --> 02:44:00,384
You're not coming past me you're nothing you're nothing and all you guys don't even have to

3391
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:06,528
I don't know what hit them

3392
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:09,088
This is the saddest thing I've ever heard we all do it

3393
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:09,856
We all do it

3394
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:12,672
So this is not religion but that's what we do

3395
02:44:12,928 --> 02:44:14,208
Sure that's how it's done

3396
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:16,000
Sure okay

3397
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:18,816
She's so checked

3398
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:21,120
She's like trying this is maybe five

3399
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:22,144
Minutes into her life

3400
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:23,168
Trying to end

3401
02:44:24,192 --> 02:44:24,704
Plug

3402
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:29,568
Plugs plugs his Twitter

3403
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,408
And we

3404
02:44:34,688 --> 02:44:36,224
Okay start I know you

3405
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:37,504
Questions about that

3406
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:40,320
Here is where we get into

3407
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:41,600
Not going to

3408
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:43,904
But you have a petition

3409
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:51,840
What's the simple way to find this stuff

3410
02:44:52,352 --> 02:44:53,376
Well

3411
02:44:54,656 --> 02:45:00,800
If that's the thing about the White House petition patient it won't even really show up on the page until we got at least 200

3412
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:02,336
50 signatures so

3413
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:05,152
Best way to find a courses to

3414
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:07,456
It's just to do a Google search with my name

3415
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:09,760
Under 200

3416
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:16,160
Destroy the demon

3417
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:17,184
He just sad

3418
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:20,256
I just got sad don't even Saturn

3419
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:25,888
Radio show called truthcatradio

3420
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,680
Radio show

3421
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:30,240
How can you have a radio show if you can get 200

3422
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:34,848
They have three.

3423
02:45:35,616 --> 02:45:39,200
Okay

3424
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:44,576
I guess maybe we shouldn't be evil

3425
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:45,600
No

3426
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:48,672
It seems it seems

3427
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:50,208
Bond in terms of what

3428
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:53,280
You can lie about but if you actually get

3429
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:55,840
Do you like you've got this fundraising

3430
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:58,656
3 people who have signed up for you

3431
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:02,240
He spits all this vitriolic s*** on Twitter

3432
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:03,519
Right not like

3433
02:46:03,775 --> 02:46:05,567
It's not like he's doing much better on that front

3434
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:09,407
You see like that guy that guy who was on Infowars is the example I always

02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:11,199
Liking you starting

3436

Everything is so artist

3442
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:23,231
Inflated

3443
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:24,255
Is it easy

3444
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:25,791
To get

3445
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:28,095
The views on your videos

3446
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:28,863
If you name them

3447
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:31,935
Space proof of

3448
02:46:32,191 --> 02:46:35,775
Rat River

3449
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:37,567
SEO you're able to drive traffic

3450
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:39,615
You can have twenty thousand people watching

3451
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:40,383
Your video

3452
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,407

02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:43,199
Translate to s***

3454
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:44,991
Maybe

3455
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:46,527
Still be good but

3456
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:47,551
Get better.

3457
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:54,207
That's the real Jess

3458
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,231
Unfortunately

3459
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:59,327
Evil people are just better in SEO than what it is

3460
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:01,119
They're better than manipulation

3461
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:03,935
Stop right unfortunately

3462
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:06,239
Like

3463
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:09,055

I am so we're not good

3465
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:16,735
Not bad words

02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:21,087
You win maybe that help

3467
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:25,951
For sure anyway does bring them to the end of time

3468
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:26,719
Kelly

3469
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:28,511
On a project

3470
02:47:29,791 --> 02:47:32,863
If you have a ride if you could put a laser on a knife

3471
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,655
You would have sa Industries

3472
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:35,679
As well

3473
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:36,959
Sincerely wish that

3474
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:40,287
Well I was talking about

3475
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:45,919
Stop

3476
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:51,807
Density of bums me out like when you start talking about levels of density

3477
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:52,831
I get

3478
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:53,599
Angry

3479
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:55,647
I don't like this.

3480
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:57,695
Because if you pull out dimensions

3481
02:47:57,951 --> 02:48:00,255
That's fine we can have a fun talk about

3482
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:05,887
That's the issue

3483
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:12,287
Science app with all science fiction where it's like

3484
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:17,151
Dimensional like Shore Fine it doesn't actually mean it

3485
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:18,943
We start talking about like 50

3486
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:24,831
Density bulshit

3487
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,623
Talking nonsense

3488
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:29,951
It doesn't have a thousand year

3489
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:31,999
Science fiction history behind

3490
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,559
No but it is a

3491
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:37,119
At least 20-year b******* history behind

3492
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:39,679
Extra

3493
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:44,287
Because it hit on.

3494
02:48:45,567 --> 02:48:46,591
All the words

3495
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:50,943
Your wheelhouse

3496
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:55,295
I could have got another couple hours honestly

3497
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:57,087
Tight in terms of

3498
02:48:57,343 --> 02:48:58,367
6 hours later

3499
02:48:58,623 --> 02:49:01,439
Just all the s*** I know about this

3500
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:04,511
I know I know

3501
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:09,887
But the moment we got into Atlanta stuff I was like s*** Dan's going to talk first
