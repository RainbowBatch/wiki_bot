00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
You do not recognize how long that theme song is until you're sitting across the room for someone who didn't

5
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
No that was probably going to play as we were starting to show

6
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
So hate everybody here's the thing

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
Jordan is still on vacation

8
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,592
Until Monday

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
Who do you have an episode for Monday

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
And so I was at I was in a little bit of a pickle

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
And thankfully

12
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
Someone is in town visiting and

13
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Is a person who

14
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
A friend of the show I would say I think that's fair

15
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,976
You been on before remotely over the first time

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
Well we've met in person on this trip someone who's

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Brian stelter's new best friend

18
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
Just a recently unreliable sources

19
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
Jared Holt

20
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
Damn thanks so much she had been in contact through the years but here I am and HQ cats here

21
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
Tea2go I know that you're somebody who gets

22
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Hangouts

23
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,440
Enzo like I wanted to really try and bring that energy out of you with the other theme song

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
Jared Holt notorious hype guy

25
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
Yeah you're like the DJ Khaled of right-wing

26
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Spell researchers

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Oh

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,568
Yeah I don't know about that but that's not the right example I feel like

29
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
He has gone from somebody who like was known for being like that the guy who yell on tracks to the guy who does not perform

30
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Oral sex on women

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
I feel like his whole reputation changed in that

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
And that

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Anyway we're off traffic

34
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
It is it is

35
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Somewhat

36
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
It's it's always a

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
A little bit challenging to to figure out exactly what the show is without

38
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
One half of that you know whatever

39
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Whenever I have a conversation with somebody else it's going to like

40
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,456
What word what would we do but I think it was going to be a little bit different since I think you and I have

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
Fairly similar mentalities at least similar

42
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Worlds of Fun

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
Cuz you know we both look at a lot of the same kind of

44
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
Right-wing media landscape and do a lot of criticism about it

45
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
Sands

46
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
You know I think I think that that that

47
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
Provide a lot of interesting that insight

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Yeah I hope so I mean you and I have

49
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Kind of a similar approach where

50
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
We're fairly Clinic

51
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Call about it

52
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Where

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
I don't know it like it is very easy to get

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
Like upset or frustrated with this kind of stuff and

55
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
You and I both share

56
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
The gift

57
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
And curse of being completely dead inside

58
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,416
Volta consume this in and process it and hopefully help it makes sense.

59
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,280
I don't like that you put it that way but you're probably right I think there's a

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
2

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Pretend

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,424
Maybe I'm not maybe this isn't totally accurate but I like to pretend that it's like academic detached

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Like I can be pissed off at these things that RBM listen

64
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
What I'm hearing

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
But that's not going to help

66
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
My ability to convey the information

67
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
As I can be attached that from

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
The work

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Or whatever

70
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Yeah it it helps to think that your

71
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Trying to do something about it

72
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
It does it does the bee that does make it

73
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Less frustrating

74
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
So what I wanted to do

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
We should tell folks

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
A little bit

77
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Pre-pandemic

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
Before covid ever came to Via word we knew about

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
You and I had gone back and forth a little bit on Twitter

80
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
And we were talking about

81
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
The phenomenon that we were noticing that was

82
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
Alex

83
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
Infowars we're becoming buddy-buddy with Nick Fuentes

84
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
And how bizarre that was

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
We had wanted to

86
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,719
Get together and have a little conversation about

87
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
How are feelings about that

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Then

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
A worldwide pandemic happen

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Kansas it kind of knocked those

91
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Plans off track

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
I bet it looked for a little bit like

93
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Their friendship or

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
There there's a relationship wasn't going anywhere

95
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
But now

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
It blossomed again

97
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Yeah I mean Nick is

98
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,807
Hosting some of his videos on the Infowars site

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Yeah

100
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
We consider that a pretty

101
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Astounding develop

102
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Yo Alex and Nick or both

103
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
Appearing at the same rallies working together for stop this teacher

104
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
And I mean they were together I mean they really

105
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Grown closer together and it's

106
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
It's interesting we were talking before we started recording it's not really a perfect match

107
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
Like the whole creeper white nationalist stuff I mean certainly

108
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
Alex has broadcast elements of that movement or rhetoric on his shoulder throughout the years and

109
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Various capacities but

110
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Styling

111
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Strategy-wise it's

112
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Is chi like two different

113
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
Extremist world's coming together

114
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
It's really interesting to see

115
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
Kind of where that is machine and where it's not

116
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
I think

117
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
Interesting Lee I think strategy

118
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
You know like that is that end of things I think is actually fairly compatible

119
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Because it is

120
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Kind of

121
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Attention-grabbing base

122
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Dodge Stratus

123
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,855
Thinking alike at least in terms of on the ground and all of his followers will go and like disrupt

124
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Turning Point

125
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Event

126
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
And it would get a lot of attention and

127
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
Alex would go bullhorn people

128
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
And that gets him tons of attention to

129
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
But I think

130
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
I think what you mean is more like strategy behind like social

131
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Policy

132
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Google what their goals would be

133
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,919
Yeah I know so just kind of how they see the vehicle into influence and power somebody like next 20

134
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Yeah just

135
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
White nationalist

136
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Unless he's getting criticism that he's just kidding

137
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Comedian

138
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Complete coward by the way

139
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
Way more respect if you just own it but like

140
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
I'm not saying it's a lot of respect putting at least

141
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
A smidge maybe a very cynical way of loathsome respect

142
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Yeah I guess that's the way to put it

143
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
But nixies his

144
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,431
Strategy as you know they do these disruptive events they go to Turning Point USA conferences

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Are there a c-pack a few weeks ago as we're recording America on canceled

146
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
How did act like Dixon like

147
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
They get attention there's a ton of press it all the things they go to

148
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
And

149
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
Their hope is to kind of siphon off enough of

150
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
The energy that's going on with those

151
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Cribs

152
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
To become

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Type of

154
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
Stakeholder in

155
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
The broader scene

156
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Dad demands

157
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
You don't if not

158
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Respect at least some sort of

159
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Like catering or compromise

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Where is Alex I

161
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
I don't know that he's really

162
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Scene

163
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
His goal as like

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Mainlining

165
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
Into the GOP or like he hasn't

166
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,279
Particularly targeted young people the way that Nick has and it would like to

167
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Yeah I mean I'm sure he'd love

168
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Too but I might could have seen

169
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
So much

170
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Coherent strategy

171
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,287
I know that's truth I've always thought of is like

172
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,407
Nick and Alex are very different in as much as I think that Nick has a political project he's working on

173
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
And Alex's just corner

174
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
You know like he has at like there's an ideology behind Alex and like there's but there's beliefs that he has and there's things that he would like to see

175
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Put in place in terms of

176
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,583
Do you know let me eat some of it. Does overlap with Nick like immigrants sentiment certainly they both share

177
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
But Alex definitely

178
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
He doesn't have

179
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
The the same like a desire to

180
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Really augment the GOP

181
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
He wants Alex wants the GOP to be weirder like him

182
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,295
Where has Nick wants to gain sort of access to the means of power

183
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Yeah because

184
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Nick

185
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Unfortunately have

186
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
The experience of being one of the first people to lie

187
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Like really critic

188
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Kaepernick

189
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Check in

190
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Reporting for rightwingwatch

191
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
It's time

192
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
And

193
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
All he's wanted

194
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
The whole time

195
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
It's just

196
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
To command some kind of respect in the Republic

197
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Looking party because he

198
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
What's this young guy based

199
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Around here in Chicago

200
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,831
Don't rub it in went to school was anti-trump then was pro-trump then God dislike

201
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,695
Shity little gig at right side broadcasting network before it was anything

202
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
Think I can from that being like

203
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
For saying something along the lines of

204
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
Like I wasn't CNN anchor should be hanged

205
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
You know and

206
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Just got bitter about

207
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,471
Got it you know and well and it he's

208
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
You know what his view he's doing all this stuff to support the

209
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Did Trump cause it away that

210
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Is truer to the Trump

211
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Cosden

212
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
A place like Fox News my Shirley

213
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,319
And believes that he is entitled to some kind of throne

214
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
You know Tippy some kind of intellect

215
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,207
I think he's really bitter towards Charlie Kirk

216
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Because Charlie Kirk is a

217
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
Bumbling Dofus should be Charlie Kirk you know

218
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Yeah I think

219
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,959
I think on some level if you take away like how a toxic of people they are

220
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
I get that

221
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Nick is better at this

222
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Charlie Kirk

223
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,639
But I think that he's like I think that the problem

224
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,503
With that entitlement is is not understanding what the requirements of the giga

225
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,623
The fact that Charlie Kirk easy bumbling doofus is the reason he fits into that hole

226
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
The Pact

227
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Nick has a

228
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,119
A sense of himself and feels entitled means he does not qualify for that role now

229
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Because he would end up f****** up the game

230
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
You'd end up going off script you would end up

231
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Advocating for some position that the

232
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,895
The people who are bankrolling everything don't want him to and then

233
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Well

234
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
This is a problem

235
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,295
Yeah that's that's how it goes and not to mention that

236
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Around

237
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,183
Geez I don't know 2016 2017 2018 and

238
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
For Fox sake the rest of the year

239
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
He's been toying with

240
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
You know what was

241
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Call the alt right at that time

242
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Mingling very close with

243
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,079
Some really Grizzly like white supremacist so Yad

244
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Nowak away

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
Themes of Holocaust denial rambling on about anti

246
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Jewish conspiracy theories

247
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,343
And it doesn't matter what he does or what he changes at this point

248
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,207
He has done enough damage to himself already that he is like never going to be the true

249
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Charlie Kirk unless

250
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
You know

251
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
There is some sort of Insurgency type movement

252
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Within

253
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
The younger GOP base

254
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,775
Yeah yeah and I think you can see that that is what he would like to incite

255
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Yeah

256
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,663
Almost out of self-preservation interesting Lionel do you put it that way it almost seems like well

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
This is the only shot I have it relevance is to

258
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Cement

259
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Extremism

260
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
But I can ride the wave of

261
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Yeah and

262
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,719
You know Nick wants to write it to power Alex wants to ride it to sell Superman

263
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Male vitality

264
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,375
Keep himself afloat maybe younger and Alex's career he had asked

265
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Aspirations

266
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
I bought

267
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
I don't even know if they were

268
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
As explicit as

269
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Azadi

270
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Nexar

271
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,407
Yeah yeah I would I would say so from looking at other periods and Alex's career I think

272
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
Enemies closer but certainly not to the to the degree that

273
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
But Nick is at

274
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Like what is e22 now like

275
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,927
Now it's like he has he has a very sharp Focus

276
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Young age

277
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
I'm your you're bringing up

278
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
Like I school did you ever have you watched his videos from high school

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
A handful here and that just enough to like kind of get the gist of what I was reporting out at the time just to be like

280
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
F*** is this

281
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Because

282
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Even

283
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Years ago I mean it's probably

284
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Three or four years ago

285
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
At this point

286
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
When I first kind of caught wind of Nick and

287
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
I was watching his videos I was like

288
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
This guy is Young

289
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
This guy is

290
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Forbetterforworse

291
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
Sharp

292
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Extremely well in like

293
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Depending on what this guy dies it could be very potent

294
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
And I think

295
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
For the side effects of that potent

296
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Yeah you're getting elected officials like Paul

297
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Cosar in Arizona

298
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Michelle Malkin very prominent

299
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Calling this for decades

300
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Throwing their weight behind

301
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Because they see him is like the

302
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
The next generation of what

303
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
They do

304
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Yeah

305
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
And somebody who has like the ability to

306
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Be afraid

307
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
Of of what they do you know like he has the

308
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
The ability to enter hostile spaces

309
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
And Come Away with at least some modicum of

310
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Like wow

311
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
That didn't destroy me

312
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
Argue with people who disagree with him

313
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
He's very slick

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
He is

315
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,271
I got the exact same sense from him the first time I came across him as well

316
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
.

317
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Friend of mine

318
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Was really into like those online debate

319
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
Unlike those that is what I want to just yell at each other and

320
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,839
Welcome to the political debate we've gathered

321
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
8 people

322
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
Each other room have an undergrad degree

323
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,287
Isn't there like alright we go now to base tonight

324
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
30

325
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,407
And then face 934 gets on there and it's just like

326
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
I hate gay people and then I was like that's terrible and that's the debate

327
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
It's 2 minutes like the rest of you

328
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,023
I would watch some of these and I believe this friend of mine was really into destiny

329
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
And so I watched his debate with Nicolette ass

330
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,471
And I that was I think where he first came into my scope of awareness in

331
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
I thought like this guy is

332
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
F*** it dangerous

333
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
He is really good at making bad points

334
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
And he's really young

335
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,783
To show his potential shelf life

336
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Is a long long time

337
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Things have gotten much harder for him lately

338
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
I don't know what f****** did it right but

339
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
You know

340
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
What was left of

341
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,887
His access to social media platforms finally pulled the trigger and it was amazing it took that long

342
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Yeah it's

343
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,543
You could have verified account on Twitter until like it's like 60 weeks ago

344
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,687
And would speak like very explicitly Southern Poverty Law Center put out a report that

345
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Took a big look at sort of

346
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
The problems with Twitter and how it relates to extremism

347
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
And inquire that

348
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Report they brought up

349
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
What does an

350
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
They pulled this quote that I think

351
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Like Illustrated sorta what

352
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Was interesting here really well where Nick was like

353
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Oh yeah you know I

354
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,983
I got banned from YouTube or I get banned from dlive or whatever and then I just tweet the link and then everybody goes and follows me on the neck

355
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
I'd like that was kind of his

356
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Last really effective Mega

357
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
And now he's on telegram I guess but I am still active

358
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
About how much he hates Telugu

359
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
And like he's not he

360
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
We probably are terrible

361
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Communication medium

362
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
But it's one way

363
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Right yeah

364
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
So it's like he

365
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Send a message

366
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
And it's not like his

367
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Followers really like

368
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
It's not like Twitter where they getting their replies and they just like

369
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
People fight with each other that there's no endorphin rush

370
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,847
It's just yeah it's one way I guess there's like you count on it

371
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
If you opened up if you open up that telegram Channel where people who comments on it it would just be like

372
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,807
Like insanity I'm his phone would blow up

373
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
I saw that he's on Rumble

374
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
Like there's that video platform where people can just post s***

375
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,839
What are the things that I thought was really interesting as looking at

376
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
How unattractive that is

377
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Yeah Rumble

378
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Donald's

379
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,799
Junior's on Rumble that's where the flagship I think Dinesh D'Souza

380
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Other great philosophical mind sure

381
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Use Rumble

382
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
Sam heughan on people used Rumble for a while

383
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
I don't know if that's as prominent anymore but

384
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Grievously

385
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,487
Dallas traffic previously by only interaction with it was

386
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
When Owen Shroyer did that

387
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,143
Caravan along the east coast

388
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Verstappen the steel

389
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,519
I bet the person who was along with him was only posted

390
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Thnks FR trembles as the only time I've been there

391
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
I've no real sense of the site they

392
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
I went

393
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
2 G preparing this episode I went to Nick's Channel

394
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Very very low counts

395
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,183
And if I were him I would actually see Infowars as one of the more viable Outlets

396
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
That has actual people

397
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
Around and that kind of scares the s*** out of

398
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
The rumble and seeing the good view count

399
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
I would be like well at least he has his own thing off Alex's

400
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
Space yeah but it like on Alex's platform I was super skeptical of it when

401
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
And he watched it

402
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
But some of the videos on there

403
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
Pulling in hundreds of thousands of views I don't know

404
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
I haven't looked at

405
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
The buchanans fornix videos on there

406
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
You know occasionally you get a viral Banger on

407
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Don Alex

408
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
It's not it's not super common if the numbers aren't like what they used to be on on like a YouTube or whatever

409
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
But it's still it's still more than

410
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Then like

411
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
It's more than nothing

412
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Nick's views art

413
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Huge but they're better than on

414
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
Like let's say a rumble type platform

415
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Which

416
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,735
Would you would be something that you would take into consideration if you're looking at a market

417
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,367
And one of the things that you were saying you were skeptical when Alex launched that

418
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
I was skeptical

419
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
When Nick came around

420
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,559
Because I thought there was no way that Alex was going to let him be explicit

421
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
And I was wrong

422
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:22,751
What Nick got into Infowars was sort of threw they like

423
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
At the time

424
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
Harrison Smith was having him on

425
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,199
Owen and him might hit it off pretty well yeah it's like he almost came in through like

426
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
The trapdoor

427
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
Bourse

428
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
And then Alex was like look at this picture

429
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,183
I always remember like when I was younger I was told that even if you didn't like

430
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,535
Graduate from high school even if you never took the SAT or act

431
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
If you went to to summer school classes at the University of Missouri you be automatically enrolled then

432
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Next semester as a student

433
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,567
And that's kind of what naked with Infowars

434
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Yeah

435
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
I remember to like the

436
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
The first like real

437
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Indication that I had that something was like

438
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Trouble

439
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
Was the c-pack from last year I believe

440
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
When Alex went

441
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
And

442
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Got too drunk

443
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
And fell asleep before his speech

444
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,327
And then Nick was kind of just taking over the room

445
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
And like you could see

446
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
Becky had a farm or

447
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Potent

448
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Sway over

449
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
The audience then b y mean Alex was

450
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Sleep

451
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
But the rest of the people there didn't have any kind of connection

452
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
That was close to 2 what Nick was bringing

453
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,783
Those those a little bit bad Q he took over

454
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Alex's own is that

455
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
More or less

456
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Yeah and I

457
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
That was going to kind of happen anyway I've gone to seapac several years I haven't gone since the pandemic

458
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
But that z-pack

459
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
I

460
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,191
Did go to I did not go to the Infowars event because of years ago right as two years yet

461
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
I didn't go to the Infowars event because at that point

462
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
I mean I'm a known enough quantity to this

463
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
These people that

464
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,991
It's almost nope I can't do reporting if I go there because as soon as I show up I just get like swarmed

465
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
And it

466
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
Yeah you become the story

467
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
Get out of my job

468
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Yeah

469
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
I tend to just skip it or as like watching it or whatever but

470
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
C-pack generally as an event like

471
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Certainly there's some donors that are around

472
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,144
Some older activist Xeno passionate adults

473
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
But

474
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
It's in it's like this for almost

475
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
Une major-conference ravent in d.c.

476
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
The pack the numbers with college

477
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Like

478
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
What happens on the stage

479
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
Is for the cameras

480
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
And there's media it's like a media circus and then there's also like

481
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
The underbelly of all these conferences is

482
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
Bringing in young college kids and trying to rear up

483
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
The next generation of the conservative movement is the conservative movement

484
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
Has been so shity the last

485
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
Couple decades frankly at pulling in younger

486
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Generations to their cause

487
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Because Nick

488
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,360
The way he Styles himself being young personally and also

489
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,456
You know borrowing rhetoric and and stylings from

490
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
You're popular

491
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
Twitch streamers or memes and jokes stuff like that

492
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,648
Is resonates with the younger audience sure and I think

493
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,744
You know Pat an event like c-pack there's probably more people

494
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Numbers-wise

495
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
In a crowd that

496
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
Could be pulled to somebody like Fuentes then

497
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
You know I don't know how many

498
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
DieHard Infowars listeners are just roaming around c-pack infect was a time when they go to see packets just to go be a thorn in the side

499
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Until they get asked to leave

500
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Yeah yeah yeah I guess that

501
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
That makes sense

502
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
I mean I think the

503
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
Someone like Alex probably has a difficult time

504
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Connecting with

505
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
So you've because these don't care about

506
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
The Red Scare

507
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,048
There's a little bit of you're an old man

508
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,608
And I think that even like a lot of the insults

509
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
That we see thrown around

510
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
By Nick

511
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
Reply to Alex

512
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,312
That's another thing that I think is really funny about this incompatibility is that

513
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
On its face

514
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
These two dudes

515
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Are like

516
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Most of

517
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
What makes Nick brand work

518
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,856
Is opposition to what Alex stands for

519
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:27,232
Which is like Boomer 1776 taking America back Revolution

520
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:32,352
Nick on his own child care what color you are

521
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
Sonic show he he talks about people that

522
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Use that kind of rhetoric

523
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
I mean I won't say what he calls them

524
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
He speaks very lowly offset

525
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
Yeah and then he goes on info or isn't it he's almost just like

526
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,504
Almost feel like you can see it in his face sometimes he's like

527
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,088
He knows that key kind of maybe

528
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
For his career should be doing this but like

529
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Isn't

530
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
Incredibly down either

531
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
You just took happy that have access to large

532
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,144
Which audience to do

533
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
But it's like this is beautiful got to do it

534
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
You just got to do it there's a crowd there

535
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
You know just whatever

536
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
Yeah you get that sense of just like

537
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,432
Yeah I'm checking this off the list I'm just doing this

538
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,272
And the other thing too on this thing compatibility note

539
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Is

540
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
We were talking earlier about

541
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Turning Point

542
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
Feud with with Nick

543
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
And one of the big things that they used as a as a wedge

544
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
In those whenever they would disrupt the Turning Point events was Israel

545
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,704
Yep they would bring up Israel and it would be like a why won't you denounce

546
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
You know

547
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
This exact strategy

548
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
Could be quite effectively used against.

549
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Yeah

550
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
I don't understand

551
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Somebody like Alex

552
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Could walk

553
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
What

554
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Nick

555
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
And his fan base

556
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Would have done

557
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,488
Act like exploiting Turning Point USA and not realize like well

558
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,584
Yeah like that's like one of the few territories Alex

559
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
Can't be a little hesitant to go I hate

560
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
There once or twice

561
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
But like you know generally

562
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Softwalk

563
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Very much

564
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:22,176
Very much so to the point where I actually don't fully know what is full position

565
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,248
I think that is probably on purpose

566
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Keep it in figures enough that

567
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
Folks in the audience that

568
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
You know believe

569
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
In all kinds of anti-Semitic

570
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Conspiracy theories don't

571
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Drop it

572
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
Not specific enough that he gets in trouble

573
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
The other part of the audience that

574
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
You know it is supportive

575
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
The state of Israel

576
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah

577
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,288
I I think I think that that is probably a strategic

578
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
Move on his part

579
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
And probably wise for his his brand

580
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,480
But it's also the exact thing that someone like Nick would would be like

581
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
No

582
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Have a position

583
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,928
Why won't you have a but that's basically what he was yelling at Charlie Kirk but all those events and I just feel like Alex should know that

584
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Might be,

585
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Down the road

586
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
From within your own organization now

587
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
Yeah I mean Boosie with

588
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
Nick not being on these platforms and

589
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
Losing access

590
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Send

591
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
You'll be in a position where he has the

592
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
Potential to

593
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Start circling the drain quite a bit

594
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,712
We'll see if Alex can

595
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
How long he can hold on

596
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
I am

597
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Pretty curious

598
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
You know cuz

599
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
There's

600
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Almost two ways it could go right

601
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
On one hand Alex is so cynical and

602
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
You know

603
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
It's kind of half

604
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Consciously doing his show at the

605
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
This point that

606
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,032
Just like yeah whatever we're getting the numbers in this is about censorship this isn't about what anybody

607
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Perfectly sane

608
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
And then there's

609
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
The other part where he's just like oh maybe

610
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Maybe we can make host the videos but he doesn't

611
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
I come on the show anymore that sort of

612
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
Good thing it's it'll be interesting to see where those chips

613
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,136
Well I feel I feel like it's no matter what

614
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Going to be bad

615
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,512
I don't feel like you can have these influences in the same like

616
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Pot

617
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Turn on a little bit of heat

618
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Not turn into

619
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
Does utter chaos but

620
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
But we'll see I'm going to keep track of it and

621
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,312
I wanted to do was

622
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
I wanted to just

623
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
Discuss a little video that of Nick Fuentes is that he put on

624
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,272
Infowars something now Alex has to deal with

625
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
I

626
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,928
In preparation for this episode I wanted to go and watch some of his

627
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Knicks

628
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Platform

629
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Work

630
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
And I was shocked how bad it is

631
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Not even like a fence if I could have some of that stuff but it's just also

632
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Bad

633
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
It's also just really doesn't seem like he's trying all that hard

634
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Yet he's really gotten in his own head lately

635
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,616
And my I feel like half the show he's just he just talks about

636
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,456
He's almost pulling a Laura Loomer every time she opens her mouth she's like

637
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,832
I'm so persecuted is so terrible blah blah blah blah it just goes on and on and

638
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
For like 20 minutes and then at the end is like

639
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,232
Let's check the Super Chat I opposed text censorship

640
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
2

641
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,816
That's important look at a Google it and

642
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,168
Dia the one I watched one and

643
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
He was

644
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
Good-looking 5 minute rant

645
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,616
About how he wants to be a martyr but like not like Jesus he doesn't want to get crucified

646
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
He wants to cuz crucifixion would suck

647
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
You find being a martyr like he's on a no-fly list

648
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,088
But even if he was crucified he probably go to heaven so that would be great

649
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
I like

650
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,416
I don't know what this this is

651
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
Listen to Alex Jones all the time like I didn't I thought that was

652
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Kind of

653
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
Uncompelling

654
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Broadcasting

655
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
And I was this a******

656
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Yeah

657
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,848
Yeah let's listen some clips alright this is a speech this is from a speech that Nick gave

658
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
It is on Infowars now

659
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Is hosted on there

660
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
Is about opposition to feminism

661
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
Classic

662
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Popular political position

663
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Sure

664
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
Anti-feminism is a galvanizing

665
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,816
Force within some of the some of the Proto trumpian communities

666
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
The definitely

667
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
Fueled a lot of the anti sjw

668
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,240
Kind of outrage

669
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,616
I think that there's a difference between what you might call

670
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
Classical

671
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,504
Anti-feminist ideas and what Nick is bring to the table

672
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
And I will see that

673
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
Here we go we're going to

674
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Give it a start

675
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Now they call me sexy

676
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
That one is just

677
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
Portneuf Library

678
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
And it's almost half

679
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Right wing

680
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Women life

681
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
For example

682
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
You know Alex

683
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,864
Large

684
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,896
So I think this is one of the issues with

685
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
With dealing with like someone his age and

686
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Baby

687
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Humor maturity level and the

688
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,648
Trying to mix the issues that he's trying to cover with

689
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
She's ugly

690
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:58,048
Yeah it is seems almost explicitly aimed at like 14 year old boy

691
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Who are angry

692
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,008
Yeah and that's like particularly what is concerning to me about Fuentes as he goes through the years is

693
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
He aims

694
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
Young

695
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Why don't like a Crowder type like he's clearly

696
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
Somebody who is like I know

697
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
Once you reach a certain age

698
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,344
You're probably not going to be interested in this b*******

699
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
It's

700
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
He's like

701
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Part

702
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Stand-up comic

703
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,096
Even though as I try to imagine that set in like literally any Comedy Club names like

704
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,400
Alex Clark right in the audience

705
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Who who the f***

706
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
I think it's in Shinto right-wing stuff and even I had to look up who she was

707
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:47,456
That she doesn't Instagram show for tpusa who who cares

708
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,296
That's what I studied about this is like imagining it as a stand-up said it's like

709
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,160
Also imagining it as like a serious political thing is also like

710
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Where were you doing

711
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Yeah

712
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,304
I got into a fight with this commentator for Turning Point USA

713
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,912
This is the Cornerstone of these this lecture that I'm going to get it's absurd

714
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
In both space

715
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
Yeah it's just

716
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
I don't know I just don't get it

717
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Really

718
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
I mean I get it I get

719
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
What the point

720
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
But

721
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
The way he's going about it it's

722
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Eats

723
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
It kind of makes me sick

724
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
A little bit to think

725
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,720
Like a mansion if you and I were putting out the show but

726
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
We are putting on the like hello it's

727
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
What's the meme like

728
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
How do you my fellow kids or whatever oh you have Steve Buscemi

729
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,008
Meme yeah yeah we open up the podcast and I'm just like

730
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,152
Epic dabbed and that's so f****** sick yeah Alex Jones he looks like he's got a

731
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
Is it for a head

732
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,416
It's it would be something worth taking seriously

733
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,256
There's some real political action to back it up

734
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
We have to take it serious about the Trap and that's the problem

735
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,704
And I think the understanding that trap is it's important to recognize that

736
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
You have this

737
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
ThinkPad stand up

738
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Political thing

739
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,712
That is absurd but it also veers into that he's complaining about Alex Clark

740
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
And this is one of his complaints

741
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,576
But he brings up almost immediately upon bringing her up

742
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Can I see these pictures

743
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
You ever see him

744
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
Sit there we go

745
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
You have this

746
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Joke that's not a joke

747
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Yeah exactly

748
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
And it's

749
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
It's kind of clever because

750
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
When throughout the years people like myself

751
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Thor

752
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Places like

753
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Southern Poverty Law Center

754
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
Anti-extremism people

755
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Have criticized Nick

756
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:20,800
He's kind of hidden under the it's an edgy joke it's a stand-up comedy you note when

757
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,384
20 years ago you go to a comedy club and hear this but

758
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Don't think Nick is even old enough to know if that

759
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
That's true or not that's just like something some

760
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
One told him one time

761
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,416
Yeah he might just say Lenny Bruce and then never know who he was

762
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
The thing is like let's if you want take it from like the perspective of a joke

763
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
Like the joke here is

764
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,984
That Nick thinks it's gross that someone who's not black would be in a Jacuzzi with a black

765
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
I don't know what the joke is

766
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Yeah it's not

767
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
Choke

768
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
It's just

769
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
Hate I guess the joke is

770
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,528
Like the only possible joke is him parroting being racist

771
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
For the sake of being

772
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Anti-rape

773
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
And that's clearly not what he's doing

774
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,744
Damn this podcast is taking a turnitin thing could be Nick Fuentes Secret

775
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Text Ashley

776
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,912
Inside job I remember I had a friend when I was younger who was pretty convinced

777
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
That Colter was a performance artist

778
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,568
I'm like all of it was an elaborate parody of right-wing

779
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Stop and

780
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,968
I thought that was fascinating back when I used to smoke a lot of weed and

781
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
Damn bro I think they'd say if I were younger maybe someone would make that argument about Nick likes equally this is all parrot

782
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Do you like no it's not it's just

783
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Poorly thought-out

784
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
Bigotry that's being masked by like

785
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,352
A very thin sheet

786
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah

787
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Very thin

788
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
I don't know how it gets

789
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
It's like a queen.

790
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,640
Right through it

791
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
I'm so in this next leap year

792
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,296
Begins to lay out with his problem with feminism isn't it relates back to

793
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Clark

794
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
Clark a little bit but it actually doesn't

795
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
It relates to a friend of Alex Clark

796
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
Which is really weird

797
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
When your suprabha with famine

798
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
And don't say things like

799
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
Example

800
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
You know the first second every wave leading up to the

801
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
The reason they called me at Zach sister a woman-hater like Robert

802
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
I actually believed in real traditional value

803
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
It'll tell you what I mean by that

804
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
IC pachter against

805
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
And if you're Christian you have to be against

806
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:07,200
It really is your human being

807
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
If you see what they do

808
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Go in there

809
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
This is Barbara

810
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,632
Andover it's Deepak they're opposed

811
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,936
I think that's a very standard

812
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,288
Abortion is kind of

813
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
Starting the story

814
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Middle

815
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Unplanned

816
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
So now here is where he gets into his problem

817
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
It's the way you have an opposition to abortion

818
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
That's starting the problem in the middle

819
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
That's like you have a problem

820
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,792
That you think is the problem and it's abortion but there's actually a problem over here beforehand

821
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Yeah I mean

822
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
Beneath all the way

823
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
Weird jokes that aren't jokes in like

824
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Almost

825
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
The openers are almost like

826
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,568
Stand-up comedy Reggie twitch streamers

827
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
Rhetoric

828
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Knicks

829
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,944
Whole rhetorical strategy and

830
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Yahweh

831
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Extremes do this all the time

832
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
Used to present themselves as like

833
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
The trooper

834
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
You've heard this your

835
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
You're not in your head

836
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
But let me tell you

837
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
This is a stop

838
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
It does not fix the prop

839
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
In my head

840
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Dissolution that's his whole

841
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
That is his whole purse

842
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Presentation is the truer conservative because

843
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
That's what I was saying

844
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
He believes he deserves

845
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
Play some somebody like Charlie Kirk because

846
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
As he thinks he is a truer

847
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Iteration

848
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Trump

849
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Which

850
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
As somebody who didn't

851
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Like Trump too much I

852
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
Fight him on that you can take that mantle if you want to go for it I won't correct

853
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Dubai

854
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
Yeah it's

855
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
It's interesting

856
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Because this is what he's been doing for years

857
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,096
Yeah but the rhetorical strategy that you're talking about is definitely there

858
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,424
And I think the other thing that he's doing is

859
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,496
He's taking this thing that everybody in the room agrees on

860
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
And that is that we're against

861
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,872
Because obviously can hear from their response this is a

862
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Anti-choice crap

863
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
So he's taking that agreement

864
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
And then he's twisting it into

865
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Well

866
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:23,904
If you agree with this you actually also agree with this other thing that you probably actually

867
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
Don't and there's not really

868
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Connective tissue to get you there logically

869
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
And this is where

870
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,632
Alex Clark's friend comes into play

871
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,752
There's apparently Alex Clarke was friends with somebody who decided not to get an abortion

872
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
And this makes

873
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Snik mad

874
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Somehow

875
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
You know there was a friend of Alice

876
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
We out a little bit

877
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Twitter earlier this

878
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
And she went out on Twitter she announced

879
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,368
Hey everybody I'm not aborting my baby

880
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
I know everybody was nice

881
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,512
Wow Queen brazier

882
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
I mean all the dry percent is 2

883
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Really

884
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Good enough

885
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
And let's think about this

886
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
Woman wallpaper

887
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
Why do women having

888
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Why does that happen

889
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,256
Why do abortion

890
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
They're having babies they do

891
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
You're having sex

892
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Derek

893
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
And there's a word for that there's a word for that

894
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Call Dad on cell

895
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
That's without

896
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
This is dumb

897
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Yeah this is

898
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Realtor

899
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,952
Taking the opposition to abortion and that turned it into like

900
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Opposed to people having sex

901
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
That's why unplanned pregnancies happen

902
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
We'll just be like well

903
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:17,824
Are there other things that can stop unplanned pregnancies like maybe universal access to reproductive Health Care

904
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Ida stigmatization

905
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
By way of a reproductive education

906
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
These biscuits

907
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,576
Clearly a track record that has shown that this does drastically reduce

908
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Unwanted pregnancies

909
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,952
I'm so why do we have to just have everyone stop talking

910
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah and

911
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,840
This seems like a pretty hard sell to room a teenage boy

912
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
Just say that

913
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,960
Remembering myself as teenage boy and how

914
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,520
The only thing I thought about was

915
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,128
I wonder if and when I will have sex

916
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,175
It was on my mind

917
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,783
From time to time I grew up in a bit of a Christian

918
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,671
I should tell you that I did get a promise ring and there was a I'm going to save myself for marriage

919
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,255
Thing in my in my church I grew up in Arkansas but I didn't go that far

920
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,887
I wish that I had had the restraint cuz it was a bad. Of time

921
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
I feel a little bears looking back

922
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
But

923
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,335
Found it really interesting listening to stuff like this cuz there's an anger behind Whitney

924
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Naked saying

925
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,943
And there's an anger to that women shouldn't have sex before marriage

926
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Where is

927
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
As much as I regret and I get kind of

928
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,343
Cringey feelings about myself

929
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
Looking back at my

930
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Past

931
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
I don't think there was anger

932
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
About premarital sex

933
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
I think it was a choice

934
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
That I felt I was making

935
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
And I

936
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
Didn't really care that much

937
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
About what other people were doing

938
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Except

939
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359
My friends in the church Community if they had already made the same decision as I had

940
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Yeah cuz the

941
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,735
The premise of a promise ring is kind of a personal one it is

942
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,599
The person that I end up marrying I believe deserves to

943
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Have Mecum

944
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Destin Conrad

945
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:13,791
Committed to each other or whatever is what Nick does is like

946
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
He's essentially just like

947
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,703
A woman must be clean for

948
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
It's like

949
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,103
It's one thing for people to be like oh I want to do this for my partner who do whatever

950
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
What's another thing to be like

951
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
You owe me

952
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Like that

953
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Is a little fat

954
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,319
Yeah I think also just like a even just

955
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,671
Like ballooning out a little bit umbrella looking at it

956
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
The preoccupation with

957
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
With

958
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,583
Virginity your Purity or any of that stuff is a little bit unhealthy no matter what but

959
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
The hostility in the anger

960
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
Really just

961
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Bums me out

962
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,567
Especially when there's just like is it if your problem is allegedly abortion

963
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
And your solution to it is

964
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
You know get rid of things

965
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
That lead to

966
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Premier are unplanned pregnancies

967
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
Other strategies

968
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,575
You do not have to go with

969
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
People can't have sex

970
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,927
And it alternate Leaf you zoom out just a little bit

971
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
What Nick is doing is like

972
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,559
Some friend of Alex Clark was probably like f*** you Nick

973
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Rightfully so

974
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
Probably disagree with her on everything else with her

975
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
He looked at that and said

976
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
Like oh she said

977
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
F*** you Nick

978
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,967
Krause she had sex

979
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
You know I

980
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,087
I really just don't want to borrow the language he's using

981
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
It's

982
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
It's

983
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Pretty

984
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Gross yeah

985
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,327
And I think there's also even like if we take if we take all of this

986
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
The oldest content out of it

987
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,983
You still have somebody who sees himself as like a political leader

988
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
Complaining about a fight he had on Twitter

989
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Bright

990
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
And that is sad in his gripe

991
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
They had sex right

992
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,015
And then something happened that was unexpected

993
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
And they made the decision I would want them to make

994
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
And I'm still mad about it yeah

995
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
Because it's still not good enough because

996
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
They have

997
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Okay sure

998
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Whatever

999
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,607
Nick also appears to be against contraception

1000
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
As he lays out a little bit

1001
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Ensure

1002
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
The Bible and Christian

1003
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,735
About sexuality

1004
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
That's young man and young women are

1005
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
OSHA get married and then they're only supposed

1006
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Do it with each

1007
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
What the Bible tells us about Mary

1008
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
Hookup culture

1009
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
All of that

1010
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
Unplanned pregnancy

1011
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
Where are the real

1012
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
The story

1013
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,087
Conservative values with

1014
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
Theocratic Christian

1015
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Societal organization

1016
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
Basically and even then

1017
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
I would encourage him to brush up on his Bible a little bit. There are plenty of people in God's good graces

1018
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,007
Got around Sherwood say

1019
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,919
Jesus hung out with some folks who might have been looked down upon by someone like Nick spoke out in there.

1020
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Yeah

1021
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,783
It's at you but you but yeah I like you're saying

1022
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,343
The argument here is that the GOP should

1023
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
Be the vehicle that

1024
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Yes

1025
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Which

1026
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Christian right

1027
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,143
Folks would probably agree with what is something that our government is set up at least

1028
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
On paper in theory

1029
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
Not be

1030
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
White Hope

1031
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,847
Fingers crossed I mean the rate we're going now

1032
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:16,223
I think that there's a difference between like wanting your religious beliefs to be respected

1033
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
And wanting them to be Doctrine

1034
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
To everyone

1035
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
And expected of everyone to follow

1036
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
And that is clearly what Nick is advocating for

1037
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,255
Snake is clearly advocating for

1038
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
A society where

1039
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:36,191
He's particular religious beliefs are codified into what everyone has to follow

1040
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
And that's not

1041
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
Going to be great

1042
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,383
Yeah I think for Nick and also for like people in the white nationalism that came to Generations before him

1043
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
They saw the church

1044
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:53,087
Even if the church isn't in total agreement with their agenda is kind of the fastest way to

1045
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Erase

1046
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
Or or to get

1047
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
Push the country away from the

1048
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Ideal of

1049
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
A multicultural

1050
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Percy

1051
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,119
By instituting some sort of

1052
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Theocratic

1053
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
Control

1054
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
You know

1055
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,287
Mandating the laws of the government based on a

1056
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
Religious philosophy

1057
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,687
You can get more people to not along and also have

1058
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
Like an esoteric Thing 2

1059
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
It's not

1060
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
You are not

1061
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
Accountable you are just following the rules in the good book

1062
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Right

1063
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Yeah yeah

1064
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,719
Yeah if you have like sort of a thing you can fall back on

1065
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
That's that's like wow this is fun Quest

1066
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:39,423
I want to be totally clear nothing against religion but I'm not really just what but whatever

1067
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
You know. Helps

1068
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
You do

1069
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
Did you see this as a vehicle

1070
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,639
And you know I think for anybody who's listening to the show that's like

1071
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
Play person faith is something to be conscious of

1072
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,015
The people are out there that would seek to exploit

1073
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
You are Faith

1074
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
To turn you towards something

1075
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Really nasty

1076
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,463
Sure yeah I mean like I think you see that you see that a bit nuts

1077
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,303
That's one of the things that makes some of these conversations a little bit murky

1078
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Is

1079
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
You know

1080
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
Trying to

1081
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
Discuss that without

1082
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Coming off as

1083
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
Anti-religious or anti

1084
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
Any kind of safe

1085
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,919
I think it's very possible to walk that line but people sometimes stupid jobs

1086
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,503
And I think it doesn't help that a lot of people have negative

1087
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Your past experiences of their own that they bring to the table with

1088
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
Religious communities in

1089
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
You know that that's just a challenge we all have

1090
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
It's hard to talk about it in a way that's not

1091
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,839
Is my my tan for my promise ring showing my

1092
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
My permanent

1093
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
What is it's funny cuz it's on

1094
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Houston

1095
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
Fingers how many promises did you make

1096
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
I made a lot of promises

1097
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
They've all been broken

1098
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,383
I had a pinky ring and pinky promise ring

1099
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,967
Oh I was going to have a gang

1100
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
The pinky and the boys

1101
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,087
Need to just jump out the window here

1102
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
V

1103
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,719
There was another thing that I was thinking about here to oh yeah that that's what it was

1104
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,607
There's there's another aspect of this religious stuff that Nick is bring to the table I think

1105
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
Really highlights

1106
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
A distinct difference between him

1107
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
And people like Alex

1108
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
And traditional

1109
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
Assertive anti-communist types

1110
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,407
And that is a religious zealotry and fervor on both sides

1111
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,455
But Nick is a

1112
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
Catholic fascist

1113
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
Yeah Mary specifically

1114
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
And Alex is

1115
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,367
More of a Protestant type

1116
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,439
And I think that Alex doesn't understand

1117
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,815
Yeah I don't know that he fully understands how those two

1118
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:48,191
You been historically speaking perhaps

1119
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
Yeah the extreme ends

1120
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Of

1121
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
Catholic

1122
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,615
The extremism but cyan

1123
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
More

1124
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
I don't even know what you would call him

1125
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Let me just

1126
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
Christian identity kind of his is the

1127
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
Vein you put Alex in

1128
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Yeah

1129
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
No I think that's right

1130
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Because he

1131
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
He sees it as something that he is

1132
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
And I don't

1133
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,655
Often hear Alex articulate like a really

1134
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
Coherent like

1135
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
Biblical

1136
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Argument

1137
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
Stop it's like sometimes he talks about like

1138
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Space

1139
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
In terms of God

1140
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
He's weird

1141
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,271
Yeah I think most things that he brings up about the Bible are like

1142
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Sort of out of context

1143
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,367
Quotes about like Jesus ain't get a sword and stuff

1144
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
The clown I'm not sure

1145
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
I sure would have grasped you have here

1146
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:47,327
Traditions of his community in his world in terms of religion are very different

1147
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,167
In terms of Doctrine in terms of goals

1148
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,239
Then text and I don't think that he realizes

1149
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
It went they say

1150
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,151
God or whatever they may have very distinct

1151
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
The views

1152
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
In their mind

1153
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,759
I think that's another thing that could lead to a problem

1154
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Between the two of them

1155
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
Yeah because Alex will undoubtedly

1156
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Play Fela.

1157
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Beat a stiff neck

1158
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
Decides

1159
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Wants to apply it

1160
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
Yep

1161
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Or

1162
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
Alex

1163
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,095
I mean potentially I guess could get uncomfortable by it

1164
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,935
I don't know to do things make him uncomfortable

1165
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,983
I don't know I mean like

1166
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,591
Intel Nic does something that like his lawyer thinks he needs to do something about

1167
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
I don't know if Alex would be uncomfortable

1168
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
I don't think he knows

1169
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
Like honestly I don't I don't think he knows

1170
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,783
What's goes on his own site

1171
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,343
I can't imagine that cuz I just

1172
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
He has to either not care or not

1173
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,999
Yeah and it is hard to know which

1174
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Which one of those days

1175
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,631
Things like this would be very difficult to stand behind

1176
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
Do you have Nick

1177
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,447
Saying that

1178
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,495
Abortion is wrong

1179
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
He's got the room on his side

1180
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
And therefore

1181
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Campfire

1182
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Cuz that's bad

1183
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
The only f****** marriage

1184
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
But also

1185
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
This extends much

1186
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Further

1187
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,063
It's not just about sexual

1188
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,879
Morality is not just about the family but it's also about the

1189
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
Opposition

1190
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,231
Site

1191
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,023
Who's having the babies

1192
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Does anybody know

1193
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
It's the women that are having the baby

1194
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,959
Yeah that's how that works

1195
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,775
When I say

1196
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
I don't think women should be in the

1197
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
Frankly I don't know if they should be

1198
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,415
And people say that

1199
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
How could you

1200
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
What is asinine

1201
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
50s

1202
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
The 1950s

1203
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
Soon

1204
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Just to be clear for the

1205
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,063
To the listeners at home we can talk in between some of these Cliffs but this is all from the same speech he has gone from

1206
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
I got no

1207
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
Twitter argument with Alex Clark

1208
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,207
About her friend who did the thing that I would want her to do

1209
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,255
Friend

1210
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
And then kept

1211
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
But you shouldn't have gotten pregnant the first place

1212
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,143
Because she shouldn't have been having sex

1213
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,727
By the way even with contraception spoke those things

1214
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,751
Women shouldn't vote

1215
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,895
This is spiraled out into this speech

1216
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
Cutting out parts that make it make sense

1217
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,247
This is the train of thought that he's on

1218
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,087
Is these are the things that lead to abortion

1219
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
Which it you need to be against if you work

1220
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Truly against abortion

1221
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,999
If you're truly against abortion you need to be against f******

1222
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,071
You need women not to be in the office. The workplace

1223
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
Probably shouldn't vote

1224
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
Okay

1225
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,703
We need to return to the 1950s

1226
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,519
Are the era in time

1227
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,567
It was famously good to ever

1228
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,639
Wonderful time for everyone

1229
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Everyone

1230
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
DM

1231
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
Thing is

1232
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,575
If you if you look at that train of thought

1233
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,647
What you really start to recognize is how much

1234
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
The

1235
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:31,071
Abortion has nothing to do with what he actually is advocating he's hiding behind that mantle because

1236
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Is it something that

1237
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,167
Is people will obviously get on board with

1238
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Trying to make the connection between

1239
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
Women voting

1240
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,359
Having the right to vote

1241
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,407
And being opposed to abortion

1242
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
It's a long walk

1243
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
It's a long walk

1244
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
But he gets there in like

1245
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,063
I mean what is it 60 Seconds

1246
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Give or take

1247
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,647
F****** an Olympian athlete

1248
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,951
Spell Irene in a in a

1249
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,303
Favorable ruling

1250
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,167
This makes sense outside of his own America uncanceled rally

1251
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,471
I don't know I don't know how well it would work but

1252
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,543
This is this is what he's doing he's Trojan horsing

1253
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
These other viewpoints

1254
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:19,199
On to the the artist I would I would say that they're probably inclined to

1255
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
Be angry and hostile towards women

1256
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
To begin with

1257
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:27,135
But maybe they wouldn't have gone to a rally that was a women shouldn't vote rally

1258
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,695
But they might show up for a pro-life

1259
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Rally

1260
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
Yeah I think I think that's definitely fair and it's

1261
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,839
I mean like I said it's a whole strategy

1262
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
Oh here's something you agree with

1263
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
Let me give you the real s***

1264
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Like

1265
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
And

1266
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
28

1267
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
With younger audiences and

1268
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
Apparently at the favor of

1269
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
At least one member

1270
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Congress

1271
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Like resume

1272
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Which is

1273
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:56,319
Kind of terrifying because it's we just sit here and listen to it

1274
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,623
F****** ridiculous dude it's

1275
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
It doesn't make any

1276
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,023
No and I think we're of the age where we lived through the Tea Party happen

1277
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
Right I think that

1278
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,911
In a lot of ways people didn't take that nearly seriously enough

1279
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
And I think

1280
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,495
You know you saw that

1281
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
The effect it had on

1282
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
On political discourse on

1283
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,431
Normalizing ideas that were

1284
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
Prior like I don't know about this

1285
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,063
If we're not careful

1286
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
This

1287
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,415
Could be another thing that goes that direction

1288
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,511
Like you're bringing up like the Michelle Malkin support the gosar

1289
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,303
Support

1290
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
It's

1291
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
Not nothing

1292
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Yeah and Blake

1293
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,447
These brigades from Nick

1294
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,263
His fans call themselves The groypers and staff

1295
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
The captain able to like

1296
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Kind of

1297
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Give tpusa like

1298
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,967
Enough pressure for them to bend

1299
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
Which

1300
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,343
Is a mistake to f****** begin with because once you put that

1301
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
You know you cannot put

1302
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
The toothpaste back in the tube after that

1303
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
It's like

1304
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
A boy

1305
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
You

1306
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,815
You given to the bully you play the game and

1307
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Guess who's back tomorrow

1308
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
How's the volume

1309
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,423
Yeah and that's what I feel about Alex having him on

1310
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
The the network

1311
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
Even you know like

1312
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
What you going to do

1313
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
We got to kick him off

1314
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Good luck

1315
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
Yeah I mean

1316
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
Cheese I mean we'll see

1317
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,199
It's it's a mess

1318
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,271
But you work at the little bit a little bit race

1319
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,855
No wait this is this is more just about how women need to be

1320
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
I just making babies all the time

1321
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:40,767
Alright let's do it myself I was a libertarian

1322
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
High School

1323
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,119
I never got it I don't think most people get it because

1324
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
Nobody makes you

1325
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,935
Why Nick why can't

1326
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
I love it

1327
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:55,615
Here's my favorite thing in the world when someone is like no one ever makes the argument so now I will

1328
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:01,247
I love that it's like when I was like I'm going to get down to it I'm going to prove everything

1329
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,039
Why does no

1330
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:09,439
Nobody is talking about using your toaster in the bathtub to do it right now I'm going to lay a

1331
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Get out

1332
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,839
I always always loved when someone sets the bar way too high for themselves and that's what Nick is done right here

1333
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Make the argument my man

1334
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Do you think they're incompetent

1335
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
Yes

1336
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,895
Entirely

1337
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
I mean

1338
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
But it's actually serious

1339
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:35,039
If we're to have a traditional Christian

1340
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
Sexual morality

1341
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,135
Then when is you be getting married and

1342
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Alvinblox

1343
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
That's just a natural

1344
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,839
Is your following God's word if you're real Christian a real conservative

1345
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,399
You're having all these babies

1346
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,519
Who is going to raise those babies other than their mother

1347
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,919
Yeah he's no one makes the argument so Nick's going to do it he's going to lay it out for you damn dude

1348
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:08,319
I have never heard that one before God Nick made this argument

1349
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,487
Yes women are things

1350
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,791
Women should have children

1351
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
What

1352
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,191
This guy is breaking new ground all over the place church for the first time last week

1353
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:30,847
I find I find this fascinating and I think you see it a lot with these types this

1354
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,967
Is making really really old arguments that we most people have left in the past

1355
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,527
As if they were new novel like

1356
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
Breakthroughs

1357
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
Like no one no one no one lays it out like me my religious beliefs dictate that women are acai

1358
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
Essentially just

1359
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,303
Biological machines that we use to create

1360
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
And take care of the Next Generation

1361
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,143
Yes oh wow

1362
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,423
Wow groundbreaking

1363
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
Mindfreak

1364
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Well it's just

1365
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
I mean

1366
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,079
Go back to the joke I made earlier I guess it's like

1367
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
Imagine This

1368
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Any other

1369
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,919
Contacts bright like

1370
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
So

1371
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
We used to put as best

1372
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,295
This in buildings and then people are getting sick so we stopped

1373
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
We realize that was

1374
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,159
Not how we wanted to go forward so you know we moved on

1375
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,231
And I just imagine somebody like this is the

1376
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,767
Rhetorical equivalent

1377
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Of being like

1378
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Imma let you in on a little secret

1379
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,167
There's something you can put in your walls

1380
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
I swear to God no better insulation

1381
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:37,407
Do call you an idiot say that you're going to go to the hospital when you're older if you do this

1382
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:44,575
Why would my religion dictate so you must take the risk of

1383
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Going to the hospital

1384
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Yeah it's

1385
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
It's not

1386
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
It's not convincing

1387
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,511
I would say 41

1388
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,119
And of course it does we're into racism because this is Meg

1389
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
Aperol and of course it does

1390
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
We have a country now

1391
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
Were people have babies in

1392
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
What do they do

1393
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,103
They have one or two or three kids and then they stopped

1394
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
Anime send the kids

1395
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,527
And the mom's working in the dad's working in that two cars at you car insurance at all this

1396
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,855
And they send the kids to daycare and the kids from

1397
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
The time they wake up

1398
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,183
Hi Mommy and Daddy get home from

1399
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,255
Are being raised by somebody else

1400
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Your mother

1401
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,119
They're being raised in many cases by people that don't care about them

1402
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,655
Maybe people

1403
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
You're seeing people being

1404
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,407
Mothers are too busy doing what

1405
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
Spreadsheets

1406
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,247
They're too busy making a schedule

1407
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
This is not always does have to come back

1408
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,719
Back to anti-immigrant sentiment in

1409
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,279
Encoding the are babies and

1410
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:02,143
You know it's also I think this is something that needs to be said

1411
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,191
That is the Nick is 22 years old

1412
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,007
And we know what he's been doing since he was in high school

1413
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,591
I do not know if you've somebody that I would take very seriously

1414
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,223
About what it's like to have a career or a real job

1415
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Two cars

1416
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:24,159
Little kids like damn someone figured it out cuz I don't know if I'll be able to do that

1417
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,231
Cars 2 car insurances

1418
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,839
I'm right here is what I'm saying

1419
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
But

1420
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:38,751
Yeah he's not exactly the authority on the good old days you know I just imagine him flipping through like

1421
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,799
1950s

1422
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,615
Addition of like Highlights magazine and being like

1423
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
This is what

1424
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
They stole from

1425
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:53,855
You keep Bucky's scrolled slurs in the word Bubbles and every drawing in the Highlights magazine

1426
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Yeah I know it's

1427
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
It's

1428
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,975
Ridiculous and also just this whole premise of like

1429
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
Because somebody is an immigrant

1430
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
That they would be in after

1431
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
Caring for

1432
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
A child

1433
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,239
Especially if they're in daycare they're not in school yet

1434
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
They're so young

1435
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
Remember s*** anyway like

1436
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
I mean by old despain is not probably going to stick around

1437
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:26,879
Childcare careers are often people who do not hate kids at the most selfless people in the world

1438
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
Obviously there's going to be

1439
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
Bad people in any

1440
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
Line of work but

1441
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
I would think that the people that I know who gravitated towards

1442
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Backfield

1443
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Baby love

1444
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,519
Yeah you don't do it because you get rich or you get famous it

1445
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Do it because

1446
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
UCare

1447
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,383
Are those going to be outliers in any profession

1448
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
But yeah

1449
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,759
And I think I think too. Just like Nick doesn't know what it means to have a job

1450
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,831
He doesn't know what it means to have a career and therefore he

1451
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
You can be productive

1452
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:04,511
And stupid about like all women artists making spreadsheet so they can't raise the pain

1453
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
So young

1454
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,303
2

1455
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,863
Can kind of work yeah cuz they don't know either

1456
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Yeah like if

1457
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
If they got a room full of like

1458
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
I'm thinking the tpusa donors

1459
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:21,151
Aging Q-tips roundtables eating

1460
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,943
Basil chicken

1461
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,527
Starbucks on the menu

1462
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
They just don't

1463
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:33,951
So they've got careers they've got families that got whatever but Papa and I just imagine the audience being like

1464
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
What's he talking about again

1465
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,559
I just I don't

1466
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
Think it would resonate with though

1467
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Older crowd

1468
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,495
No no because he'd been essentially be looking at them and being like all you do is make spreadsheets

1469
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,287
And everyone who's

1470
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,847
Had a career or done work

1471
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,663
Knows that there's much more

1472
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,991
To having a career especially something that you love

1473
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,807
Something that you find fulfilling something that is like

1474
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
A part of your life

1475
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:08,511
The idea of depriving people of that because you and your religious beliefs dictate that they must have babies constantly

1476
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
Is this is bizarre

1477
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
It's

1478
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
Unhinged

1479
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
It's

1480
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,751
Supremacist is what it is it's true

1481
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
That my beliefs

1482
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
So much

1483
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
More important than you was

1484
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
The person that they should take

1485
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Dictate your life

1486
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
Yep Anza

1487
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:34,623
It's now something that Alex apparently is either tacitly or explicitly condone

1488
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Yeah

1489
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:44,351
We have one more because it's basically just him being like well if this is sexist then I

1490
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
I guess I am

1491
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah yeah I would agree

1492
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,287
The best point he's made the whole speech accept the mantle kind of

1493
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,663
Rhetorically what he's trying to do is be like this isn't exit this is just

1494
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Normal

1495
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
And it's not

1496
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
This is this is outrageous

1497
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,367
I've said this before in a AAA think it Bears repeating

1498
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
I don't think that I would

1499
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
Spend time covering

1500
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Hypnic

1501
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
I'm glad the people like you do

1502
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
Because I think that

1503
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,119
He's somebody that definitely people should pay attention to

1504
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
And deserves

1505
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
A critical eye

1506
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
But I don't know how much he fits into the scheme of

1507
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Of what we cover on this show

1508
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
But

1509
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:30,431
He's on Alex's network doing this now

1510
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,527
This is so incompatible with the message that Alex

1511
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,343
Tries to sell his brand on

1512
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
But I think

1513
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,415
It bears like

1514
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
Looking at being like

1515
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Really

1516
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,279
This is now this is now in Fort Worth

1517
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
This is

1518
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
This is their their contact

1519
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,911
Yeah I mean it's it's certainly interesting but it's

1520
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:56,543
Yeah I mean at the end of the day I think they're kind of onto different tracks

1521
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,639
And there's some overlap there

1522
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,407
But

1523
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
When the rubber hits the road I just

1524
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
Yeah it is kind of hard to

1525
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
To wrap your head around it

1526
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,879
I think that they are fortunate that the rubber has not hit the road

1527
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,927
And I imagine what it does

1528
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,999
They will turn on each other

1529
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
Incredibly aggressive

1530
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
I hope so that would be

1531
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,679
It is somebody who has had to spend countless hours of my life

1532
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,239
Both paying attention to Alex and Nick watching them

1533
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
Each other alive would be

1534
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Immensely

1535
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,431
Personally entertaining to me I think there would be some schadenfreude

1536
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
For sure

1537
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,039
I would worry about how he could have the at like it could

1538
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,111
Accelerate things for some of their followers

1539
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
Yet if one wins the others audio

1540
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,207
That's a bad thing

1541
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,815
Yeah it would be it would be interested to see them take potshots

1542
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
Especially because like

1543
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
A lot of the stuff like

1544
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,215
That's a bit Nikki use it as ammunition against people that he

1545
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,495
Goes after

1546
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,799
Are all the criticisms

1547
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,615
The people in the right-wing have had of Alex

1548
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,687
They all constantly said that he's a shill for Israel

1549
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,735
They say that he works for Mossad

1550
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
All of this is a tradition

1551
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,599
That they could pull from

1552
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
I'm just

1553
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,439
Go to town against Alex what's something that Nick does for like

1554
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Everybody

1555
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
It almost feels like he's pulling a punch

1556
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
Without

1557
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Yeah

1558
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Let me just take me for

1559
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,959
Right because I was on the first people that started writing about him

1560
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
And now the people have questions about

1561
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
People call me in like he has

1562
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,383
Hold on let me just send you a document you

1563
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,735
Off and on the record he talks you check all this s*** out

1564
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
And you tell me what you think of

1565
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
But I

1566
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,647
Yeah it's pretty obvious what he's doing he said

1567
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
It is failed with

1568
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
8

1569
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,231
Next

1570
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
See straight through it but

1571
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
So he doesn't like me

1572
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
So when I was at Breitling watch

1573
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
I was the Soros

1574
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
You know I was working at Jewish

1575
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Oh yeah

1576
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
And dumb

1577
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
Now I work at the FR lab which is

1578
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,687
Connect to the Atlantic council's and I work for NATO and now

1579
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
I'm CIA and

1580
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:16,063
What is the CIA but an extension of Mossad and

1581
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
He always takes it back

1582
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Having some

1583
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Problem with you

1584
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,791
8888 a very constant refrain on his part

1585
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,399
And expect some of that in the future Alex

1586
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,751

Listening to Nick Fuentes ever is really

1590

You're somebody who has been really supportive over the course of

Is important and you guys understand

1606
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
Like a lot of media especially National media will

1607
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Baby

1608
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,095
Go to Infowars Argota

1609
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863

1610
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Angela

1611

Mine

1612
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Detective

1613
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,031
Origin tank 11 of like this is this particular crazy thing he

1614
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Tea set

1615
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:44,127
But there aren't a whole lot of people just really like

1616
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
Sitting with

1617
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
And like

1618
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
Watching the show Kansas

1619
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,319
And you're really getting a feel for like the Infowars cast of characters

1620
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,439
Sort of how the show works I can tell you why that is

1621
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:00,511
I think you know why cuz you used to do that a lot

1622
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
No

1623
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,375
It's not a fun job

1624
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
But it's

1625
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
It's

1626
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
Unfortunately Imports

Widely revered potato the most popular
