00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
Alex Jones

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
When was the last time

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,928
Aquarium Museum

5
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
I want to Shedd Aquarium

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,536
Downtown

7
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,424
Surprising number of

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
DigiTech

9
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,880
I have like a

10
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
Do cats like humans in 23 years

11
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
The end of the whole thing was

12
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Was kind of implying

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,168
Are we going to be a part of this one

14
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
What was the diversity of the said even if climate change

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Achilles the fact that were destroying all of the species of the world means

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:29,600
Biodiversity assessment is really just

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,976
Because I know

18
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,096
Never been smoother

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,984
The show

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
To the wacky wacky world

21
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432

And that is a whole lot

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
So we want to give you guys a little

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
A little reprieve from chocolate

26
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
The wonderful world of Project Camelot where Kerry Cassidy

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
Investigative reporter

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
6.

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
How about their time in space

30
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Perfect show format

31
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
It really is

32
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Is it

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Until you get erased

34
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
It's kind of

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Ill-advised

36
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,576
I'd like to take a little moment

37
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
2

38
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Somebody who

39
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
Has

40
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Appreciate

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Tamale

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
You are now

43
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Ewok

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Sports over on knowledge fight.com

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152

48
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064

49
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,136
It's mollywobbles sower

50
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
Default maybe last initial sometimes

51
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
I think people would prefer you left their names out of it and just

52
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Said they're at

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,944
Just came up with fun

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,808
Great nickname

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
My social security number is my day

56
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,744
Play what we've got is an episode where the title of

57
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Is

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Secret space program recruits

59
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Okay I'll write I'll write down with a couple of dudes

60
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,848
And the other guy I believe is Tony Rodriguez

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
All right there

62
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
May or may not be super soul

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,392
So exciting the lead actors in a reboot of chips

64
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
That's all I'm saying

65
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
But here is an out-of-context drop

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
290 you have

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Started out as a

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
Illuminati sex slave

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
I would say that's a tough like entry level position

70
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
Possible for any

71
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
2toni

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
Different stories

73
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Space together

74
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
Or anything like that

75
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Their story which

76
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,335
Together and I believe they met each other through some internet forum

77
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Amanda

78
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
I'm 40 I'm all about French

79
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
Here is Kerry Cassidy

80
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Beginning the interview

81
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Starting it out

82
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,767
Hi everyone I'm Terry Cassidy from Project Camelot and I am

83
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535

84
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
With two very

85
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Resting individual

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
And we're going to be talking about

87
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
The secret space

88
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Program Mars

89
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Variances that

90
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
I have been having

91
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
In their past and I'm not sure whether there is

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
It's on going or not

93
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Where to find that out

94
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
So we're just

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Calling them Secret

96
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Space Program

97
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Fruits

98
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159

Sadra

101
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Why don't you have a designation

102
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
I don't know but isn't Alex

103
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
SSRI

104
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Supersize program-record opportunist

105
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,967
Hallucinogenic

106
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
I think that these people might be suffering for

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
So I feel like it

108
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Years that carry Castle

109
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
He's been doing this

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,511
Whatever level Veyron

00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,375

That's important

123
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Is it an issue

124
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09,823
Remember that I've been spoiled

125
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663

Also it's a it's good I'm still learning about his for a happy to be here and continue

133
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
I believe that to the internet message board

00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
Right right right

135
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
Time to each other

136
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,487
We got hooked up together by the

137
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Alright man

138
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
You talk to a tree

139
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
I would say that this interview is

140
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Probably like

141
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
It starts out real

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
And then

143
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Disappoints

144
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
For a bit and then gets

145
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Alright

146
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
Someone like Eddie page

147
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
Whenever we have those people and it's kind of like things just

148
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,207
Keep Calm this is ridiculous

149
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
It is like a

150
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Drab adult

151
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
No-nonsense kind of

152
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
He has a real boring voice

153
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
So he's coming in with like

154
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Retainment Valley

155
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
That you would help from

156
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Space weird

157
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
But like I said

158
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,391
Responsible

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
He wasn't Tony

160
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
A butt

161
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
I told you this starts out hot

162
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
And here is the

163
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Where Carrie starts reading their bios

164
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Is dope ROM

165
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
So it looks like

166
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Befriended

167
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Human

168
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
Appearing visitor name

169
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
How do you say the sign

170
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
Send my love lyrics

171
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Cultures and people

172
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
This friendship

173
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Saltillo lawyer witches

174
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Artist

175
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,519
This doesn't come back up at all

176
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,895
Vienna the agent doesn't it secondly doesn't come back up there

177
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
That is why he is an escape artist no idea what that I would have loved to know

178
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
But

179
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
It goes on

180
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Jimmy Church

181
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
His show you will have heard some of that

182
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,935
He got involved in an

183
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Cherry my lab

184
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Situation

185
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
And he was in

186
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Identified as an intuitive empath

187
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Corsage

188
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Experimental Behavior

189
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Daddy's

190
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223

191
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527

00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Last year my lap

1977 this guy would have been

197
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Under 10 years

198
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
The 1970s

199
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
So

200
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Just consider that

201
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
And

202
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Most of his

203
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Time in Act

He was involved in Atlanta and I'm going to

206
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Kind of skim through this

207
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
That's a little rude

208
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Okay so Tony

209
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
You just choose drugs over to Tony.

210
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
This guy was friends with an alien

211
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Bus station I guess that is kind of blase

212
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383

213
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,527

221
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
The worst way to confusing possible

222
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
From

223
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
A name I can't pronounce Michigan

00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Normal is

227
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Kind of

228
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
? there

229
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,103
Human I think you're calling yourself sort of a Slave

231
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Our sex slave

232
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,503
Satanic worshiping and

233
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
I'm assuming this wasn't your with your

234
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Your permission

235
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
We need to start getting into the Dom sub relay

236
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,095

00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Find that out

238
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
And I later sold off to seek

239
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
He served on Mars

240
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Sportster

241
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Support Soldier

242
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Search for the model waiter

243
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Look up directly from sex slave to Soldier

244
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Involved in this

245
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Series colony

246
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Where he lived

247
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Over a decade

248
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
And was working on German

249
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Sepsis

250
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
Repairman and eventually and cargo engineer on it

251
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Betrayed me

252
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
Sleep now part of his story is that they are able to

253
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,215
The digitally trained

254
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Things to do that

255
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,871
It's terribly like I just downloaded Kung Fu For Me main issue

256
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
If you just

257
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Like the people the Illuminati

258
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Who owned him

259
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
We'll learn a little bit more

260
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
Gave up his papers like they they sold them off

261
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Because it was in a

262
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Particularly boring

263
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,679
Stretch of the show but I believe

264
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Stuff like that

265
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Do a different drug

266
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
Who drugged them and he was allergic to that drugs

267
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
I believe that that is how he

268
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
That is the most reasonable explanation I've ever heard on

269
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
He's not terrible at war game like he is pretty pieces at like

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,327
Alright that's alright also

271
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,935
Cut through any of this conspiracy bullshitted not like

272
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,455
Right rice

273
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,063
I wasn't saved by anybody I was allergic to this new drug

274
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Bummer it it's like recommendation whatever I became a soldier that if you're already in for a penny

275
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,143
That'll help you get in for a pound

276
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Do you have decent Prop Shops

277
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Storyteller

278
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
So in this

279
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,103
Next

280
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
You got to gold

281
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Secret space program

282
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
You can hear it there that he worked on the Mars colony Corporation

283
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,135
Event ended up in the series Colony Corporation

284
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
That's because people like him

285
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Acute sinusitis

286
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Kerry Cassidy's whistleblower

287
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
They're very big into the idea that these are corporate in

288
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
Interlake businesses

289
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,591
Sure

290
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
There's something

291
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
William Shakespeare

292
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Can I listen to this

293
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Twice and missed it both times

294
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
But I'm so glad that I

295
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
This is something that I think is the Pinnacle of ludicrous

296
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Okay but I will get there as we

297
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
For now we have to find out

298
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
How did Tony

299
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
End up getting into

300
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
This whole thing

301
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Situation because

302
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
I don't think you sign up

303
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
To be an Illuminati sex slave

304
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
I think that's a situation probably

305
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,039
You're not you're not thrilled with the situation

306
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
And then they

307
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
I don't know right

308
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Makeup for the steak tips

309
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Mysterious Corporation Fallout

310
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Entirely possible

311
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
If we find out the

312
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Not something

313
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
You found on

314
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
I don't know

315
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
ZipRecruiter

316
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,759
Something like that

317
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:59,391
I also don't think they would like be implying that Illuminati sex slave openings

318
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,023
Do you want me to text late check-out ziprecruiter.com

319
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Well I didn't go through

320
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
I wasn't groom

321
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
For the space program

322
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
I was I was kind of more of a victim of it like

323
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
In early years I made somebody mad that had Acts

324
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
They put me in that

325
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
In that program

326
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
The score and back

327
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Or whatever Arie want to call it whatever we call it nowadays

328
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Where I was taken at night

329
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,343
Did 20 years and put back and during that time I was

330
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Though it was done as a punishment

331
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
It wasn't because I was

332
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
The best man for the job

333
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Somites

334
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,351
Did my particular situation is much different than other people you've heard in that regard

335
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
But why me and Jason are working together as what I found is that

336
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
You know

337
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
Since I've done my first I've done over 40 interviews now

338
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
And since the first ones with dr. Stella

339
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
People have reached out to

340
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,735
Most people don't remember as much and people that remember quite a bit don't want to talk about it

341
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
What I found is that the absolute best therapy

342
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
Speak to other people that experience it into me and Jason have been

343
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Able to do that

344
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,583
I can respect that little

345
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,959
Right right you had access to the secret space program

346
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Well and you and then open the next

347
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
20 years of sex life

348
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
It's also kind of important to consider that he's 46 years old

349
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
And he will later say that is able to 1982

350
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,831
So you was married for 46 years on top of that you would have to invent

351
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,927
This happened so he pissed off someone in the secret space program

352
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
World for 20 years

353
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
And then put back into his body the exact so

354
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,519
This is all

355
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
Birdnow this is all metaphysics

356
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
No it actually happened

357
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
Who cares it's the same thing with it

358
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,367
We'll get into it with when we heard that interview with Randy Cramer

359
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
He had the same

360
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,463
Situation

361
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
I believe his version of it was

362
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
He got cloned or something like that

363
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
They made a younger clone

364
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
To put back

365
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Into

366
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Who cares

367
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
It's all nonsense

368
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
I promise

369
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
I promise you

370
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Everything okay

371
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
So a little bit more

372
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
Seeing them come back door Escape artistry

373
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
It should so we learn here more of the back

374
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
In this clip

375
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
It's only a minute

376
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
But he drops a couple of bombshell p

377
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Formation

378
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
The carry does not follow up on

379
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Until later in the

380
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
Play the program that I was apart of

381
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Called

382
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
And it's actually

383
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Was

384
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
Earth providing 24000

385
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
24000 G forces

386
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Or used by the

387
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
German Breakaway civilization

388
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Initially

389
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
It was going to be used for Border Patrol

390
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
What it was

391
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
I'm worried about it too

392
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
What is a Volkswagen

393
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Which we were helping

394
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Their planet

395
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
There aren't enough of us

396
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
To fight for them

397
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
So our mission was

398
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
To help train

399
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Build up their defenses

400
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Help them to

401
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
Create their own opinion

402
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
And I

403
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
The 20 years that I

404
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
I spent in that program

405
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
I made it

406
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Through the rank of major

407
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
So they always

408
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,799
First of all bars Germany something that should set off alarm

409
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
I believe

410
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
Learn by the time we have not

411
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
That is unfortunate

412
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
I already assumed pleasure

413
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
In space

414
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:22,816
But the other part is when I

415
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Hear that

416
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Cliff

417
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
I can't not think about the Iraq

418
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
You know

419
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Feel like that

420
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
Entirely a poetic way of describing what happened

421
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Iraq

422
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Because if you want to talk about false Flags

423
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Some things like that everyone

424
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,296
911

425
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Involvement in Iraq

426
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Actor gets.

427
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
That that sort of

428
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
So

429
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
That's there

430
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
Him being like

431
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:56,096
We weren't there to fight we were there to try and train these

432
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
These martians or alien

433
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
In order to figure out

434
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Border

435
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,336
Border control

436
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
I we were trying to make it so a raccoon

437
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
Did sell all like here is a

438
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,064
Bentley veiled metaphor for our failed foreign policy

439
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Over the last

440
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Decade

441
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
We don't need the

442
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
Iraq

443
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
Enough for you for everybody to be like

444
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Evil off of

445
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Literally like

446
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,384
Did you hear that George W bush got

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
F****** metal metal

448
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
I'm not going to say anything other than that man should be prosecuted for war crimes Under The Hague

449
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
You shouldn't get a battle

450
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
Right right

451
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Beer minimum

452
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,168
Could you set a building on fire and then you put out the fire at

453
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Did you get an award for

454
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
For putting out the fire

455
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
Gametal

456
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Self

457
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
He was there for 20

458
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
I work with

459
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
German

460
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Of course he gets back

461
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Just minutes after

462
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Have you had

463
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
My term of service in IDOC was

464
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
I'd argue over

465
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:50,016
20 years

466
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,184
The worst Mac products

467
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,280
Stanford electric rollers

468
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
Defense in Readiness for since I believe is what I dark stands for

469
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
Secret space program

470
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
Better than I do

471
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Okay but in real time

472
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Were you gone for like

473
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Longer. Of time

474
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
How does how does that work in Earth years

475
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,768
Workout

476
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Equal time

477
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Was 20 years into months

478
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
But my reinsertion back

479
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
To the initial departure point

480
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Happened

481
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
Within a couple of hours of my

482
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Receiving my change of water

483
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Why

484
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Okay so

485
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
Will the royal couple of hours

486
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Because they

487
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
Can be explained by a night sleep or something like that a couple hours

488
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
This is very easy for you to be like

489
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,232
That's the amount of times that I wasn't here no one would have noticed if it was overnight

490
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
Keep notice if you were gone for

491
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
This is important because a couple of within a couple of hours

492
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
20 minutes

493
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Totally

494
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
You're preaching to the choir

495
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
I empathize with your complaint

496
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
I don't have an answer for that but there must be a Sikh

497
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
I don't know

498
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
There's got to be some sort of like you do they still have to do the paperwork on Earth

499
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,120
Or something like that I don't know

500
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
If I understand

501
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Maybe because

502
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
A Time paradox

503
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Or two of you exist

504
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,408
Who knows with these people because they need their to

505
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
To be like

506
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
Oh there's proof but

507
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
Oh yeah I was gone for a couple hours you can ask my parents

508
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
Was gone for no time at all but then you have

509
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
24-hours of

510
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,960
Baby baby

511
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
They don't even have

512
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
A couple hours

513
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Another attempt on Jason fart

514
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
To imply that there was hard evidence

515
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Anymore

516
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Enhancements that we received

517
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
Where nanites

518
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
And course

519
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Ring from

520
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
My system

521
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
All of the insurance that I had during the day

522
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
We're going

523
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
So

524
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,912
Any of the

525
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Sorry but you say nanites

526
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
You're talking about Nana

527
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,872
Rihanna right now. Cantrell's everything on

528
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Planets

529
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Actually clear.

530
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Completely because

531
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Cuz we've all got it

532
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,088
You have a second

533
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,488
Do any of the other nanite

534
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
Others present in the atmosphere

535
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,008
So super soldier enhancement

536
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Consistent

537
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
So that way

538
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
White wine

539
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,200
When did they flush them all of it is out of his

540
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
A couple hours after he left

541
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,672
I thought cuz I saw

542
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Yeah he was like

543
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:47,840
Mentally taking away I don't think so I think that was another physical

544
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
I think all of them

545
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,824
I don't know what I look like

546
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
Physical kidnapping

547
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,432
Just taking someone's consciousness

548
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Is my

549
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,344
Interpretation their bodies going

550
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Grabs him

551
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,976
Put a man in space

552
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,864
Work with space not

553
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
They aren't even the ones

554
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Trading or helping

555
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Space docking

556
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Boonton German

557
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Bars German

558
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
The thing is I understand it is they

559
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
They physically take the person away

560
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
What's the problem

561
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
The consciousness

562
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Out of the person and put it in a 10 year old

563
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Clone

564
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
Of the the person and then puts back

565
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:58,752
Alright repressed the memory

566
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
If you can transfer Consciousness you could wipe

567
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Remember never remember

568
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
Ecology is like

569
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,552
There's no reason for them to not improve it to the point where these people can't remember

570
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Furthermore

571
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
Number one point of order

572
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Alright

573
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,024
This is a shadowy group of interstellar traveling Space Nazis

574
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
They can handle all kinds of s*** that are abducting children

575
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,704
Spending and sending them to act slaves or soldiers

576
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Respectively

577
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Caleb

578
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
You wouldn't spend all of your time and money like rebuilding them and putting them back into a different bottle now.

579
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,088
Contra

580
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
You're totally right

581
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
Yeah cuz people just

582
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
If you were a child but it does happen the kids disappear

583
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Fear from their homes

584
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
In the middle of the night from home

585
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,776
Elizabeth Smart taken from her house

586
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,616
Maybe

587
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,040
Listen through your windows device

588
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
So like let's say

589
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
Jason

590
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
In the middle of the night

591
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Secret space program takes him up

592
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Tomorrow's to

593
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
To be a major or something

594
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
Do they bring him back makes no sense I ground it wouldn't cause any

595
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
There is a fundamental problem with the way these Moon Nazis do business

596
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:46,272
If you're going to steal somebody abduct them and put them put them to work for you for 20 years

597
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,344
It is an implicit agreement that politeness

598
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Dictate

599
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
You bring them back

600
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Resume to that

601
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
Leave it better than when you found it

602
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Sure get rid of all those

603
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
Also true of the camp

604
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
Consciousness

605
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Put it in a 10 year old

606
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
Clone body they wouldn't have the nanites

607
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Where in the body

608
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
You like displacing

609
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
The consciousness

610
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Back

611
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
This makes no sense

612
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:16,992
I guess what the event is like

613
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
It's not that they put the country

614
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
Is it a clone date

615
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,488
David machine that makes you a ten-year-old again

616
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
I don't know Space Nuts

617
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Very

618
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
Contradicting position

619
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,472
From Jason

620
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
For a little bit

621
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,664
He has a little bit more than him

622
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
And then this is

623
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
He's got everything going on

624
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Investment Club

625
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Do you think you did

626
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Everything

627
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Basically it was a 20-year

628
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Turn

629
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
That I was taken

630
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
In the beginning I wasn't

631
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
Play service

632
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Seems I was privately owned

633
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,728
And I went through a program CIA remote viewing program

634
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Where we were

635
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Classified as clones

636
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
So I can't work like that intuitive work

637
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:22,272
And I ended up living in Puerto tahuantinsuyo Peru and

638
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,600
He was a psychic that they were drugging

639
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
They could put me under and I was

640
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Being used as a

641
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
Security measure for an airplane that shipped cocaine

642
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
From portal tahuantinsuyo to Santa Marta Colombia

643
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,984
Can you could you could you give me all of the details

644
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
Using psychic involved in Iran Contra

645
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
I would like all of the details there

646
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Harry does not ask any

647
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
What

648
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
For the CIA which makes them

649
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
Bridge

650
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Sure

651
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Maybe

652
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
I don't know

653
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
How could you know

654
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,168
You would never actually not

655
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,008
And he knew that clones existed and he was being drugged during all this time

656
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
Any was classified as a

657
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
But you yourself are the clone a real person who died or was

658
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Seems to

659
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
Used to be that he is certain

660
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
The Clones

661
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
That part

662
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,696
Check that box Roy the theory or the end of this clip

663
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Just wait one second

664
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Sorry you called yourself

665
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
Was that a purpose

666
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
Explorers Den

667
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,704
But I think it was a misunderstanding but the doctors that worked on me

668
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
How could you know

669
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
That put me through that program which I trace back through project bro

670
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
The CIA

671
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Considered me a clone

672
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:59,040
So I don't know if they were told that so that they they were disconnected from us but

673
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
The more I look at it adds up

674
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
Has more than one second

675
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
They can do what I think there's many different

676
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
I've got a few

677
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Did the same as earlier

678
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Medication

679
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
So they sold me off

680
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
That's alright cool dude

681
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
Dehumanized me like

682
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:48,448
Love that! Feel like they were f******

683
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
I loved it

684
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
I love that explanation as to why I am once again on his side

685
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Good enough

686
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Good enough

687
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Also

688
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Because they do

689
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
You want to hear it

690
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
From the other horse

691
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Were you taking off

692
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
A few hours that amounted

693
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
220 years or

694
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
How would you clap tinoco

695
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,608
I was taken at night after we went to bed I had a

696
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,192
We have the UFO experience I have greys and reptiles

697
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
Open my bedroom that carried me off

698
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
Makeup me back this very same night and I woke up and had breakfast

699
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,640
My family's next morning

700
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,504
Okay what year was that that you lived those 20

701
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
In my rutinel interviews

702
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672
School year of 81 but I thought 81 but

703
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
Good morning look back on it it was

704
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
It was around April of 82 that I was

705
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Fourth grade

706
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Liar

707
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
Disney Original interviews

708
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,520
He said it's 81 now it's 82

709
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
Because I look back on my life

710
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
Is a little bit of

711
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
I might I might be a little bit wrong about some

712
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,856
I think that's normal if your Maybe

713
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,256
Spell I can't argue that although it seems like

714
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,352
Massively traumatic events like being kidnapped by aliens

715
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
Here's another issue

716
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Entrained

717
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Remote viewer

718
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
You should be able to put his brain

719
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
The past in

720
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Baby tooth pain

721
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
I

722
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,944
I don't want to I don't want to ask him to open up old doors

723
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Evenflo sleeping

724
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,160
How am I able to do the remote

725
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,024
The natural York

726
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,352
Having a vivid dream

727
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
Is it going to be responsible

728
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
For some

729
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
It's not a

730
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Does Gear in

731
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Next clip

732
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Tony playing

733
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Precipitate

734
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
He's coming out

735
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
I'm talking about being

736
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Being a secret Soldier

737
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
When I came back

738
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
And I had my memories back on my lights off

739
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
It certainly seems logical that I was taken

740
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
But whatever my Sparkle icon

741
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Taken out of 1

742
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,768
And put into another blank slated body and then

743
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
Put back and so that way those ears weren't remembered so

744
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
After the 20 years

745
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Brief memory

746
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,544
But after the 20 right after the 20-year Mark right after

747
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
No 2000

748
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Then I had an MRI done

749
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
And that's what triggered the memory

750
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Also at the same time with one eye

751
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
I discovered Randy Kramer's first interview status

752
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Find ballet

753
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
In the same night and I think that's when it all

754
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
I was in denial of everything

755
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
I remembered I was in

756
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Complete denial

757
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
When could I have had time

758
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
Understand it look out the window the Starship over the planet Ceres

759
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
And look at look down when could I have done that I

760
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
I had chronological memory of my whole entire life

761
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Maybe when you're asleep

762
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
Time to like stand out on the bridge

763
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
But like you hear their man

764
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,464
I had all this stuff they came to him as I call it all makes sense

765
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
Now that I've heard Randy Cramer tell.

766
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
Exact same story

767
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
On Project Camelot

768
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
This is like

769
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
This is a clone

770
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,288
Generational super soldier stories

771
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
All the Project Camelot

772
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Is

773
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
It certainly seems logical

774
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,504
Favorite favorite

775
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
They removed my Consciousness and put it into a younger body

776
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,792
Spell Occam's razor

777
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
Yeah it's a little it's a little much

778
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
It's actually called Mac has raised

779
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
Will you learn a little bit more about Mars German

780
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Iran

781
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
I know we've already talked

782
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
It is bad news

783
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,016
It is that is that the worst thing that you can say about Mars Germans they're very clean.

784
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
News

785
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Is not good for

786
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
German

787
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Series colony was a German break

788
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
German Breakaway collar

789
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
You knew there were German

790
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
Because why

791
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
Expensive

792
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
And there were everywhere you with every every

793
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,872
Where you at there was an eagle with a different symbol under it

794
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
In some places

795
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
Yes

796
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Places that happen.

797
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Western Society ran

798
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
Was it run

799
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Call Sasha

800
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
The fastest colony

801
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm series

802
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Yes

803
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
It was a military it was ran by the military

804
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
But they were German

805
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes and they reported to the Antarctica

806
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
G Series and had absolute power there but they reported to the high command on Antarctica and I believe that the high command on Antarctica

807
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Reported to

808
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Reptilians

809
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
I believe that

810
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Bobo's

811
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
What about Dimas

812
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
I'm not familiar with any operations out Bobo

813
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,312
Project Camelot

814
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
There is that line

815
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
Except

816
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Are we were all like

817
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,344
Chicago it turns out that that's a reference to 2010

818
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
The sequel to 2001 Space Odyssey I didn't realize that

819
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,144
Call went over my head I completely thought that she was

820
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
Saying something about like

821
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:17,824
Information not looking for the movie

822
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Yeah who cares

823
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
So the other thing

824
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
I want to know what's going on in Phobos

825
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Remember find out

826
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
How do we not find out

827
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,744
We do know is that serious is rotten

828
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Bars

829
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,120
German German

830
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
They speak German and have Nazi regalia

831
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
Do you know who else I would describe

832
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Like 10% of America

833
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Spiritual

834
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Most of them are you Linda

835
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,319
You know they're run by

836
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
To Antarctica

837
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Which means

838
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
This guy believes in Halloween

839
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,607
Because that's where it's stuff is that there are underground not going right

840
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:19,007
New Berlin

841
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,823
Center of the Earth

842
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Informed

843
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Just like that

844
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,199
So he believes in followers but also apparently this is news to me

845
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,015
The Antarctica Nazis report

846
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
2

847
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Reptilian

848
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Outside

849
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Which is exciting

850
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,695
He also says that he's never seen a reptilian

851
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
That they're in the mix

852
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
Okay

853
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,375
Which is way more than if he was like

854
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Yeah

855
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Yeah it is

856
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Difficult

857
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
But it is

858
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,151
Expect from an outright conference

859
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,735
Describing

860
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,319
Vivid hallucinations are dreams

861
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
That stuff like that

862
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,695
Sounds to me like there's some sort of trauma

863
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
That he is

864
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Dealing with

865
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Subway

866
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:18,143
Anything I can't do what it is but it seems like this

867
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
If this story is like

868
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Not a

869
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,031
Not a lie. I'm trying to get something out of somebody

870
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
This is one of our classic

871
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Project Camelot episodes where it's like

872
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Something went down

873
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
Maybe make

874
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,831
Entirely possible

875
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
Convince the necessarily that is

876
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
Because he's not really like

877
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
There's a lack of emotion behind it there's not like he doesn't

878
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
Like really troubled by any of the stuff

879
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
Lytic is equally likely that he saw a bunch of

880
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,983
Movies the baby he was too young to see when he was a kid

881
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
Vivid dreams

882
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
He had some sort of like

883
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
Begotten

884
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
The drugs a little bit late

885
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,919
Riviera bad drip

886
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
Or something like that

887
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Conspiracy

888
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
Any of these things are possible that would plant

889
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
Later to hear

890
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
Cramer's interview and be like

891
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
That explains everything

892
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
This mythology

893
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
G about himself dating back

894
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
When he was 10

895
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,191
Stuff is possible

896
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
Stuff like the guy in

897
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Vietnam

898
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Who was fighting beetle beings

899
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
That's a different animals in

900
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
Tamia still like we're cool

901
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,623
Possible

902
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,535
You're unfair to suggest

903
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Possibility

904
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
But we have no idea of knowing

905
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,239
So

906
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
It still feels

907
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
Far more real his responses are

908
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,711
Because in between all of the Corn Flakes

909
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Did the sense that I get from listen

910
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
You someone who actually

911
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
We asked like

912
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,879
What's the problem with this idea

913
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Critique of my

914
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
My narrative

915
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
I was allergic to medication that's why I

916
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
I would like to know what

917
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Other

918
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,167
Medication tickets

919
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:33,567
Medical history search

920
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,711
An allergy panel with me if you got

921
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,063
What's the weather

922
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Scripture

923
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
All these damn spiders that look like humans

924
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
Keith what are jobs at the borders

925
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Jordan

926
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,239
He was deeply involved

927
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
Control structure

928
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
The

929
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Mars

930
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
German

931
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Were in

932
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,687
Play

933
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,063
The Jason also had

934
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
F****** everywhere he has

935
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
The f******

936
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,207
Funniest take on this

937
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,511
His explanation for their speaker

938
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
German is so fun

939
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
How did you know they were Germans

940
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Speak German

941
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
That's great question

942
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
I knew there were Germans because the other

943
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
Officers that I first

944
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Counters at work from our Sherman

945
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
Self identify themselves

946
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Farfegnugen

947
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,367
The German word for something that was reserved

948
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Leadership

949
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
German military

950
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
Soldiers

951
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
Knew how to speak German than that was

952
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
What

953
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Bay Resort

954
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,543
Which specifically so that they had it means

955
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,359
Communicate among their own citizen

956
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,687
Without others being able to determine what was that they were saying

957
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,479
But here's a problem with that

958
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,503
Germanism

959
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
It's really not hard

960
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,647
Germanic language

961
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:29,535
Could pick up fairly easily if you're not

962
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Space

963
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,887
Like there's a high school

964
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,239
If you are these soldiers that are up there all of them were taken out of their beds at 10

965
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,687
Conceivably some of these people would just have to know German

966
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
German family

967
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Super easy to

968
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Pickup

969
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,439
Languages that are very closely connected to English

970
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
Now what they could do

971
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Is a space like words

972
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
You know what

973
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,447
Female but I think it's you I think that's unreasonable

974
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
Q

975
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,687
Sweet Creek community Mars German

976
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,807
They hold strong

977
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
Sure

978
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,463
Maintaining a connection to the waterline

979
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
Sorry

980
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
Now what I would suggest that's true

981
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
But it was

982
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
You know you can invent a language

983
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,503
Like Esperanto

984
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
I don't remember any of it

985
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
To understand

986
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
I can't remember much of it

987
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
Much like these guys have memories of space

988
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
I have memories of being like a

989
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
The ten-year-old boys

990
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Like speaking

991
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,407
Germans teacher do pigeons experiment

992
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,599
I would say that if your plan is to make it so that there's a language that no one else

993
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Understand

994
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,159
There's a very easy way to do that

995
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Make your own socket

996
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
Don't use German

997
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Germany is

998
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
That is

999
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
A good

1000
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
I take that as a good point

1001
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,495
However I do think that it undermines their goal of using turmeric

1002
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Because like I said it's too easy

1003
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:53,151
Key I don't

1004
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,039
For real I mean I didn't get that they were doing it as anything other than like an

1005
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Exclusive

1006
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
Think we're only the only the officers

1007
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
Are allowed to communicate in German

1008
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,023
Not because they don't want other people to understand so much but because

1009
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
It gives them a sense of class

1010
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
He said that the

1011
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
If you learn German if you know German it gets turned off I don't know what that means

1012
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,639
They turned off the positive what's going on with

1013
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
There's f******

1014
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
If someone's talking in German

1015
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,143
Plenty of there's so many of those

1016
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
30 Mars German

1017
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
They don't respect their planning

1018
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,639
Whatever I don't know

1019
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,967
Sooner or later you're going to

1020
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:06,367
I think their Authority goes too far and then they f*** it up this might be where they played the role of Icarus

1021
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Bluetooth close to be linguistics.

1022
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,743
But getting further away from it

1023
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
And Collective

1024
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
So in the next

1025
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
Jason talks about his time

1026
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Up there and

1027
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,935
He said some things

1028
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Is that are like

1029
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Alex Jones

1030
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,823
You claimed that you were going

1031
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Planet

1032
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Interstellar

1033
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,223
Going to other civilization

1034
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Swaggin I'm not sure

1035
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Part of a

1036
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Seditionary

1037
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Force

1038
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
That would be

1039
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Innocent

1040
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,839
Tortoise sounds like colonizing

1041
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
Other planets

1042
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Giving offer

1043
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Bring our services

1044
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:58,079
As a military

1045
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Deceptive layer in there

1046
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
If you're using the word fall

1047
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
Trying to say that we weren't really fighting for them

1048
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,135
We're pulling the strings

1049
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
We're also responsible for

1050
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
The

1051
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,583
Organization and The Invasion

1052
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Creating

1053
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Highbridge

1054
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
To create

1055
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Dancewear

1056
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
We were invited in

1057
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Is that way they create

1058
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
The problem and the solution at

1059
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Christmas door

1060
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
And you're able

1061
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Go to

1062
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
Franchise

1063
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Please

1064
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,367
Control mechanism out to other plan

1065
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
Globalist

1066
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,023
Damn the speaker what he's describing and

1067
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Spit it out rice

1068
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,863
Get it out of your goddamn

1069
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,727
He's describing exactly what Alex has the country

1070
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,543
This is exactly the same

1071
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Storyline

1072
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
But now we have

1073
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,175
It's like Warcraft becoming Starcraft

1074
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
Itsjusta6

1075
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Isn't so stupid

1076
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,279
There's such a consistency in this because it does

1077
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
Tap into one of those big fears

1078
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Especially among white people

1079
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
But which is like

1080
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
They're going to do it to us

1081
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,103
You know like look at all the, all the colonial Isaac

1082
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,503
We did exactly these fictional people

1083
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
There's an underlying fear of like

1084
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
Oh we got it,

1085
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:49,439
Ghetto we just have to really hard to make sure it doesn't happen even though we deserve it

1086
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
100%

1087
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,351
Either these guys telling other do we on Earth run any kind of risk

1088
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
Space.com

1089
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Did you start oven temp

1090
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
Implied cooperation

1091
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,823
Between our secret space program and the Mars

1092
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Billabong to get along

1093
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:15,551
Whatever I'm just fascinated by how almost no matter what where you going

1094
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
These disparate places

1095
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
You think that they're talking about different things but

1096
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
But you scratch

1097
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
The surface a little bit

1098
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,743
And you find the exact same ideology

1099
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Promoted

1100
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
See Steve this guy who's trying to talk about his time

1101
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,423
Super Soldier on mars or whatever

1102
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
And he's just

1103
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
Saying the same things

1104
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
With different apps

1105
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
Gives Alex Jones

1106
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
You look at Jim Bakker you think he's a

1107
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,431
Christian preacher Republican

1108
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,759
Alright talking points about the migrant

1109
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Caravan

1110
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
Stuff like that

1111
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,623
You just like all of these worlds are so Blended together

1112
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
With just different clothing

1113
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,719
Which is

1114
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,279
The sport of rhetoric that leads towards

1115
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:07,007
It makes sense because they all hang out in like the same corner

1116
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
Right

1117
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,895
Individual had an interest in both

1118
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:19,039
Christianity and Allergy

1119
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,319
Boards and people

1120
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
Just kept going for me

1121
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,743
Play say that's true but don't do what they do is like all of these three worlds Beyond them being like basin

1122
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Call the car

1123
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
Job

1124
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
What they do their purpose

1125
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,423
She would do this for years

1126
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
Start s*** out

1127
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
About space

1128
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:44,127
Kind of amazing she still doesn't know

1129
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,199
Twenty-something years on the radio hasn't proven one

1130
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Victory

1131
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
He's against the global

1132
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
2016 election

1133
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,647
You got Jim Baker Hughes do not yelling

1134
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,743
Right

1135
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
Behind the scenes

1136
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,071
And their actual effect on society

1137
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
So dis

1138
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
Trust

1139
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
Like mainstream sources

1140
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Think what they do is they

1141
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
You try and put a splitter into your brain

1142
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
Eternal into your brain

1143
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,847
Distrust of a shared reality

1144
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,919
What they do is they trying to force

1145
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,479
Encourage

1146
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,295
To use their worldview to see the world as

1147
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Supposed to

1148
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,855
The reality that we all share

1149
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
And by doing that you week

1150
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Give me abilities

1151
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Society to work

1152
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
So what is there really actually super

1153
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Super like profoundly damaging

1154
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,215
Influences on the world and they're playing the same games

1155
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,007
Just from different angles

1156
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
That all these people should really

1157
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
I mean caretaker prison

1158
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
Weezer

1159
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,919
I don't know what you do

1160
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
They need to have some sort of

1161
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,343
Absolutely the last you can prove anything you say

1162
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
But if Carrie Chasity came to

1163
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
To be tomorrow with a ripped

1164
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
Hey Dan this is my friend Glee

1165
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Maybe like

1166
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
I want to be thin

1167
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,375
I'll be goddamn Carey

1168
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:15,263
We'll do another Wacky Wednesday around like a guys

1169
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,455
But there are his hands and they're in play maybe we should believe some of

1170
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:28,319
I also approve anything I also think

1171
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,879
Makes perfect sense that these worlds

1172
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Tail into the right because as

1173
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:39,583
The right-wing has found objective reality to be their main enemy

1174
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,423
Reality

1175
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
Put some of that

1176
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
It's difficult to say whether or not

1177
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
The right-wing picked up that strategy

1178
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Lee from

1179
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Aldi store

1180
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
The success that they have Within

1181
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
If it's

1182
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
You know they only gets

1183
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Stronger

1184
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
It's no surprise that we see

1185
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
Vu fervent

1186
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Conspiracy theory

1187
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Forethought

1188
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,799
Write write each other down

1189
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,103
You know they say pull each other down

1190
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Further

1191
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
I don't know if we're going to

1192
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:29,247
Large truth with anything other than just

1193
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:34,879
Saying things what I strongly without well I think it's important

1194
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,903
Like when these things

1195
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Come up to

1196
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Bee-Line Bus

1197
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
News world

1198
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Be brought up because

1199
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
It is

1200
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,887
They support their all working to undermine shared reality

1201
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Like

1202
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,239
That's fine if the shared reality is

1203
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,519
Evil and wrong

1204
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
But if it's not then

1205
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
You are

1206
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
That's my point

1207
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:01,503
Bring that point up to people who believe that their reality is

1208
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Only makes them

1209
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Well that's why I don't

1210
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Exactly right

1211
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,647
Hit the brick

1212
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:12,511
Get out of here right across the aisle

1213
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,327
No that's what we got to do

1214
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,655
I told you that there was a clip that I found that I admit

1215
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
When I was going over

1216
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
I'm so glad

1217
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Is this made me

1218
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
So f****** hot

1219
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
I need you to put your bike.

1220
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
This

1221
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Is Jason

1222
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,223
Explaining how it all got started

1223
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,063
This explanation is unlike

1224
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Anything I've ever heard on Project Camelot

1225
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
It is

1226
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Lunacy

1227
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,975
The drinkers were behind the scenes

1228
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Pulling the string

1229
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
Because the original formation of IDOC

1230
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Who's back

1231
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
2

1232
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
The mark German

1233
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
Original moon base

1234
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Lease

1235
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,567
In order to least the proper

1236
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,687
From the daycare you work and build their first name day

1237
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Couple of things

1238
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
They had to

1239
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
5

1240
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,671
Troops to the Draco for you swear when they needed them

1241
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,487
The IDOC fleets were

1242
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
Find a note 10

1243
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,679
Bound for the Bazooka Ball

1244
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,775
SP program took over

1245
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
Desmares Germans original Moon

1246
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,991
So Jordan Avicii I know you followed that cuz of your laughter it turns out

1247
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:42,111
This was a sublease situation that broke bad

1248
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
Alright

1249
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
How long was the original lease for ever

1250
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,815
Otherwise why would you give

1251
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,863
Why would you be willing to give up

1252
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,727
Roots the seed that is not a standard part of a lease

1253
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,455
Dude

1254
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,247
That would make renting

1255
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,831
Real weird if everytime needed to get out of your lease

1256
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
You had to bring troops into it

1257
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
Right right on the off-chance

1258
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:25,631
Also I love the idea of like I'm looking for a new check it out with go

1259
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
Around Chicago

1260
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,127
Furnished Yu-Gi-Oh Android

1261
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Awesome

1262
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
I love that so weird

1263
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
We're living on the moon

1264
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
Mars Germans are

1265
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
German

1266
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
Are working with the Draco

1267
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,167
You at least in the movie Ghost

1268
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,727
Is it a whole moon or is it just some part of them

1269
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
It's just the moon base

1270
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,895
The Big Bun base with the bars Germans had on the witch

1271
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:14,527
Germans who are on the moon

1272
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,831
Also another really funny part about this

1273
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Is like a

1274
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Tony said that he

1275
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
To the Moon

1276
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
So Carrie brings up

1277
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
The stuff that

1278
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
The guy with the telescope who works

1279
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,143
To the bus station

1280
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
Nope

1281
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,519
Because of course the

1282
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
Of course

1283
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:47,039
How could you not assume

1284
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:54,207
To the bus station with see if it was above ground

1285
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
Camouflage

1286
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,607
In some way

1287
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,591
Where's the court

1288
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:21,855
Programmed you to civil court

1289
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
Unless you give me truth

1290
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
End

1291
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,863
We want to get out of this mood

1292
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
What are they what are they going to do

1293
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
Hey if you break this lease

1294
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
We're going to murder ever

1295
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,895
Why do you want to get out of the lease

1296
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Oh I mean

1297
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
Have you ever been to the Moon

1298
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
Pick Up Stix

1299
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,183
Plastic up on the Windows look I have survived in a lot of bad

1300
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Chicago

1301
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,791
You got if you're putting plastic up on the way to maybe start looking for a new place

1302
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Little bit

1303
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
I always put up last

1304
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
My Steve

1305
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,703
I don't know man I think that if you were

1306
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,495
Moon German

1307
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
You might want to keep

1308
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
Keep a foothold on the moon

1309
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,383
Does it imply that they went to

1310
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,783
They went to another Moonbase is that possible

1311
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:29,439
They were tracked

1312
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
Bedroom to a studio

1313
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
What the f***

1314
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,423
This baby so happy when I heard that I was like

1315
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
How the f*** did I miss that

1316
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,775
Cuz Jason voice is so f******

1317
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,847
It's at least issue so let me explain how this

1318
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
This whole thing start

1319
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
So

1320
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
It turns out the original

1321
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,527
They were not yet Butera

1322
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,063
They were on their way to becoming

1323
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Moon

1324
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Right

1325
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Could not read

1326
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,487
They just trusted me Draco

1327
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
You guys seem cool

1328
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
We're German Nazi

1329
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,727
If there's one thing I learned from the midterm elections

1330
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,263
It's that there isn't

1331
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,591
Controlling most places

1332
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:24,735
Rent control

1333
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:35,743
Do do do Drake

1334
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Keystone human

1335
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
They probably pay them

1336
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,631
Blood

1337
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,215
Write monthly

1338
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,775
What are moths like

1339
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
Well we can find out what movements

1340
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
We can't find out what Drake

1341
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
Draco's don't use the Gregorian calendar

1342
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,695
Allegedly from this interview they're based in Jupiter that's where they had commanded

1343
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:15,423
I read so high

1344
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
We're trying to avoid paying rent

1345
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
Sure

1346
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,247
So they sign a year lease

1347
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,551
Sure but they don't understand

1348
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
How long

1349
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
Jupiter

1350
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:38,719
How long how long

1351
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,303
So they're like oh s*** we won't have to pay this

1352
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
1020

1353
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:50,239
30 years right but everyone high-fives everybody doing great they realize they didn't save enough money to pay

1354
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
So they're in a crunch

1355
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Right

1356
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
Finally

1357
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
Will break the lease will give you a ride

1358
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,735
And then we'll get the SSP in here

1359
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,039
Because if there's one thing I know

1360
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
About space

1361
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,623
They love

1362
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Fooling

1363
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
American

1364
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,583
A Jupiter year is 11.8

1365
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Earth

1366
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
Watch long

1367
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,215
Be like a year is a month

1368
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
Tomorrow

1369
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
I can see this

1370
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,127
The other thing I really tickles me is Eid like

1371
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
Is it okay

1372
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,783
Abilities do the Draco have for up to

1373
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,903
Like the door or whatever help door is faulty

1374
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,255
Is there code is there like building codes on the moon what kind of Regulation

1375
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,559
Is there a regulatory environment

1376
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,655
Is there a renters Bill of Rights on the moon

1377
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:02,687
It doesn't come up because they were able to reach

1378
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
When they gave some

1379
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
He's my favorite

1380
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:13,951
This is me off.

1381
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,255
A follow-up question

1382
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
It carry

1383
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
Do your whole show up in

1384
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,239
Like I understand the idea that there's like

1385
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
You know

1386
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
War base

1387
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:33,919
Space law

1388
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
I'm willing to go with you that far

1389
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
Crazy Tuna

1390
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
Dig into that.

1391
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
Pissed off

1392
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:49,279
What kind of what kind of universe doesn't exist without civil law

1393
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
That's a good question

1394
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,143
I think that's assuming that

1395
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,823
They're all tearing out a lot of democratic ideals

1396
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,847
Interstellar

1397
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:07,199
No matter what Mark Richards has ever brought to our lives

1398
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:11,295
Whether it's Raptors love chocolate no kill a baby for it

1399
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,831
Nothing to me top

1400
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Spacely

1401
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,415
Spacely

1402
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
The best

1403
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
F****** thing I've ever heard from one of these days.

1404
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,143
Litigate

1405
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,775
And I will watch the small country Phobos lawyer

1406
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,151
I don't know about your business

1407
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
How you guys

1408
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,271
Have a thriving Entertainment District here on the moon

1409
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,647
If your honor we would like to

1410
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,231
Oh no

1411
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
Space law

1412
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
That I find

1413
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
Proposed

1414
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
But this made

1415
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,175
This Paisley's there's nothing will ever be better than

1416
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967
Because it's such a boring

1417
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,343
Love Jason rice if only for that

1418
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
But here Tony comes in

1419
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,695
With some other weird face laws

1420
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
He might have been involved

1421
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Breaking

1422
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,583
So can't have diarrhea the pool even in space

1423
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
Doing something illegal

1424
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
Where were they doing

1425
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
We routinely stole

1426
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Cargo

1427
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
From other

1428
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,335
Colonies within the soul

1429
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,407
He thinks he's on solo

1430
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
There's a law that says

1431
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
That all the colonies are not allowed to attack each other

1432
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
When there were

1433
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
We would steal

1434
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Man

1435
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,191
I wasn't really prepared to think through every every infraction

1436
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055
There was bootleg things from Earth

1437
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,591
That's one of the one of the

1438
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:15,711
Hardest things that researchers have had with my testimony is that we used to listen to Earth music

1439
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,015
We used to do

1440
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
Cargo run

1441
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,855
Diego Garcia military hardware

1442
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
Or any kind of military cargo we want

1443
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
Diego Garcia in the middle of the night

1444
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,023
Only a few Personnel handful Personnel knew we were there

1445
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
And we would take cargo

1446
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,399
One of the officers gave a music player to

1447
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,727
A girl in communication that she was able to sway

1448
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:38,751
Music

1449
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
Let me know and nobody believed

1450
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,383
That's how I

1451
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
The main cargo bay

1452
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Movie

1453
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,039
What's wrong what's wrong

1454
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,599
There's a law against it there's a login

1455
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
Are the meteor from Earth as

1456
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
I guess

1457
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
Mind-control signals in it

1458
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:05,631
Able to listen to one song at a time like at the end of the day

1459
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,167
On the way back to the base

1460
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
He would listen to one song

1461
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:14,847
But

1462
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
Is it happen

1463
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Hardcore researchers

1464
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
From my from my testimony

1465
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,671
Because it's so illegal it's an illegal thing to do out there to take it kind of works

1466
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,279
Is interesting that you think that now

1467
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,143
Interesting that you think that

1468
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Interesting that you think

1469
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823
If you feel that way about some

1470
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Something I said

1471
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
First music is illegal in space

1472
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
Control messages

1473
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,759
But they could listen to one song

1474
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
Weather

1475
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:55,807
Eastbound & Down

1476
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,135
Is there a

1477
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,231
Hi-Point

1478
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:09,631
Convoy rubber duck

1479
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,263
You're listening to something from the era of trucking songs

1480
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
I got way worse

1481
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:20,639
I went all the way back in the prohibition era.

1482
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
Bringing space Hooch across

1483
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
Rush

1484
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,095
I would have play 2112 Overture

1485
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Cuz that's like

1486
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
20 minutes login

1487
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,359
Listen to Frog Rock up in space

1488
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
Prog rock in space

1489
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,735
That's a good that's a good point

1490
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
As you're driving around in

1491
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:05,951
Email I would want to go with something with a space time signature

1492
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:10,559
I want to go with like

1493
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
Let's see how it goes space-age Bachelor

1494
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
I would go with

1495
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,079
Honestly what I would end up doing is probably try to

1496
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,639
And piss off the people I'm in space with

1497
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,503
The Duke of Earl

1498
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:35,135
Stop saying dukedom band stop it

1499
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,095
No ma'am

1500
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,447
I love that there's there is

1501
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
Real estate law in

1502
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Yep

1503
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,823
Camp bootleg

1504
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,223
Repressive

1505
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,575
What's so restricted

1506
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
No movie

1507
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,159
But that does imply that there's

1508
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Space music

1509
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
Music

1510
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,607
By the way

1511
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,775
Technology is actually all hooskerdoo

1512
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,359
That's all hooskerdoo in March Germany Wagner

1513
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Like

1514
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,527
Choices

1515
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
All you can listen

1516
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,975
Is every cover of the spake zarathustra

1517
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:54,239
Very meticulous

1518
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103
Opera

1519
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Jethro Tull

1520
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,967
Baroque flute

1521
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,783
I don't think anybody at the Grammys

1522
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
He knows who this is

1523
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
Comedian named Jason Earl folks

1524
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,439

1525
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,719
Videos of Jethro Tull

1526
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,743
If you look almost

1527
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,791
Exactly like you on the University

1528
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
Freaked out

1529
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,567
Running around with a flute

1530
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,391
Aquiline nose

1531
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,927
Really annoy people

1532
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,767
Kind of like what

1533
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,375
I wonder why

1534
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,423
Podcast about Alex Jones

1535
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
High tolerance

1536
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Here we get to our last

1537
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
We need space

1538
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
That's what I said

1539
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,943
I would love to

1540
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Run

1541
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Chris Pace office

1542
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Is untenable system

1543
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
Space regulation

1544
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
I want to be

1545
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Populist

1546
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,927
Subspace

1547
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:22,559
Deregulated the entire real estate market we are regulating

1548
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,839
Music laws

1549
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,375
Freedom of speech

1550
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
The First Amendment

1551
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
All right I wouldn't

1552
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,983
Start with D regulator

1553
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,775
I don't know if

1554
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
I heard about that

1555
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,151
I don't know about that. Be regulated real estate

1556
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
That up there we'll get the super-rich off this economy of Mars is going to collapse

1557
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,255
Honestly that name

1558
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:04,031
Advocated for renters rights

1559
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,127
So we reach our last clip here and

1560
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
Tragedy

1561
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,431
The Falls the broad

1562
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,967
Oh no

1563
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,343
Freestyle for a little bit tell me anything that we might have missed

1564
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
Trouble strikes

1565
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
Just for

1566
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
You know 5 or 10 minutes

1567
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
Whatever whatever you'd like

1568
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
I can cover it

1569
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
If you think we haven't

1570
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Dealt with it

1571
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,167
Will carry first thing I'm reading the chat here and it looks like we're not online

1572
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,775
My audience

1573
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Don't know what happened

1574
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,663
Recording looking like it was recording

1575
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
It's a mystery

1576
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
S2 what happened

1577
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,087
Broadcast

1578
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Invite you guys back

1580
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Estimation

1581
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Andres

1582
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
Do it again

1583
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
If you don't mind

1584
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
Alright

1585
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,935
Thank you really appreciate it

1586
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:10,335
No idea what the hell is going on

1587
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:14,431
Some things that are pretty far out there so I think

1588
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
The course

1589
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,575
There's a real given the way he said that was so boring

1590
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:26,975
Like he's implying that there still are.

1591
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,839
Draco's

1592
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,887
Yeah

1593
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,935
Interfered with by alien

1594
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Anyways

1595
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
I guess we'll see you in

1596
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
Here is my

1597
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,823
Occam's razor answer

1598
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,847
Surfer what happened

1599
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
Carrie was super

1600
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,687
Distracted by the idea of having two people on Skype so I won't

1601
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
I forgot to hit

1602
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
It f****** record

1603
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
That's what happened

1604
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,415
Beginning of the episode

1605
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,255
Omnifarious that the video didn't record but she has the audio up

1606
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:06,655
I thought you would still found this anyways like maybe wasn't

1607
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,495
Streaming recorded the audio

1608
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
But the video she was

1609
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,080
Recording through YouTube

1610
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,408
Chew streaming it live on YouTube and recording it that way not

1611
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,296
Through like the way we do it through a recording software has a bad process

1612
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
That she follows

1613
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
And she

1614
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,184
Look she's done a lot of shows sure but that doesn't mean that you didn't forget to hit

1615
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
Record once it happen

1616
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,096
We've done a couple shows where we lost a couple shows those are not usually in

1617
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
Resume not hitting

1618
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,240
Crazy

1619
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:46,848
Not a couple of instances where I had like

1620
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Almost

1621
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,920
No space remaining on my computer

1622
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Because I just

1623
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
Didn't know how to

1624
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:57,344
Erase temporary files

1625
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,184
Five minutes of an episode

1626
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,048
Who issues do happen especially when you're kind of dumb like me or Carrie

1627
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
Cheeseburger

1628
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,120
Hit record

1629
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
Going on

1630
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,752
She's trying to log on.

1631
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
She's trying to record

1632
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
She's trying to scream

1633
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,616
Think about a second album

1634
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Google

1635
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Look

1636
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
She's hasn't announced

1637
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:26,016
Thanksgiving about

1638
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
I'm thinking about it

1639
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
I'm hoping for

1640
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
Look

1641
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
Here's the deal

1642
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
What to do

1643
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
It's up sodas

1644
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
I'm suddenly

1645
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Wondering about

1646
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,728
I know I need a lease

1647
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,264
Myself

1648
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,056
Haha

1649
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,896
Is your girlfriend

1650
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,992
Possible

1651
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,552
Trip

1652
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
Oh yeah

1653
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,160
She has kids

1654
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,584
I would say that

1655
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,656
In the Obama

1656
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
Deception stuff

1657
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,496
It's really hard to

1658
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
When you get a call

1659
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,336
This is so like

1660
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:26,944
I'm not going to say that I recharged my batteries cuz that would be

1661
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:31,552
Deeply dishonest man I needed something like that

1662
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,368
Mcfucking weirdos talking about space Germans and

1663
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
Yeah yeah

1664
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,792
That last two hours almost that much

1665
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
Better that the episode ends with

1666
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
I forgot.

1667
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,568
Somebody needed to of Ashish

1668
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
I know she would have liked

1669
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
But she should have added

1670
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,200
Price is Right

1671
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Slide whistle

1672
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,256
Congratulations Gary you have proved everything

1673
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,864
I have such a weird relationship

1674
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,936
Project Camelot

1675
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Replumb the dab

1676
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
Swift like Eddie page

1677
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,312
I'm surprised

1678
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
Legitimately thought that

1679
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
Project Camelot was going to be like

1680
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:34,528
But we're going to do a couple of fun episodes maybe of Mark Richards shows up again will do another one of those but I

1681
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,320
Legit

1682
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,160
In the same way that we're done with Jim Bakker

1683
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:45,280
How do you spell largely emotionally done with it

1684
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,304
More than

1685
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
Yes people.

1686
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,424
No it turns out every now and again

1687
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
Just f*** around

1688
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:56,800
Disappeared

1689
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
For twenty years into space

1690
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,152
Illuminati sex slaves and majors and

1691
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
Secret space program

1692
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Because

1693
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Dispute

1694
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,832
This is so great like this is

1695
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,440
Got to love it I love it all of the Project Camelot

1696
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
Everybody seems like they

1697
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
I've always

1698
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
I've been trying to out

1699
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Dudum cell

1700
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:26,496
Do you make it as grounded as possible

1701
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,336
Is absolutely the one who came in with teaming with fleas

1702
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
You still on that tip

1703
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,944
It's the

1704
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
You know

1705
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:42,112
Like how did the space believe live we've had Mark Richards he's flying around

1706
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
Solving problems that old is just like a regular

1707
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:53,888
Sex slave Joel elevated himself

1708
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,680
To become basically Han Solo

1709
01:24:55,936 --> 01:25:01,056
Dark trap

1710

Eventually owns her own brothel every single motherfuker who comes on here who's in space

1711
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,648
This is the equivalent of someone who's like

1712
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
It sucks

1713
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
Lake duck knowing

1714
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:28,704

01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
And there's soap

1722
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,088

Minutiae of Modern Life

01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,864
Is day-to-day life that is now being mirrored

1727
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,960
Pictures of really good improviser

Understand

1734
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320

Tony

1738
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:26,816
Space Germans for getting out of that lease that was tough to do

1739
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
Congratulation

1740
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,336
You're stuck in that lease

1741
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,920
When I lived like when my house burned down

1742
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,200
Years back

1743
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Terrible landlord

1744
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,296
And apartment

1745
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,600
Completely destroyed so like it was condemned

1746
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,904
By the fire department

1747
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
So they let us out

1748
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
And that was the case with a number

1749
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
How many troops did you have

1750
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
535

1751
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,376
But there were a bunch of other

1752
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,192
Unit in the building that weren't that damaged

1753
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:07,520
Expensive like smoke damage or water damage

1754
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
For one day

1755
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,080
Firefighter's prayer

1756
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:14,688
Yep.

1757
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,224
But they refused to let the p

1758
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,504
People out of the lease because

1759
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
The fire department didn't

1760
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
You say you had to

1761
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,088

1762
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,624
Stuck in their leases in

1763
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
Slightly

1764
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
We destroyed apartment

1765
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,744
It was horrible like I remember learning about that

1766
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
That kind of behavior

1767
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,584
That's what I would expect out of the Broncos

1768
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
Congratulations

1769
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,240

Are better people

1773
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,176
Draco run

1774
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,504
Nazis in the hollow Earth there are not good

1775
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
They are very

1776
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,416
Burberry

You're you're on this

1778
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,768
Creeping moral relativism

1779
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,584
Moral relativism

That's the cowardice

1785
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,344
Cowardice cowardice that allows Injustice elsewhere to return

1786
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:36,864

1787
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,960
